    "# A template notebook to compute network motifs from a GRN\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "### - 1) run mFinder from Uri Alon's lab\n",
    "### - 2) extract the network motif scores\n",
    "### - 3) extract the nodes (genes) corresponding to each network motif, save as a dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOTES\n",
    "- mFinder is a package to compute network motifs, a pattern of motifs that is over-represented than randomly permuted network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Designed for Windows machine, but can run on Linux environment.\n",
    "- mfinder 1.21 is used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **EDIT**: we wrote a set of python scripts to process the GRN and run mFinder for each cell-type to compute the network motifs. Then, another python script to extract the corresponding \"nodes\"(genes) from the GRN for each network motif, then save as a master dataframe. \n",

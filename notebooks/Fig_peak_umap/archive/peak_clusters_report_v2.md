# Peak Clusters Report

## Cluster 0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 contains regulatory elements that are most open in neural lineages.

1. Pseudobulk accessibility pattern  
   • Low/constitutive signal (≈1.4–1.8) in virtually every tissue at the bud stage.  
   • Strong, stage-dependent increase in differentiating neurons and neuronal derivatives:  
     – Differentiating neurons: 3 → 14 (0 → 30 somites).  
     – Enteric neurons: 6 → 16 (0 → 20 somites).  
     – Floor-plate, spinal cord, hindbrain and neural crest show moderate enrichment.  
   • Only background-level signal in mesodermal, endodermal or epidermal derivatives and in muscle.

   This profile is typical of pan-neuronal enhancers that turn on after gastrulation and remain active throughout neurogenesis.

2. Gene content of the peak set  
   • Neuronal identity / synaptic function: syn1, snap25b, syt1a/9a, sv2bb/c, rbfox1/3, nrxn2a/3b, cntn3b/5, nrg1, gria3b, grin2bb, grid2, ryr3, unc5c, epha6, sema5a, plxna3, tenm2, tnr, mdga2a, crmp1.  
   • Axon guidance & cell-adhesion (PCDH, CNTNAP, LRR, MAGI3, CTNND2a).  
   • Neuronal TF/RBP genes: nfixa/b, rbfox1/3, foxn2, trhde, trpm5, timm21, trim67 etc.  
   • Only sporadic non-neural genes (e.g. abcc8, wt1a), reflecting ubiquitous or neighbouring loci.

   Taken together, the gene list reads like a catalogue of late neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis genes.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   • Early neuroectoderm & multipotency: SOX (Sox2/3/19/21), FOX (Foxd3/Foxg1), PAX.  
   • Patterning / regionalisation: broad panel of HOX, DLX, LHX, IRX, POU, NKX, SIX.  
   • Differentiation-driving bHLH factors: NEUROD/ATOH, OLIG, TFAP4, TCF/LEF.  
   • Pan-neuronal nuclear receptors: RAR/RXR, COUP-TF (Nr2f), THRB.  
   • Cell-cycle exit regulators: E2F, KDM2, KLF.  
   The combination matches the transcriptional circuitry that converts neuroectodermal progenitors into region-specific, post-mitotic neurons under retinoic-acid control.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Peak-cluster 0 represents a set of enhancers that switch on when neural progenitors leave the proliferative zone and begin terminal differentiation, first detectable around the 5-somite stage and peaking by 20–30 somites.  They are shared by central (hindbrain, spinal cord, floor plate) and peripheral (enteric, neural-crest-derived) neurons, consistent with a “pan-neuronal maturation” regulatory module.

In short, cluster 0 marks late-stage neuronal enhancers whose accessibility rises sharply during somitogenesis and whose sequence carries binding sites for the major transcription factors that drive neuronal differentiation and regional identity in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 1

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 1 corresponds to a group of chromatin regions that are most open in axial-mesoderm lineages during segmentation.

1. Activity pattern  
   • Accessibility is already high in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) from 0- to 20-somite stages (≈2-2.4 a.u.) and becomes even stronger in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), peaking at the 30-somite stage (5.9 a.u.).  
   • Accessibility drops sharply in NMPs by the 30-somite stage and is low-to-absent in differentiated derivatives (fast muscle, epidermis, tail-bud, optic, etc.), indicating that these peaks mark the trunk-mesoderm programme rather than terminal fates.

2. Associated gene set  
   The 3 000 + linked genes are heavily enriched for developmental regulators that pattern the trunk and promote mesoderm maturation, e.g.  
   • Segmentation / patterning: dozens of Hox paralogues, mesp family, uncx, tbx6, tbx16, ripply, wnt3/5/11, fgf8/18, notch ligands, her/hes genes.  
   • Extracellular-matrix remodelling: many Adam/Adamts, Col I/III/V, Mmp, Lama/Lamb/Lamc, Timp, Fbn.  
   • Signalling and morphogenesis modulators: Fox (foxa/f/d/i), Sox (sox2/3/5/6/9/10), Runx, Mef2, Pax, Nkx, Pbx/Meis, nuclear receptors (Rara/Rarg, Rxr, Ror, Nr2f/COUP).

3. Motif enrichment  
   Motifs most over-represented in these peaks belong to:  
   • Homeobox (HOX, PBX, MEIS) → rostro-caudal patterning, somite identity.  
   • Forkhead (FOX A/C/D/F/I/K), SOX, TCF/LEF → integration of Wnt/FGF and maintenance of progenitors.  
   • NK/TBX, RUNX, MEF2 → mesoderm differentiation and early myogenesis.  
   • Nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR, COUP-TF, ROR, PPAR) → retinoic-acid and lipid/RA cross-talk that times somite maturation.  
   • Pro-proliferative sets (E2F, NF-Y) → sustained cell-cycle activity of elongating PSM.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Together, the expression profile, gene content and motif landscape indicate that peak cluster 1 marks enhancers active in trunk extension and somitogenesis.  These elements integrate Wnt/FGF (axis elongation), retinoic-acid (maturation) and cell-cycle inputs to drive the HOX-centred transcriptional network that specifies positional identity and orchestrates the transition from multipotent NMPs to segmental PSM tissue.

In short, peak cluster 1 captures the regulatory blueprint of the elongating presomitic mesoderm—highly accessible while the embryo is making somites, then largely shut down as tissues terminally differentiate.
]

## Cluster 2

[*assistant*:
Peak‐cluster 2 corresponds to a large group of very “generic” peaks that behave almost like housekeeping promoters.

1. Accessibility pattern  
•  In every lineage and at every somite stage the pseudobulk signal sits in the same narrow window (about 4–6 on the arbitrary accessibility scale).  
•  No obvious lineage-specific spikes are seen (the single 22-value in 30 s enteric neurons is almost certainly a depth-normalisation artefact).  
→  The peaks are therefore constitutively open rather than stage- or tissue-restricted.

2. Associated genes  
•  Because the cluster is so broadly accessible it is linked to an unusually long list of genes – essentially a catalogue of ubiquitously expressed metabolic, structural and basic-process genes in early zebrafish embryos.  
•  The list contains many core cellular regulators (ribosomal proteins, chromatin remodelers, DNA-repair factors, cell-cycle genes, basal TFs, etc.) as well as a sprinkling of lineage-specific genes that are probably captured because their promoters are always “on standby”.

3. Motif/TF enrichment  
•  Motifs that typify constitutively open promoters are strongly enriched, e.g. E2F, NF-Y, CREB/ATF, SP/KLF, YY1, CTCF, NRF/NR2F, and basic leucine-zipper factors.  
•  Pioneer-type motifs (SOX, FOX, GATA) are also present, consistent with their ability to keep promoters nucleosome-free in early embryos.  
•  No single lineage-defining motif dominates, reinforcing the idea that the peaks are not restricted to a specific cell type.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, cluster 2 appears to be a promoter-heavy, housekeeping peak set that provides the basal chromatin framework required for general transcription across virtually all tissues during the 0- to 30-somite window of zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 3

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 3 corresponds to a neuro-ectoderm / neuronal enhancer module.

1. Spatiotemporal activity  
   • The pseudobulk signal is already moderate in undifferentiated neural lineages (NMPs, neural plate, neural crest) but rises steeply once overt neurogenesis starts.  
   • Highest values are seen in “differentiating_neurons”, “neurons”, “hindbrain”, “mid-/hindbrain boundary”, “spinal cord” and “optic cup”, and they continue to climb from the 0-somite stage to ≥30 somites.  
   • Mesodermal (PSM, muscle, somites) or endodermal (endoderm, pancreas, pronephros) samples show only baseline levels, indicating a neural-specific programme.

2. Gene content (selected examples from the 1 300 + list)  
   • Neuronal adhesion / axon guidance: CNTN1/2/5, CNTNAP2/3, LRRTM4, L1CAM family, ROBO1-4, PLXNA1-4, SEMA3/4/5/6.  
   • Synaptic vesicle and transmission genes: SYT2, UNC13B, SV2C, RAB3D, RIMS2, GRIN2A/B/D, GRIK2/3/4, GABRB2/3/4, CACNA1/2/4 sub-units, KCN* and SCN* ion channels.  
   • Neuronal transcription factors: SOX2/3/5/11/14/19, PAX3/6/7, IRX1-6, OTX1/2, LHX1/2/4/5/9, DLX1-6, HOX (especially B/C cluster), NPAS3, NEUROD family, ASCL1, OLIG2, MEIS/PKNOX, DMRT, SIX.  
   • Pathway components that pattern the neuro-axis: WNT1/3/4/7, SHH, FGFR1/2/3, NOTCH1/2.

3. Motif enrichment / inferred regulators  
   The motif analysis highlights the same TF families that appear in the gene list:  
   • SOX (stem/progenitor maintenance) – strongest overall enrichment.  
   • FOX and HOX/Irx/Pax homeodomain factors (anterior-posterior and dorsoventral patterning).  
   • LHX/DLX/MEIS/PKNOX and PBX (neuronal subtype specification).  
   • RA-receptor/RXR and E2F motifs, suggesting retinoic-acid responsiveness and a link to early cell-cycle exit.  
   • bHLH neurogenic drivers (NEUROD, ATOH/OLIG) and MEF2, consistent with later neuronal maturation.

4. Biological interpretation  
Cluster 3 therefore represents a set of cis-regulatory elements that switch on as neural progenitors leave the cell cycle and differentiate, and remain active in maturing neurons throughout the trunk and brain.  The enrichment for HOX/Irx/Pax motifs implies that the same enhancer set is reused along the rostro-caudal axis, while SOX/FOX factors couple early neural identity to later subtype-specific programmes.  Retinoic-acid and Wnt/FGF inputs likely gate this network, in line with known RA-dependent patterning of the zebrafish hindbrain and spinal cord.

In summary, peak cluster 3 marks the core neurogenic enhancer landscape of the zebrafish embryo: low in multipotent progenitors, sharply up-regulated from ~10 somites onward, and sustained in diverse neuronal lineages as they mature.
]

## Cluster 4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 4 contains a set of open chromatin regions that are already accessible in the 0-somite embryo and remain moderately open in most tissues throughout the first 30 somites.  Accessibility is strongest in neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMP), presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and all neural derivatives (hind-/mid-/fore-brain, spinal cord, neural crest, floor-plate, optic cup).  It is weaker or absent in fast skeletal muscle, epidermis and late tail-bud, indicating that the elements belong to a broadly “neuro-ectoderm/mesoderm” programme rather than a general housekeeping set.

The linked gene catalogue (≈2 600 loci) is heavily enriched for:
• neuronal specification and function – ion channels (CACNA, KCN, SCN, TRP, RYR), neurotransmitter receptors (GABA-A/B, GRIN/K, GRM, HTR), synaptic vesicle and active-zone components (RIMS, UNC13, SV2, SHANK, SYT) and axon-guidance/adhesion molecules (ROBO, PLXN, CNTN, UNC5, L1CAM, CDH18/22/23).  
• patterning/ECM and signalling genes (many Hox clusters, FGF/FGFRs, BMP/TGF-β modulators, collagens, integrins).

Motif analysis depicts a clear developmental signature.  The most over-represented motifs belong to:
1. Homeobox families (HOX, DLX, LHX, MSX, BARHL, TLX, GBX, VAX) – conferring anterior–posterior and dorsoventral neural patterning cues.  
2. Forkhead factors (FOXA/C/D/F/K/O, FOXG1, FOXI) and SOX family (SOX2/3/5/8/9/10/11/14/19/21) – typical pioneers of neural and mesodermal chromatin.  
3. Pax/Irx/Nkx/Uncx/Barx subsets and several Six, Meis/Pbx and Tbx factors – further supporting regional neural and mesoderm specification.  
4. A background of E-box (NeuroD/Ascl, bHLH) and MEF2/SRF sites consistent with neuronal differentiation and activity.

Taken together, peak-cluster 4 most likely represents a collection of cis-regulatory elements that establish and maintain the broad neuro-ectodermal transcriptional landscape while integrating axial patterning information from HOX and allied homeobox genes.  These enhancers stay accessible from very early segmentation stages and continue to support neuronal differentiation, neural crest development and mesodermal derivatives but are selectively shut down in lineages such as fast muscle and surface ectoderm.
]

## Cluster 5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 5 represents a set of early segmentation-stage enhancers that are

1. Most accessible in surface ectoderm  
   • Epidermis shows the strongest signal (log2 ≈ 37–39 at the 0- to 10-somite stages, falling to ≈ 15 by 30 somites).  

2. Also open, but to a lesser extent, in several early endodermal / mesodermal derivatives  
   • Endocrine pancreas and general endoderm (log2 ≈ 14–17).  
   • Enteric neural crest / enteric neurons (peaking ≈ 21 at 0 somites).  
   • Early trunk muscle / somites (log2 ≈ 12–15).  

3. Linked genes (∼3 000) are rich in  
   • Epidermal and epithelial structural components: many keratins (krt17, krt4, krt18a), claudins, cadherins, collagens.  
   • Early patterning and organ-specification TFs: large blocks of HOX, FOX (foxg1, foxa/f), SOX, PAX, NKX, MEIS/PBX, GATA, TBX, MEF2.  
   • Signalling molecules that pattern the embryo (Wnt3/4/11, Fgf receptors, Notch/Delta, Semaphorins, Eph/Ephrins).  

4. Motif enrichment echoes the gene content  
   • Very strong enrichment for HOX-PBX/MEIS, FOX, SOX, PAX, NKX, GATA, E2F and nuclear-receptor motifs, plus TEAD/MEF2 and AP-1 (FOS/JUN) sites.  
   • This combination is typical of enhancers that integrate anterior-posterior patterning cues with epithelial differentiation programmes.

Taken together, cluster 5 marks a broad set of “priming” enhancers that switch on at the start of segmentation, are especially active in the nascent epidermis, and remain accessible in other early organ-founder populations (gut, pancreas, dermomyotome, neural crest).  They appear to be controlled by canonical axial-patterning (HOX/MEIS, FOX) and epithelial differentiation factors, providing regulatory scaffolds that later refine into lineage-specific programmes as development proceeds.
]

## Cluster 6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 6 contains a very “promiscuous” set of regulatory regions.  
1. Pseudobulk accessibility pattern  
   • Accessibility values are uniformly high (≈ 4–5 a.u.) in almost every lineage that was profiled from 0- to 30-somite stages.  
   • It is especially strong in paraxial-mesoderm-derived tissues (PSM, somites, fast skeletal muscle, hemangioblast / haemo-vascular mesoderm) and in multiple neural derivatives (spinal cord, hind-/mid-brain, floor-plate).  
   • Accessibility drops only in a few late-stage samples such as epidermis-30 s and tail-bud-30 s, indicating that most peaks are already closing in extra-embryonic ectoderm but stay open in the trunk.

2. Genes linked to the peaks  
   • The list (≈ 800 genes) is a mixture of:  
     – Developmental TFs that control axial patterning and progenitor identity (large blocks of Hox a/b/c/d genes, Pax, Dlx, Irx, Lhx, Nkx, Barhl, Msx, Six, Sox and Fox families).  
     – Genes required for contractile/ECM rich mesodermal tissues (Actc1, Ttn, Ryr1b, Col11/12/18, Fn1a, Lama/Lamb).  
     – House-keeping and metabolic genes (ribosomal, cytoskeletal, mitochondrial, cell-cycle).  
   • The spectrum points to chromatin that is active in proliferating trunk progenitors that are still competent to adopt neural, mesodermal and even endodermal fates.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • Strongest motifs: Homeobox (HOX, DLX, IRX, LHX, NKX, BARX, PAX), Forkhead (FOX, FOXC/A/L), SOX, E-box / bHLH, nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR/NR2F/PPAR), E2F/FOXM1 cell-cycle regulators.  
   • These motifs mark enhancers that respond to retinoic-acid and Wnt/FGF signalling, drive posterior axial identity (HOX + RAR/RXR), maintain progenitor proliferation (E2F) and allow rapid lineage choice (SOX/FOX).

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Peak-cluster 6 represents a trunk-wide, retinoic-acid-responsive enhancer set that remains accessible in multipotent neuro-mesodermal progenitors and in their immediate neural, muscle, cardiovascular and haemato-vascular descendants.  
   • Because the same elements stay open across many tissues, the cluster likely includes both “house-keeping” promoters and versatile developmental enhancers that are reused by several lineages during early organogenesis.

In short, cluster 6 captures the chromatin “backbone” of actively proliferating trunk progenitors and early differentiating neural/mesodermal cells—a resource that is shared across numerous vertebrate lineages rather than being confined to a single specialised tissue.
]

## Cluster 7

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 7 corresponds to a neuro-ectodermal/dorsal-neural-tube regulatory module that is already open at gastrula/0-somite stage and remains accessible throughout segmentation (up to ≈30 somites).  

1. Cell-type/activity profile  
  • Pseudobulk accessibility is uniformly high in neural plate, hindbrain, spinal cord, neural-crest, floor-plate and tail-bud samples, but much lower in mesodermal (muscle, somite, PSM), endodermal or epidermal fractions.  
  • The temporal flat-top profile (little change from 0 to 30 somites) suggests these elements mark a prolonged progenitor domain rather than a transient burst of differentiation.

2. Characteristic genes found in the peak set  
  • Patterning / fate: pax3, pax7, irx1/2/3/4/5/6/7, uncx4.1, lmx1a/b, otx, gbx, vax, shox2 – all classical markers of the dorsal/intermediate neural tube and neural-plate border.  
  • Neural-crest and dorsal interneuron regulators: sox9, foxd3, zic1/2/3/5, snai1/2, prrx1/2.  
  • Axon-guidance / synaptic genes that begin to appear as progenitors mature (e.g. robo1/2, unc5c, sema3/5/6 family, gria / grik glutamate-receptor subunits, gabra/b subunits, shank, rimbp2, unc13b).  
  Taken together these genes point to dorsal spinal-cord / hindbrain progenitors that later give rise to neural-crest cells and dorsal interneurons.

3. Transcription-factor motif enrichment  
  • The most over-represented motifs belong to the Pax3/7 and Iroquois (Irx1-7) families, which establish and maintain the dorsal neural tube.  
  • Additional enriched motifs include Sox (border/neural-crest), Zic, Runx and Tcf/Lef sites, indicating Wnt-responsive chromatin and a competence for neural-crest specification.  
  • Virtually no myogenic (Mef2, MyoD) or mesodermal (Tbx6) motifs are enriched, reinforcing the neuro-ectodermal identity.

4. Developmental interpretation  
  Cluster 7 represents a set of enhancers that define the dorsal neural-tube / neural-plate-border territory under the control of Pax3/7-Irx code.  These elements remain accessible while progenitors proliferate and later feed multiple derivatives, including neural-crest cells and dorsal interneurons, thereby acting as a long-lived chromatin signature of the dorsal CNS lineage in zebrafish embryos.
]

## Cluster 8

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 8 marks a set of regulatory elements that become highly accessible in a handful of embryonic “organiser” and pattern-forming territories between the 0- and 30-somite stages.

1. Spatiotemporal activity  
   • The peaks are moderately open (log2 ≈ 10–12) in most tissues but show a striking spike of accessibility in:  
     – Midbrain–hindbrain boundary (17–21)  
     – Pharyngeal / branchial-arch mesenchyme (16–19)  
     – Tail-bud / posterior growth zone (15–19)  
     – Early fast muscle and optic cup also show above–average signals.  
   These domains are classical signalling centres that pattern the neural tube, cranial neural-crest derivatives and posterior mesoderm during somitogenesis.

2. Nearby genes  
   Peaks sit next to an extensive collection of anterior–posterior and dorso-ventral patterning genes, e.g. fgf8a, fgf17, wnt5b, en1/en2, gbx1/2, pax2a/5/8, lmx1a/b, otx1/2, barhl, dlx, irx, meox, tbx, numerous hox paralogues as well as cranial-mesenchyme factors (barx1, hand2, sp8/9).  The gene list also contains many extracellular-matrix and guidance genes (sema, slit, robo, fn1, col family), reflecting active morphogenesis.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   Motif analysis is dominated by:  
   • Neural-crest / border factors: SOX (sox10/9/5/11), FOX (foxd3, foxi, foxg1, foxf), PAX (pax2/3/5/6/7/8).  
   • Segmental and axial regulators: HOX-PBX-MEIS, IRX, DLX, LHX, NKX, TBX.  
   • Proliferation & differentiation modulators: E2F family, MEF2, NF-Y, Nuclear-receptor cluster (RAR/RXR, COUP-TF, NR4A, PPARG).  
   This repertoire matches the gene set and reinforces the idea that these peaks act as hubs for integrating positional cues, retinoid/nuclear-receptor signalling and cell-cycle control during early pattern formation.

In short, peak cluster 8 represents a broad patterning/regionalisation module: chromatin regions that turn on strongly in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, cranial neural-crest/branchial arches and tail-bud as zebrafish embryos begin segmentation.  The associated genes and transcription-factor motifs place this cluster at the core of the genetic circuitry that positions and subdivides the neural tube and adjacent mesoderm while coordinating their rapid growth and morphogenesis.
]

## Cluster 9

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 9 is a neuronal/ neural-crest regulatory module that turns on late in somitogenesis.  Accessibility is already moderate (log2 CPM ≈ 3–4) in most neural tissues, but it rises sharply in peripheral‐neuron derivatives, peaking in enteric neurons at the 30-somite stage (log2 CPM ≈ 11).  Signals also increase in differentiating spinal cord, hind-/mid-brain, floor plate and tail-bud neural crest, while remaining low or absent in non-neural lineages such as epidermis, hatching gland and early mesoderm.

The 1 400+ linked genes are rich in neuronal molecules: axon-guidance and synaptic adhesion proteins (CNTNAP2, CNTN3/4/5, LRFN2, SYT2, RIMS2), voltage-gated ion channels (CACNA2D1, KCNB2, PIEZO2, RYR2), neurotransmitter receptors (GRIK2, GRM7, GABRB2) and cytoskeletal/ signalling regulators (DOCK4/9, RAPGEF4, MAP3K10).  This repertoire is characteristic of maturing peripheral and hind-brain neurons rather than early progenitors.

Motif enrichment points to the transcription-factor grammar that drives this programme:  
• patterning factors that specify posterior neural crest and hind-brain identity (HOX-B/C/D clusters, PAX3/7, IRX, LHX, DLX, UNC-homeobox);  
• SOX, FOX and POU family motifs that sustain neural-crest potency and early neurogenesis;  
• MEF2, RUNX and E2F motifs, suggesting a transition from proliferation to terminal neuronal differentiation;  
• nuclear receptors (ROR, COUP-TF, RXR/RA-receptors) that often sculpt late neuronal maturation.

Taken together, cluster 9 marks enhancers that are progressively opened as neuromesodermal progenitors give rise to neural-crest cells and, ultimately, to posterior peripheral neurons—most prominently the enteric nervous system—between the 10- and 30-somite stages of zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 10

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 10 contains regulatory regions that are almost silent in pluripotent/early germ-layer populations but become progressively more accessible in paraxial mesoderm derivatives.  Accessibility starts to rise in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and nascent somites (≈ 5 som), and then climbs steeply in the myotome—especially the fast-muscle and general “muscle” pseudobulks—reaching its maximum at 20–30-somite stages.  Other lineages (neural tube, endoderm, epidermis, pancreas, etc.) show only low baseline accessibility.

The peaks are linked to a large cohort of muscle–structural and myotome-specific genes: classic sarcomeric components (acta1, actc1, myl1/3/4, myh7, myhz2, tnnt1/2, tnnc2), contractility regulators (ryr1/3, cacna1s, atp2a1), extracellular-matrix genes needed for myofibre attachment (lama2, lamb2, col11a, col12a, fn1), and virtually all core myogenic transcription factors (myod1, myf5, myog, mef2a/b/c/d, srf, pax3/7, tbx4/18, six1/4, etc.).

Motif enrichment mirrors this gene set.  The most strongly over-represented motifs belong to the MADS/MEF2 and SRF families, which are the main transcriptional activators of late myogenic genes.  Homeobox (Pax3/7, Six, Pitx), T-box (Tbx4/18/16), and E-box/bHLH signatures that bind the MyoD / Myf5 proteins are also enriched, fitting a regulatory cascade in which early somitic factors open these elements and the myogenic bHLH + MEF2 partnership subsequently drives high-level expression of structural genes.

Taken together, peak-cluster 10 represents the enhancer repertoire that governs the transition from presomitic mesoderm to differentiated fast-twitch skeletal muscle during the 10–30-somite period of zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 11

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 11 appears to represent an extensive set of cis-regulatory elements that are preferentially active in the neuro-ectoderm, in particular in neural-tube and early neuronal lineages of the posterior CNS (hind-brain / spinal cord) during segmentation stages.

Key observations

1. Gene neighbourhoods  
   • The associated genes are strongly biased towards neuronal/neurite genes (e.g. ADGRL3, AP3B2, CACNA2D1/2D3, ERBB4, GABRB2, IQSEC1, KCNJ6, NPAS3, PIEZO2, PLCB1, RIMS2, RYR2, SEMA4F, UNC13B, UNC5C, TENM2, TMEM132C).  
   • Numerous cell-adhesion molecules and axon-guidance cues (cadherins, protocadherins, CNTNs, CNTNAPs, ROBO2/3, PLXNs, SLITs) underscore a role in neuronal path-finding and circuit formation.  
   • A large block of posterior HOX genes (C8-C13 class, Hoxb4/5/6/7/8/9, Hoxc/d10-13, Meis/Pbx cofactors) plus PBX/MEIS and Uncx motifs, points to rostro-caudal patterning of the neural tube.

2. Motif / TF enrichment  
   • Very strong enrichment for Sox family motifs (sox2/3/5/9/10/11/17/19) characteristic of neuro-ectodermal progenitors and neural-crest derivatives.  
   • Abundant Fox motifs (FoxA/C/D/F/I/K/L/O, FoxG1) and Paired-box motifs (Pax2/3/5/6/7/8), all central to neural-tube regionalisation.  
   • Posterior patterning factors: Hox, Meis/Pbx, Irx, Tbx, Six, Nkx, Lhx clusters.  
   • Nuclear receptor motifs for retinoic-acid and thyroid-hormone receptors (RAR/RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR, PPARS) consistent with RA-dependent posterior neural identity.  
   • Neuronal differentiation / synaptogenesis regulators (Mef2, NeuroD/Neurog, Atoh1/7, Runx, Ets/Elk, Egr, Batf/Jun/Fos AP-1).  
   • Proliferative E2F and cell-cycle motifs, indicating activity in cycling neural progenitors as well.

3. Pseudobulk accessibility profile  
   Accessibility is high and relatively uniform (40–55 CPM) across most neural tissues (neural tube, hindbrain, spinal cord, neural crest, neurons) and much lower in mesodermal/endodermal samples, supporting neural specificity.

Summary  
Cluster 11 marks regulatory regions that are:  
• active from 0- to 30-somite stages;  
• enriched in neural progenitors and differentiating neurons of the hind-brain and spinal cord;  
• controlled by Sox/Fox/Hox/Pax/Irx/Six transcriptional networks together with retinoid nuclear-receptor signalling; and  
• linked to genes involved in axon guidance, synaptic vesicle release and ion-channel function.

Together, these data suggest that peak-cluster 11 comprises enhancers orchestrating posterior CNS patterning and early neuronal differentiation in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 12

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 12 represents a set of regulatory regions that become progressively more accessible during segmentation, culminating in a sharp activation in the nervous system – in particular the enteric nervous system – by the 30-somite stage.

1. Spatiotemporal activity  
   • Accessibility is modest and fairly uniform (log2-signal ≈ 2.7–3.2) in most tissues at 0–15 somites, including neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) and presomitic mesoderm (PSM).  
   • From 20 somites onward the signal rises in neural derivatives (differentiating neurons, hind- and mid-brain, cranial neural crest, spinal cord, optic structures).  
   • The strongest jump is seen in enteric neurons at 30 somites (log2 ≈ 15.7), indicating a highly selective burst of chromatin opening in that lineage.

2. Gene neighbourhood  
   The peak set is located near >4000 genes that are strongly biased toward neuronal identity and function:  
   • Ion-channel and synaptic genes (GRIA/B, GRIN, KCN*, CACN*, SYT*, SNAP25, UNC13)  
   • Axon-guidance / adhesion genes (CNTN, ROBO, PLEXIN, SEMA)  
   • Neuro-specific transcription factors (NPAS3/4, NEUROD1/4/6, RUNX1/3, PRDM15, SOX4/11, PAX3/7, ZIC1-5).  
   • Several NFAT family members and many Ca2+-responsive genes, consistent with activity-dependent maturation of neurons.

3. Motif enrichment (row 12)  
   • Dominant motifs: NFAT family (Nfatc1/2/3/4, Nfat5) – classic Ca2+-responsive regulators of neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth.  
   • Secondary motifs: PAX6/PAX2 and other paired-homeodomain factors that pattern forebrain/eye and peripheral neurons.  
   • A sprinkling of E2F and MEF2 motifs suggests concurrent cell-cycle exit and activity-dependent gene programmes.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Cluster 12 likely delineates enhancers that are:  
   • Switched on broadly at low level as neuro-mesodermal progenitors exit the tail bud.  
   • Subsequently amplified in differentiating neurons, with peak activity in enteric neurons as they undergo late-stage maturation and network formation.  
   • Controlled by Ca2+/calcineurin-NFAT signalling and PAX-dependent patterning inputs, integrating electrical activity with tissue-specific identity cues.

In short, peak cluster 12 marks the NFAT/PAX-driven enhancer programme that drives late-somite neuronal – especially enteric neuronal – maturation in zebrafish embryos.

## Cluster 13

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 13 represents an axial–mesoderm / notochord‐specific regulatory module that is transiently switched on at the very beginning of segmentation.

1. Cell-type / stage specificity  
   • The pseudobulk signal is ~300 in “notochord 0 somites” but only ~12–14 in almost every other sample.  
   • Accessibility falls rapidly in notochord at 5–20 somites (16–15) and is only modest in tail-bud, early somite, floor-plate and neural midline samples, indicating an early, highly restricted burst of activity that fades as the embryo elongates.

2. Cis-linked genes  
   The peak set is attached to many classical notochord / axial mesoderm genes, e.g.  
   – ta (brachyury), noto, shhb, foxa/foxf family, tbx16, vcana, various collagens (col9a2, col15a1b, col12/14/28), extracellular-matrix and guidance genes (flrt2, fn1a, flt1) and early patterning regulators (multiple hox, dlx, barx, lhx, pax, msx, uncx).  
   These genes are characteristic of midline specification, anterior–posterior patterning and matrix remodelling performed by the notochord.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   Motifs with the strongest positive scores (|z| > 3) belong to:  
   • T-box (Brachyury/T), Fox (FoxA/FoxD/FoxF), Hox/ParaHox, Nkx, Pax, Msx, Lhx, Barx/Dlx families – all known drivers of notochord and trunk patterning.  
   • A sizeable E2F cluster hints at a concomitant burst of proliferation while the notochord rod is being formed.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Taken together, the data point to a set of enhancers that open exclusively in the nascent notochord shortly after gastrulation. They orchestrate expression of structural (collagens, ECM) and instructive (shhb, ta, hox) genes required for midline identity, signalling to adjacent tissues and subsequent axial elongation. Accessibility drops once the notochord matures, consistent with the transient nature of early notochord gene-regulatory programmes.

In short, peak-cluster 13 marks the early, high-intensity notochord enhancer landscape that drives formation and patterning of the zebrafish axial mesoderm during the 0–5-somite window.
]

## Cluster 14

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 14 corresponds to a set of regulatory regions that become progressively more open as development proceeds and that are most accessible in definitive endoderm–derived tissues (gut tube/endocrine pancreas) and, to a lesser extent, in metabolically active mesodermal derivatives such as heart myocardium and maturing somites.

1. Accessibility profile  
   • Very high signal in endoderm and endocrine-pancreas pseudobulks (log-counts ~12–24), rising steadily from the 0- to 30-somite stages.  
   • Secondary but consistent accessibility in heart, pharyngeal arches and late somites; only baseline signal in neural, epidermal or tail-bud samples.  
   • The pattern therefore tracks the appearance and maturation of trunk endoderm (fore-/mid-gut, hepatopancreatic domain) together with neighbouring lateral-plate/ cardiopharyngeal mesoderm.

2. Gene content  
   The peak list is strongly enriched for genes that drive or characterise endodermal organogenesis and lipid / sterol metabolism:  
   – Transcriptional regulators: gata4/5/6, hnf1ba/b, hnf4a/b/g, pdx1, onecut1/2/3, foxa1/a2, rfx6, nr1h4 (FXR), nr1h5, nr5a1/2, nr2f family, etc.  
   – Signalling / ECM genes associated with gut and pancreatic morphogenesis: fgf10/11/22, fgfr1/2, tnc, fn1b, multiple collagens (col12/14/17/18), adamts / adamtsl members, integrins (itga3/5/6, itgb1/5) and laminins (lamc1, lama1/2/5).  
   – Metabolic transporters and enzymes (slc10a2, slc27, slc2a family, abca/abcb/abcc members, cyp enzymes, apoa/apoc, srebf pathway components).  
   – Cardiovascular/mesodermal markers (hand2, gata5/6, vegfa/c, kdrl, flt4, tcf21, tnnt2a, myh6/7).

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   Cluster-14 peaks are highly enriched for bHLH-Zip and MiT/TFE-family motifs:  
   • circadian/metabolic regulators – BHLHE40/41 (DEC1/2), CLOCK/ARNTL (BMAL1), USF2, JDP2.  
   • MiT/TFE family – MITFa/b, TFEB, TFEC, TFE3a/b.  
   • Lipid/sterol regulators – SREBF1 and SREBF2.  
   • Oxidative-stress & redox sensors – BACH1/2.  
   Collectively these motifs point to a transcriptional network that links metabolic and circadian inputs to differentiation of secretory- and metabolism-oriented organs.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   The combination of (i) high, late accessibility in endoderm-derived organs, (ii) a gene roster rich in hepatopancreatic, intestinal and cardiovascular factors, and (iii) motifs for metabolic/circadian TFs suggests that peak-cluster 14 marks enhancer elements that coordinate maturation of gut-associated endoderm (including pancreas and liver anlagen) with adjacent cardiac/lateral-plate mesoderm, integrating environmental (nutrient, oxygen) and temporal cues.

In short, peak-cluster 14 represents a metabolic-/circadian-responsive enhancer programme that becomes active as the zebrafish trunk endoderm and cardiopharyngeal mesoderm differentiate, driving expression of genes required for organ morphogenesis, extracellular-matrix remodelling and lipid/sterol metabolism.
]

## Cluster 15

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15 marks a muscle-specific chromatin programme that switches on late in somitogenesis.

1. Cell-type/temporal profile  
   • Accessibility is already measurable in paraxial mesoderm/early somites but rises steadily and reaches a sharp maximum in differentiated muscle samples, especially the 30-somite “muscle” pseudobulk (≈ 48-fold above background) and in fast-muscle fractions (5–6 a.u.).  
   • Only moderate signal is seen in non-muscle lineages (neural, epidermis, endoderm, etc.).

2. Associated genes  
   Peaks sit next to many canonical skeletal-muscle structural and ECM genes as well as myogenic regulators, e.g.  
   ACTC1, ACTA1, MYOD1, MYF5, MYF6, MYOG, MEF2 family, TNNC2, TNNI1/2, TNNT1/3, MYH6/7, MYH10/14, TPM1/2/3, DMD, FLNC, CAV3, COL1A1/2, COL5A1/2, ITGA1/8, ADAM12, ADAMTS2/3/6, TNC, PDGFRA/B.  
   The list is also rich in metabolic and calcium-handling genes (RYR2, PIEZO2, CACNA2D1, SLC24A2) that typify mature myofibres.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   • Strong enrichment for the canonical myogenic bHLH network: MYOD, MYF5, MYF6, MYOG.  
   • Co-enrichment of MEF2, SRF/TCF, TEAD, TCF21 and nuclear-receptor motifs (PPAR, NR4A, ROR) that drive terminal differentiation and metabolic maturation.  
   • Additional FOX, SOX and HOX motifs probably reflect earlier mesodermal patterning states that precede full myogenic commitment.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   The peak set corresponds to the regulatory landscape of the differentiating zebrafish trunk/tail myotome—predominantly fast skeletal muscle—during the 15- to 30-somite window. It integrates earlier paraxial mesoderm patterning inputs with the late, muscle-terminal differentiation programme that builds sarcomeres, remodels the extracellular matrix and initiates fibre-type-specific metabolism.

In short, cluster 15 captures the chromatin and transcription-factor signature of late-somite skeletal-muscle differentiation in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 16

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 16 represents a set of regulatory regions that are most open very early in development and then progressively close.

1. Spatiotemporal accessibility  
   • The peaks are strongly accessible in 0- to 10-somite embryos in cell types that lie along the posterior body axis:  
     – neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) and early presomitic mesoderm (PSM)  
     – notochord (highest non-outlier signal; 7.1 at 0 s, falling steadily to 6.5 by 20 s)  
     – tail-bud mesoderm and early muscle lineages  
   • Accessibility drops sharply as the embryo matures (e.g. NMP 6.4 → 1.4 by 30 s), indicating that these elements are switched off once axial elongation slows.  
   • An extreme outlier signal is seen in primordial germ cells at the 0-somite stage (82), a reflection of their globally open chromatin rather than a lineage-specific peak signature.  
   • Most endodermal, epidermal and optic tissues show either baseline (~5–6) or no accessibility, confirming the axial bias of the cluster.

2. Gene content of the peaks  
   The associated gene list is enriched for:  
   • Hox, Uncx, Dlx, Lhx, Irx, Msx, Pbx/Meis – anterior-posterior patterning and axial skeletal specification.  
   • Forkhead (Fox), Sox, Pax and Nkx family genes – hallmark regulators of early neural tube, mesoderm and notochord identity.  
   • Guidance / adhesion genes (Robo1/2, Cntn, Cdh18, Tenm2, Sema family) – consistent with active cell migration and segmentation.  
   • Signalling components (Fgf8, Fgf24, Wnt6, Bmp modulators, Retinoic-acid receptors) – linking the peaks to canonical trunk-patterning pathways.  
   • Cell-cycle and chromatin modifiers (E2F, Kdm2, Kmt2, Dnmt1) – reflecting high proliferative activity of axial progenitors.

3. Motif and TF enrichment  
   Motifs for more than 100 TF classes are over-represented, but the dominant groups mirror the gene content:  
   • Hox, Pbx/Meis, Uncx – AP pattern specification.  
   • Forkhead (FoxA/C/D/F/K), Sox (B/C/E/F groups) – neuromesodermal and notochord programmes.  
   • Nkx1/2, Lhx1/2/4/9, Dlx, Irx, Msx – spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm regulators.  
   • Nuclear-receptor motifs for RAR/RXR, NR2F, PPAR – pointing to Retinoic-acid and lipid-signalling responsiveness.  
   • E2F, Kdm2, Mef2 – proliferation and early myogenic cues.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Together, the chromatin profile, gene inventory and motif landscape indicate that peak cluster 16 corresponds to “trunk/tail-bud axial progenitor enhancers.”  
   • They drive the early transcriptional programmes that establish posterior neural tube, notochord and paraxial mesoderm identities while embryos are still elongating.  
   • The strong RAR/RXR signature suggests that many of these elements are retinoic-acid responsive, fitting with the well-known role of RA in terminating axial extension.  
   • The gradual closure of the peaks after ~15 somites marks the transition from progenitor state to differentiated tissue and the slowing of body-axis growth.

In short, peak cluster 16 captures the early, retinoic-acid–sensitive enhancer repertoire of axial progenitors (NMP/PSM/notochord) that is shut down once trunk elongation is complete.
]

## Cluster 17

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 17 represents a set of cis-regulatory elements that are open in many lineages but are clearly most accessible in anterior neuro-ectodermal derivatives – in particular the early eye/forebrain field and differentiating neurons.

1. Pseudobulk accessibility  
   • Accessibility values are uniformly high (≈ 5.5–6 logCPM) in “neural”, “hindbrain”, “midbrain–hindbrain boundary”, “differentiating-neurons”, “optic cup”, “telencephalon” and “spinal-cord” samples at every somite stage, while purely mesodermal tissues (fast muscle, somites, lateral-plate) and late epidermis show much lower or even absent signal.  
   • The pattern therefore fits regulatory regions that switch on very early in the neural plate and remain accessible throughout neurogenesis but are largely silent in mesoderm/epidermis.

2. Associated genes  
   The nearest genes are heavily enriched for neuronal and forebrain/eye functions: ERBB4, NPAS3/4, LHX6, NRXN2, RIMS2, SYT2, GRIK2/3, LRRTM4, SEMA4F, TCF4, POU-class factors, many axon-guidance molecules (ROBO1/2, PLXNA1/2, EPH/EPHrin pairs) and dozens of synaptic vesicle components.  House-keeping genes are few, indicating genuine neural specificity rather than simple ubiquity.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • SIX homeobox factors (Six3/6/7, Six1/2/4/5/9) – canonical regulators of eye-field and anterior forebrain.  
   • DMRT family members (Dmrt1/2/3) – broadly required for neuronal subtype specification.  
   • Multiple FOX, PAX, LHX, DLX, IRX and SOX motifs – all typical of early neural-plate and telencephalic gene networks.  
   • Virtually no myogenic, endodermal or mesodermal motifs are over-represented.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Collectively, the chromatin, gene-proximity and motif data point to cluster 17 marking enhancers that drive the earliest waves of head neural-plate, eye-field and telencephalic transcription, and that stay open during maturation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.  These elements are essentially inactive in mesoderm-derived tissues, consistent with a role in establishing and maintaining neural identity rather than general cellular housekeeping.

Thus, peak-cluster 17 can be summarised as an “anterior neural / eye-field & pan-neural” regulatory module that is already active at the 0-somite stage, remains accessible throughout somitogenesis, and is controlled principally by SIX–DMRT–FOX/PAX/SOX transcription-factor circuitry.
]

## Cluster 18

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 18 captures a set of chromatin regions that behave like early–mid-somite-stage endodermal enhancers, with a particular bias toward the hatching-gland lineage.

1. Cell-type / stage specificity  
   • The pseudobulk ATAC signal is very high in the hatching-gland samples (≈ 45–53 a.u. at 0–15 somites, then falling to ≈ 12 a.u. by 30 somites).  
   • Strong but lower signal is also seen in other definitive endoderm derivatives – endocrine-pancreas (≈ 12–16 a.u.), generic endoderm (≈ 7–10 a.u.) and lateral-plate mesoderm.  
   • Neural, mesodermal or ectodermal compartments show only modest accessibility.  
   →  Together this suggests the peaks open earliest in the pre-chordal/endoderm field, peak while the hatching-gland is being specified (0–15 som), and close again as development proceeds.

2. Regulatory logic  
   • TF-motif enrichment for this cluster (row 18 of the motif table) is dominated by the GATA family (gata1/2/3/4/5/6) plus Trps1 – a hallmark signature of endodermal and glandular enhancers.  
   • No direct motifs are listed, implying the GATA factors act mainly through indirect or co-operative binding arrangements.

3. Associated genes  
   • The peak-to-gene links include numerous classical endoderm / gland genes (e.g. gata5/6, foxa3, hnf4a, pdx1, isl1, otx2, gsc, angptl1, sox17, agr2, col2a1a) as well as many digestive-organ and secretory-lineage genes.  
   • Presence of hatching-gland markers (e.g. he1.2, hgg enzymes) and pancreatic endocrine regulators (insra/b, isl1/2, neurod1) further supports the lineage assignment.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   Peak cluster 18 most likely represents a cohort of enhancers that are switched on in the early anterior endoderm, drive hatching-gland formation, and remain active in emerging pancreatic/endocrine tissue.  Their activity is orchestrated primarily by Gata4/5/6 (and co-factors such as Foxa and Hnf4), fitting the canonical zebrafish endoderm gene-regulatory network.

In short, cluster 18 marks GATA-driven, endoderm-specific regulatory elements that peak in accessibility during hatching-gland differentiation and early pancreatic/endoderm maturation between the 0- and 15-somite stages.
]

## Cluster 19

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19 corresponds to a set of very broadly accessible DNA elements.

1. Chromatin-accessibility pattern  
   • The pseudobulk track shows relatively uniform, high accessibility (log₂ values ≈ 4–5) in almost every tissue and stage that was profiled.  
   • Accessibility drops only modestly in some late (30-somite) samples and is never truly silenced.  
   • The single conspicuous spike (≈ 37 in primordial-germ-cells at 10 somites) is typical of housekeeping promoters that are hyper-accessible in the germ line.  

2. Associated genes  
   • The peak list is extremely long and is dominated by “house-keeping” or multi-lineage genes (metabolic enzymes, cytoskeleton, vesicle traffic, ion transporters, etc.).  
   • Few, if any, lineage-restricted markers appear near the top of the list, reinforcing the idea that these peaks sit at promoters shared by many cell types.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   • The only strongly enriched motif family is GCM (represented by gcm2).  
   • In vertebrates the GCM consensus is GC-rich and is found in many constitutively open promoters; no clear, lineage-specific TF signatures are present.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Peak-cluster 19 most likely represents a “baseline/house-keeping” promoter set that remains open in virtually all embryonic cell types.  
   • The mild decline in accessibility in more differentiated 30-somite samples suggests that a subset of these promoters is down-regulated as cells mature, but they remain accessible enough for basal transcription.  
   • The GCM motif enrichment is consistent with GC-rich core-promoter architecture rather than a specialized developmental program.

In short, cluster 19 captures ubiquitously open, promoter-like chromatin that underpins fundamental, cell-wide gene expression rather than tissue-specific regulatory activity.
]

## Cluster 20

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 20 contains a set of chromatin regions that are open in almost every somitic cell population, but their accessibility is clearly stage- and tissue-biased.

1. Expression / accessibility profile  
   • Uniform, medium-high signal (≈ 4.5–5.5 a.u.) in most lineages at every somite stage.  
   • Marked early boost in posterior-neural territories (neural-posterior 0- & 10-somite stages: 14–15 a.u.).  
   • Dramatic late spike in the endocrine pancreas at 30-somites (64 a.u.), dwarfing every other sample.  
   → The peaks first open broadly, become especially accessible in posterior neuro-ectoderm, and are then maximally engaged when endocrine-pancreatic cells differentiate (~24 hpf).

2. Gene content (selected from >5,000 linked genes)  
   • Endoderm / pancreas: pdx1, gata4/5/6, hnf4a/g, hnf1bb, fgf7, tal1/2.  
   • Neuro-ectoderm: npas3, grm7, grin2a/b, lrf n2, pax6a/b, sox2/3/5.  
   • Axon guidance & adhesion: cdh18, ctnna2, robo1, unc5c, tenm2.  
   • House-keeping / metabolic promoters (kdm2b, ube2h, psmd4, etc.).  
   This mixed catalogue fits the “broadly open but later pancreas-biased” accessibility pattern.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • Strongest motif: KDM2B/CXXC (M05682, z-score ≈ 4) – typical for CpG-island promoters.  
   • Recurrent families: SOX, FOX, HOX/PBX, PAX, GATA, MEF2, nuclear receptors (RXR/RAR/PPAR).  
   • Additional lineage markers: PDX1, NKX2-, SIX, IRX, TBX, RUNX, E-box (MITF/TFEC).  
   Together they indicate promoter-rich elements that can be customised by multiple developmental TFs, with a late emphasis on pancreatic (PDX1, GATA, NKX) and metabolic nuclear-receptor inputs.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Peak cluster 20 largely comprises CpG-island promoters and neighbouring proximal enhancers that stay constitutively accessible from gastrulation through somitogenesis.  They are first utilised by posterior neural progenitors and then, more conspicuously, by differentiating endocrine-pancreatic cells.  The motif spectrum suggests these regions act as a transcriptional “landing pad” that different sets of lineage TFs (SOX/FOX early, PDX1/GATA/NKX later) can dock onto to drive tissue-specific gene expression.

In short, cluster 20 represents a housekeeping-promoter–rich compartment of the zebrafish genome that is broadly open, but reaches peak regulatory activity in the endocrine pancreas at the 30-somite stage while retaining moderate activity in neural and other embryonic tissues.
]

## Cluster 21

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 21 corresponds to the posterior axial/mesodermal programme that drives somitogenesis in the early zebrafish embryo.

1. Where the peaks are open  
   • The pseudobulk profile is highest in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), presomitic mesoderm (PSM), nascent somites and tail-bud (≈55-70 a.u. at 0–15 som stages).  
   • Accessibility falls steadily in the same tissues by the 30-somite stage and is low in endoderm, epidermis and most neural derivatives (<15 a.u.), indicating a lineage-restricted, developmental­-stage-restricted pattern.

2. Genes that lie under the peaks  
   The cluster is packed with canonical paraxial-mesoderm / segmentation genes:  
   • Core axial regulators – tbxta/tbxtb (Brachyury), tbx6 / tbx16 / tbx6l, msgn1, cdx1a/4, ripply1/2, her1/her7, eomesa.  
   • Somite boundary genes – mespab/mespaa, pax3/7, lbx1/2, meox1/2, uncx4.1, foxc1/2, lbx1, tbx15/18.  
   • Posterior patterning factors – an extensive HoxA/B/C/D repertoire (hoxb1-hoxb10, hoxa9, hoxc6/8/9/10/11/12/13, hoxd3/4/9/10/11/12, etc.).  
   • Signalling components of the FGF, Wnt, Notch and retinoic-acid pathways (fgf8a, fgf24, wnt3a/8a/5b, dll/hes/her genes, cyp26a1).  
   • Early myogenic and extracellular-matrix genes (myf5, myod1, myog, acta1a, col11a1/col1a1, fn1a/b).

3. Transcription-factor motif enrichment  
   Motif analysis recovers almost every TF family known to regulate trunk and tail development:  
   • T-box (TBX/T/Brachyury), Cdx, and TEAD (Hippo) motifs that drive axial elongation.  
   • Large blocks of Hox/homeobox, Lbx, Msx, Uncx and Meis/Pbx motifs – the classic Hox–Meis–Pbx code for A–P identity.  
   • Fox and Sox family motifs (including FoxC/F/L and Sox5/6/9/10/11/17/19) that couple mesoderm identity to epithelial–mesenchymal transitions.  
   • Pax3/7 and Runx/Ets binding sites linked to early myogenic and vascular fates.  
   • E2F and cell-cycle motifs, consistent with the very proliferative nature of NMPs and PSM.  
   • Moderate enrichment for nuclear-receptor (COUP-TF/Nr2f, RAR/RXR) motifs, matching the RA gradient that positions somite boundaries.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Taken together, peak-cluster 21 captures the chromatin landscape of the posterior growth zone that gives rise to paraxial mesoderm and nascent somites. The peaks are most accessible while cells are still proliferative NMPs/PSM, close as somites mature, and are largely silent in neural, endodermal or later muscle derivatives. The associated genes and motifs show that this cluster integrates segmentation-clock inputs (Her/Notch), posteriorising signals (Wnt/FGF/Cdx), RA-mediated anterior restriction, and the Hox code to coordinate axial extension, somite segmentation and the onset of myogenesis.
]

## Cluster 22

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 22 corresponds to a very broad set of regulatory elements that are open in many different somitic-stage cell types, but they become most accessible in surface ectoderm/epidermis (especially by the 20–30-somite stages) and, to a lesser extent, in maturing muscle and several neural derivatives.  
• Pseudobulk profile – accessibility sits around basal levels (log-CPM ≈ 6–7) in almost every lineage, but rises further in epidermis (≥ 8; the 94 value is an obvious outlier caused by a single extreme peak) and shows moderate bumps in late muscle, mid-/hind-brain boundary, and enteric-neuronal samples.  
• Linked genes – more than a thousand widely expressed loci encoding extracellular-matrix components (many collagens, fibronectin-1, laminins), cytoskeletal/adhesion proteins (ACTN, ITGA/ITGB family, cadherins, integrins), general signalling receptors (FGF, Wnt, BMP, RA, VEGF pathways) and housekeeping regulators (chromatin remodellers, RNA-processing factors).  This repertoire is consistent with genes that all tissues need but that epidermis and mesodermal derivatives up-regulate during morphogenesis and differentiation.  
• Motif enrichment – the dominant motifs are for TALE/HOX cofactors (PBX / MEIS / PKNOX), nuclear hormone-receptor families (RAR/RXR, COUP-TF/NR2F, ROR, PPAR), AP-1 components (FOS, JUN, JDP2), NRF/NFE2L oxidative-stress factors and some ETS factors.  Together these point to retinoic-acid responsiveness, trunk patterning inputs and generic stress- / growth-control pathways, which again fits epidermis and maturing mesoderm.  

In short, cluster 22 seems to represent a “core morphogenetic/RA-responsive” chromatin program that is accessible across most embryonic tissues but is maximally engaged in late epidermis and in mesoderm-derived muscle, supporting extracellular-matrix production, cell adhesion and retinoic-acid driven patterning during mid- to late-somitogenesis in zebrafish.
]

## Cluster 23

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 23 corresponds to a set of chromatin regions that are open almost everywhere and at every embryonic stage we examined.

1. Accessibility profile  
   • The pseudobulk signal is high (≈ 280–450 normalized counts) in all cell types, from 0- to 30-somite stages, and rises slightly at the later stages.  
   • No lineage shows a dramatic gain or loss, indicating that these peaks are constitutively accessible rather than lineage-restricted enhancers.

2. Genes found in the cluster  
   • The list is heavily enriched for genes with “house-keeping” or core cellular functions (ribosomal proteins, RNA-processing factors, metabolic enzymes, cell-cycle regulators).  
   • It also contains many ubiquitous or early developmental transcription factors (e.g. pax5/6/8, hnf4a/g, ctcf, tbp, lin28, e2f family, sox/fox/kdm/znf genes).  
   • Such a composition is typical of proximal promoter regions of genes that must stay transcriptionally competent in most cells.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • The most over-represented motifs are for Pax family members (pax2a, pax5, pax6a/b, pax8, pax1a/b) and the endodermal nuclear receptors HNF4A and HNF4G.  
   • General promoter/basal-transcription motifs are also present (TBP, LIN54, SSRP1, TOX4).  
   • Together these motifs suggest that, although the peaks are broadly open, they are poised to integrate tissue-specific inputs from Pax factors (neural tube, sensory placodes, pronephros) and HNF4 factors (liver/intestine, pancreas).

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster 23 most likely represents constitutively open promoter regions of widely expressed genes—“house-keeping” plus a cadre of early patterning transcription factors.  
   • Their continual accessibility provides a basal transcriptional platform that can be modulated by Pax and HNF4 proteins as the embryo apportions neural and endodermal fates.  
   • In other words, this cluster marks the genomic “common ground” on which lineage-specific programmes are later super-imposed.

In summary, peak cluster 23 is best viewed as a promoter-rich, ubiquitously accessible chromatin compartment that underlies general cellular functions while retaining regulatory hooks (Pax and HNF-type motifs) for neural and endodermal patterning during zebrafish somitogenesis.

## Cluster 24

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24 represents a set of chromatin regions that are open essentially everywhere in the embryo, i.e. they behave like classical housekeeping promoters.

1. Accessibility pattern  
• In almost every pseudobulk sample – from the earliest neuromesodermal progenitors to differentiated tissues – the signal sits in the narrow 3.4-to-4.2 log-CPM range, indicating constitutive accessibility.  
• The only noticeable excursion is a strong spike in late hatching-gland cells (≈45 log-CPM at 30 somites), suggesting that this tissue transiently amplifies the basal transcriptional programme when it begins secreting chorion-lytic enzymes just before hatching.

2. Gene content  
The peak set lies next to several thousand genes, the great majority of which encode:  
• Core metabolic enzymes (e.g. ACACA, GAPDH-family, FASN, CPT1, many mitochondrial genes)  
• Generic structural/trafficking proteins (actins, tubulins, clathrin, etc.)  
• Cell-cycle and DNA-replication factors (cdc-, mcm-, e2f-, smc-genes)  
• Broadly expressed transcription factors (E2F family, MYC network, FOXK/FOXO, PAX, TBX, MEIS, etc.).  
Such a gene spectrum is typical for promoters that must remain accessible in every cell to sustain basal cellular functions.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
Cluster 24 is not enriched for lineage-restricted motifs but for components of the general transcriptional machinery and cell-cycle checkpoints:  
• LIN54 (DREAM/MuvB complex that gates S-phase genes)  
• TBP / TBPL2 (core TATA-binding factors)  
• SSRP1 (FACT chromatin-remodelling complex)  
• POU2F1 (Oct-1; ubiquitous RNA-pol II initiator)  
• TOX4 (PTW/PP1 transcriptional regulator)  
These motifs reinforce the idea that the peaks are promoter-proximal and used broadly rather than in a lineage-specific manner.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, peak-cluster 24 marks the constitutively open promoters of housekeeping and cell-cycle genes that all cells need for growth, metabolism and division. Their accessibility is largely uniform across lineages and developmental time, with a temporary boost in the hatching-gland at the end of somitogenesis, when that tissue experiences a surge of transcriptional activity in preparation for hatching.
]

## Cluster 25

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 25 contains a set of chromatin peaks that become highly accessible as soon as the haemato-vascular lineage is specified and remain open throughout segmentation stages.

1. Cell-type / stage profile  
   • Accessibility is negligible in early progenitors (tail-bud, NMP, PSM) but rises steeply from the 5-somite stage onwards in  
     – haemangioblasts and “haematopoietic/vascular” endothelium (highest signal; 20- to 40-fold above baseline)  
     – nascent myocardium and endoderm–derived endocrine pancreas (moderate signal)  
   • Most neural, epidermal, muscle or notochord samples show only background accessibility.  
   ⇒ The peaks therefore mark regulatory DNA that is used predominantly by the emerging endothelial / blood progenitor compartment.

2. Gene neighbourhood  
   Peaks are positioned next to canonical endothelial and early blood regulators, e.g. kdrl/vegfr2, kdr, flt1, flt4, tie1, tek, vegfc, etv2, fli1a/b, erg, tal1, gata2, runx1, spi1, notch1a/b, sox7/17/18 and many vascular effectors (pecam1, esama, vwf, stab1/2, rorb, cldn5b).  The gene set matches the molecular signature of haemangioblasts transitioning to endothelial and haematopoietic fates.

3. Motif enrichment (TF network)  
   • ETS sites (Etv2, Fli1, Erg, Ets1/2) – core drivers of endothelial identity  
   • GATA / TAL / Runx sites – required for blood specification downstream of Etv2  
   • Forkhead (FoxC1/2, FoxF, FoxO) and SOX7/17/18 motifs – cooperate with ETS factors in vascular enhancers  
   • Homeobox/Hox and Pax motifs – reflect rostro-caudal patterning of endothelial beds and contribution of Lbx/Lhx/Pax factors to vasculature of specific segments.  

4. Developmental interpretation  
   Cluster 25 represents a haemangioblast / endothelial enhancer module that switches on shortly after gastrulation, drives the initial wave of vasculogenesis and is maintained as endothelial cells mature and segregate into arterial-venous and haematopoietic programmes.

In short, peak-cluster 25 captures the regulatory landscape of zebrafish haemangioblasts and nascent vascular endothelium during the 5- to 30-somite window, linking classic endothelium-specific genes with the expected ETS–GATA–Forkhead transcription-factor network.
]

## Cluster 26

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 26 is characterised by a very strong enrichment for motifs of the nuclear-receptor super-family.  The over-represented factors include the complete retinoic-acid receptor module (RAR α/β/γ together with their obligatory RXR partners), RORs, the COUP-TF/NR2F family, PPARs, thyroid-hormone receptors, vitamin-D receptor, oestrogen receptors and the NR5A/NR1H sub-groups.  Correspondingly, many of these receptors – together with the genes that make, degrade or transport their ligands (e.g. aldh1a2, rdh10a, cyp26a1/b1, crabp2a/b, ppar α/β/γ, vdr, rxr, thr) – sit in the gene list linked to the peaks.  Classic retinoic-acid target genes such as numerous Hox genes, as well as additional endocrine / metabolic regulators (e.g. gata-, fox- and cyp- family members) are also present.

Taken together, cluster 26 therefore represents a set of hormone-responsive enhancers that integrate retinoic-acid, lipid/sterol and other nuclear-receptor signals.  In the embryo these elements are typically active in posterior neuro-ectoderm, paraxial mesoderm and emerging endoderm-derived organs such as liver and pancreas, where RA and lipid-derived cues pattern the trunk and drive metabolic differentiation.
]

## Cluster 27

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 27 corresponds to a set of regulatory elements that are most accessible in posterior mesoderm derivatives and, later, in differentiating skeletal muscle.

1. Pseudobulk accessibility pattern  
   • Very high signal in the tail-bud at 0 somites (38.5) and in bulk “muscle” at 30 somites (49.2), with a clear enrichment in fast-muscle cells at the same stage (6.1).  
   • Moderate accessibility (≈4.5–5.5) in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and early somites (0-20 somites), but a precipitous drop in somites and NMPs by 30 somites (≤1).  
   • Low or absent signal in epidermis, neural, endodermal and floor-plate samples at late stages.  
   → This temporal profile fits elements that switch on in tail-bud/segmenting mesoderm and stay open only in the myogenic lineage as differentiation proceeds.

2. Associated genes (selected highlights)  
   – Myogenic/contractile: myog, mef2aa/ab/cb, myf5, tnnt3a, casq1a, tpm4b, acta1-like genes.  
   – Posterior patterning & segmentation: many posterior HOX (hoxb4-b10, hoxc8-c13, hoxa9-a13), tbx, uncx, lbx, pax3/7.  
   – ECM / adhesion typical of developing muscle and tendon: col5a1, col11a1a, tnc, mmp2/mmp14a, fbn2, integrin-associated genes.  
   – Signalling / growth: fgf11a/13a, igf1rb, igfbp2a, vegfba, ror family, pparda/pparg.  

3. Motif enrichment  
   The strongest positive motif scores belong to:  
   • HOX/PRD homeobox family (posterior axial identity).  
   • MEF2/SRF family – central to myogenic differentiation.  
   • FOX factors (FoxC/F/L/FoxK) – active in paraxial mesoderm and muscle progenitors.  
   • Nuclear receptors of the COUP-TF/PPAR/RAR families – consistent with retinoic-acid and lipid signalling in somitogenesis and myogenesis.  
   • SOX, TBX/PAX and E-box (bHLH) classes appear in the broader enriched list, again matching mesodermal and myogenic programs.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Cluster 27 captures enhancers that are first engaged in the posterior growth zone (tail-bud) and segmenting mesoderm, then become restricted to fast-muscle fibres as somitic cells terminally differentiate. The gene content and motif landscape point to coordinated control by HOX positional cues, FOX/SOX mesoderm factors and the classic myogenic regulators MEF2 and bHLH proteins, with additional modulation by nuclear-receptor signalling. In short, this cluster represents the regulatory architecture underlying the transition from tail-bud progenitors to mature trunk/tail skeletal muscle.
]

## Cluster 28

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 28 corresponds to a regulatory module that is almost exclusively active in neural-crest–derived and early neuronal lineages during the 10–30-somite period.

1. Cell-type specificity  
   • Pseudobulk accessibility rises sharply in “differentiating _neurons”, “enteric _neurons”, “spinal-cord/neural” and “tail-bud” samples, whereas mesodermal, endodermal and epidermal compartments remain at basal levels.  
   • Activity increases with developmental time, peaking in 20–30-somite embryos, a stage at which migrating neural-crest cells are committing to peripheral-neuronal fates (e.g. enteric, sympathetic and sensory lineages).

2. Gene content of the locus set  
   The linked genes are heavily enriched for neuronal and neural-crest functions.  Examples include  
   • Axon guidance / synapse formation: ERBB4, NPAS3, NRXN2, CNTNAP2, LRRTM4, ROBO1/3, RIMS1/2, TENM2, TCF4, CACNA2D1/3, GRIN2B, GRIK2/3, GABRB2.  
   • Neural-crest identity & migration: SOX10, FOXD3, TFAP2, RET, PHOX2B, PAX3/7, ZEB2, SNAI family, HAND2.  
   • Adhesion / ECM remodelling genes (PCDH clusters, ADAMTSs, COLs) that facilitate crest cell delamination and path-finding.

3. Transcription-factor motif landscape  
   Cluster-28 peaks are enriched for HLH and EMT-associated motifs rather than a single dominant “direct” motif:  
   • TCF12/E-proteins and HAND2 – drivers of neurogenic and mesenchymal differentiation.  
   • SNAI1/2/3 and ZEB1/2 – classical EMT regulators necessary for neural-crest emigration.  
   • MESPA/B and NH­LH2 – factors linked to early neurogenesis.  
   This motif spectrum matches the mixed migratory (EMT) and neurogenic character of crest-derived neurons.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Taken together, the expression profile, gene composition and motif enrichment indicate that peak-cluster 28 marks enhancers that become accessible when neural-crest cells exit the dorsal neural tube, undergo EMT, and begin to differentiate into peripheral/enteric neurons.  The cluster therefore captures the transcriptional switch that couples crest cell migration with the onset of neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 29

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29 represents a regulatory module that becomes strongly and selectively accessible in the posterior growth zone of the embryo.

1. Spatiotemporal accessibility  
   • Accessibility is low and fairly uniform in most tissues (log2 CPM ≈ 4–5).  
   • It rises modestly in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) by 20 somites and then explodes at 30 somites (log2 ≈ 64).  
   • The same late, high accessibility is seen in the tail-bud sample (log2 ≈ 71) and, to a lesser degree, in the 30-somite presomitic mesoderm (PSM).  
   • Other tissues, including neural, endodermal and optic derivatives, remain at background levels.  
   ➜  The peak set therefore marks the caudal progenitor/tail-bud territory during the cessation of body-axis extension.

2. Gene content  
   The peaks are linked to many canonical posterior-mesoderm and axis-extension genes, e.g.  
   – axial regulators: tbxta, msgn1, tbx6, cdx1a/4, wnt3/3a/5b, fgf19, fgf18, axin2  
   – segmentation genes: mespaa/mespab, ripply, notch1a, her/hes family  
   – EMT / motility factors: snai1a/2, zeb1a/1b, vimentin, loxl, integrins  
   – tail-bud metabolic and cell-cycle genes (e.g. ldhb, myc targets) reflecting the high proliferative state.  

3. Motif enrichment (row 29)  
   • E-protein bHLH sites (TCF3/12) – generic competence factors for mesodermal and neuro-mesodermal programs.  
   • ZEB and SNAI family motifs – hallmarks of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition required for tail-bud cell motility.  
   • HAND2 and MESP sites – associated with lateral-plate / paraxial mesoderm differentiation and somite boundary formation.  
   • Additional enrichment for PRRX and TCF factors supports posterior mesoderm identity.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Peak-cluster 29 captures the chromatin signature of late NMP/tail-bud cells as they switch from a multipotent state to committed mesodermal fates and undergo EMT-driven axial elongation.  The associated genes and transcription-factor motifs indicate active Wnt–Cdx–Tbx circuitry, segmentation enhancers (Mesp), and EMT regulators (Snail/Zeb/Hand), all of which are essential for continued body-axis extension and somite formation in zebrafish.

In short, cluster 29 defines a posterior body-extension enhancer set that turns on at the end of somitogenesis, driving the genetic programme that converts caudal progenitors into elongating paraxial mesoderm.
]

## Cluster 30

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 30 corresponds to a set of regulatory regions that stay weakly accessible in most tissues (≈ log2 accessibility 2–4) but “switch on” very strongly in two situations:

1. Posterior presomitic / somitic mesoderm at the late-segmentation stages (PSM 20 somites ≈ 8, enteric_neurons 30 somites ≈ 31).  
2. Neural-crest–derived enteric neurons just after they start to differentiate (enteric_neurons 30 somites).

Gene content.  
The associated genes are heavily biased toward  
• posterior patterning and mesodermal morphogenesis (hundreds of Hox, Pbx/Meis, Tbx, Mesp, Cdx, Uncx, etc.),  
• neural-crest migration / axon guidance / synaptic assembly (Sox10, Sox11, Sox21, Dlx, Lhx, Nkx, Pax3/7, Ret-/Nrg-/Nrx-/Grin-family receptors, many ion-channel and adhesion genes),  
• ECM-remodelling enzymes (Adam, Adamts, Mmp, Col families).

Motif enrichment.  
The over-represented motifs fall into four broad groups that fit this expression profile:  
• HOX / PBX / MEIS – posterior axial identity.  
• SOX, DLX, PAX, LHX, NKX – neural-crest and neuronal differentiation.  
• FOXA/FOXF/FOXO/FOXM & GATA – endoderm-mesoderm signalling and EMT.  
• RAR/RXR, ROR, PPAR, NR family – retinoic-acid and metabolic nuclear-receptor response.  
Smaller peaks for E2F and MYC modules point to cells that are still proliferating when these enhancers open.

Interpretation.  
Cluster 30 marks enhancers that are silent or low in early multipotent progenitors but become highly accessible as:

• posterior presomitic mesoderm matures into somites, and  
• vagal neural-crest cells settle in the gut and commit to the enteric-neuronal lineage.

Thus the cluster captures a posterior patterning / neuro-mesodermal transcriptional programme that integrates HOX positional cues with neural-crest-specific SOX/DLX/PAX inputs and retinoic-acid signalling to drive the emergence of late somitic tissue and enteric neurons.
]

## Cluster 31

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 31 represents a set of regulatory regions that become markedly more accessible in the posterior body of the embryo as somitogenesis proceeds.

1. Spatiotemporal activity  
   • Accessibility is low-to-moderate (log2 CPM ≈ 5-7) in most tissues and stages, but rises dramatically at:  
     – Newly forming neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs) at the 30-somite stage (≈ 56)  
     – Tail-bud tissue at the 30-somite stage (≈ 68)  
     – Mature somites (30 ss) and posterior presomitic mesoderm (PSM 30 ss)  
     – A transient burst in the floor-plate at the 0-somite stage (≈ 28)  
   This pattern is typical of chromatin that is progressively activated in posterior axial progenitors and their derivatives during the final phase of body-axis elongation.

2. Gene content  
   The associated gene list is enriched for:  
   • Posterior Hox and other patterning genes (many HoxB/C/D members, Uncx, Meox, Cdx, Lbx, Lhx, etc.)  
   • Retinoic-acid and other nuclear-receptor targets (Rara/b/g, Rxr, Rorb, Nr2f/4a/5a families)  
   • Axial-progenitor / growth regulators (Lin28a, Hmga2, Fgf18b, Wnt and BMP modulators)  
   • Extracellular-matrix and mesodermal-morphogenesis genes (Col, Adamts, Plxn, Pdgfra group)

3. Motif/TF signature  
   The dominant motif enrichment (row 31) is for nuclear-receptor half-sites and DR-type repeats that are recognised by retinoic-acid receptors (RARs), RXRs, RORs, NR2F/COUP-TFs and NR5A.  This, together with numerous indirect hits for the same receptors, points to retinoic-acid signalling—and, more broadly, NR-mediated transcription—as the key upstream driver of this cluster.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Taken together, the data indicate that peak-cluster 31 corresponds to a retinoic-acid–responsive regulatory programme that switches on in late NMPs/tail-bud cells and remains active in newly formed posterior somites.  The module likely orchestrates posterior Hox gene activation, axial termination, and the mesoderm-to-neural transcriptional transition characteristic of the end of body-axis extension in zebrafish.

In short, cluster 31 marks a set of RA-sensitive enhancers that dominate posterior axial progenitors at the end of somitogenesis, coordinating Hox patterning and differentiation of tail-bud-derived tissues.
]

## Cluster 32

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 32 marks a set of cis-regulatory regions that stay fairly quiet throughout most tissues but “switch on’’ spectacularly in the optic-cup lineage: accessibility climbs gradually during somitogenesis and explodes at the 30-somite stage in optic-cup/retinal cells (≈100-fold higher than the background, while all other lineages remain around baseline).  

Motif landscape  
• Strong, selective enrichment for half-site nuclear-receptor motifs (RAR, RXR, ROR, COUP-TF/NR2F, REV-ERB/NR1D, PPAR, ESRR, VDR).  
• Very little contribution from canonical neuronal, mesodermal or endodermal TF families, indicating a specialised regulatory programme rather than a broad neural signature.

Candidate regulators and nearby genes  
The same nuclear-receptor cohort that dominates the motif analysis is found in the gene list located near the peaks: rarga / rargb, rxraa / rxrab / rxrgb, rorb / rorcb, nr2f1/2/5/6, nr1d1/2/4, esrra/-ga/-gb, vdrb, pparaa/-ab/-da/-g, etc.  Many of these factors—and their metabolic/retinoid-handling targets such as rdh8, rlbp1-like genes, abca4, rgra—are known drivers of retinal and photoreceptor differentiation and of the metabolic rewiring that accompanies it.

Biological implication  
The data point to a late-somitogenesis retinal programme in which retinoic-acid, lipid- and circadian-responsive nuclear receptors orchestrate the final maturation of the optic cup.  Cluster 32 therefore represents retina-specific enhancers that are activated late (≈24 hpf) to couple retinoid signalling and metabolic control with photoreceptor/optic-cup differentiation.
]

## Cluster 33

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 33 corresponds to a set of very broadly accessible regulatory elements that are most open in neural derivatives throughout somitogenesis and that carry a clear “Pax / early-patterning” signature.

1. Chromatin accessibility pattern  
   • Pseudobulk values are high (≈ 22–27 log₂ counts) in almost every lineage, but peak in neuro-ectodermal samples (differentiating neurons, spinal cord, hind-/mid-brain, optic cup, neural crest).  
   • Accessibility is already maximal at the 0–5-somite stages and only modestly declines by 30 somites, suggesting these enhancers act early and stay active during tissue patterning.

2. Gene set linked to the peaks  
   • Contains many archetypal regional-patterning transcription factors: pax1/2/3/5/6/8, otx1/2/5, rx1/2/3, vsx1, barhl1/2, vax1/2, gbx1/2, uncx, lmx, lhx, dlx, six, irrx, nkx, msx and extensive anterior-posterior Hox coverage (hoxa1-13, hoxb1-10, hoxc1-13, hoxd3-12).  
   • Also includes genes typical of pronephric/otic programmes (e.g. pax2a/b, pax8, hnf1b, slc12a family) and early sensory placode/retina genes (e.g. sox2/3, vsx1, crx), consistent with the tissues that show the highest accessibility.

3. Motif enrichment (row 33)  
   • Strongest signal for Pax family motifs (Pax2/5/6 cluster) together with Sox, Fox, Lhx/Dlx/Barhl, Otx, Vax and a dense assortment of Hox sites – a classic combination for neural-tube, cranial-placode and kidney/ear enhancers.  
   • Absence of mesoderm-specific or late neuronal subtype motifs reinforces the idea that these peaks mark early, multipotent patterning enhancers rather than late differentiation elements.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster 33 most likely represents an atlas of early patterning enhancers used by Pax-controlled gene networks that regionalise the anterior neural plate/tube and specify adjoining placodal and intermediate mesodermal tissues (otic placode, pronephros).  
   • Their sustained but gradually tapering accessibility suggests that after establishing positional identity, these elements remain open to allow subsequent lineage-specific factors (e.g. Hox, Lhx, Sox) to refine neuronal, sensory-organ and kidney programmes.

In short, peak-cluster 33 is a Pax-centric, early-patterning chromatin module that underlies broad neuro-ectodermal, placodal and intermediate-mesoderm gene expression during zebrafish somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 34

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 34 corresponds to chromatin regions that are turned on mainly in neural–crest–derived lineages during mid- to late somitogenesis.

1. Temporal / spatial accessibility  
   • Highest accessibility is seen in neural-crest populations, peaking between 10- and 20-somite stages (≈40–43 AU) and remaining high at 30 somites (≈31 AU).  
   • A secondary, more modest signal is present in early notochord (5–10 somites ≈17 AU) and in early enteric-neural crest / neurons (≈9–10 AU).  
   • Most other tissues (PSM, endoderm, mesoderm, brain, epidermis, tail-bud, etc.) show only basal values (≈5–7 AU).

2. Gene content of the peaks  
   The nearest genes form a classic neural-crest / melanocyte signature: sox10, sox9, sox8, pax3a/b, pax7, foxd3, foxf2, foxi1/3, snai1/2, zeb2, mitfa, tyr, dct (pigment pathway), tfap2 family, lef1, notch1b, erbb3b, ngfrb, pdgfra, fgf13a, tenm2, plxna3, robo1, integrins (itga8/9, itgb1a, itgb8), collagen/ECM genes (col16a1, col18a1, loxl1/2), guidance and adhesion molecules (cntn2/5, cadm1a, chd7, epha4b).  These genes are needed for neural-crest delamination, migration and early differentiation (especially melanocyte and peripheral-neuronal fates).

3. Transcription-factor motif enrichment  
   The most over-represented motifs (z-scores ≳ 2) map to:  
   • MITF / TFE family (M09755) – master regulator of melanocyte specification.  
   • SOX (SOX10/5/9/2/3/21), FOX (FOXD3, FOXF2, FOXC1, FOXP family) and PAX3/7 motifs – core neural-crest GRN drivers.  
   • TFAP2, LEF/TCF, E2F, BACH/MAF, MEF2 and bHLH (NeuroD/ATOH/OLIG) motifs, supporting roles in proliferation, EMT and lineage restriction.  
   • AP-1 / CREB and BATF–JUN motifs, consistent with high migratory and signalling activity.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Together, the accessibility pattern, gene roster and motif landscape indicate that peak-cluster 34 marks regulatory elements active in trunk neural-crest cells once they leave the dorsal neural tube, migrate through the somites and begin to differentiate—particularly towards pigment (melanocyte) and peripheral-neuronal/enteric lineages.  The transient accessibility in the notochord may reflect shared dorsal midline enhancers used early in development.

In short, peak-cluster 34 captures the chromatin programme of migratory neural-crest cells and their early derivatives during the 5- to 30-somite window, driven by SOX–FOX–PAX-MITF centred regulatory networks.
]

## Cluster 35

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 35 represents a group of chromatin regions that are open very early in segmentation-stage embryos and whose accessibility is largely controlled by SOX-family transcription factors.

1. Motif/TF signature  
   • Strong, specific enrichment for SOX binding sites (Sox2/3/10/11/14/19, Sox4/5/6/8/9, Sox17/18/21, etc.).  
   • Minor co-enrichment for CUX homeoproteins and the HBP1 HMG-box factor.  
   → Implies that the regions are part of a SOX-centred regulatory programme typical of pluripotent ectodermal / neural-plate / neural-crest progenitors.

2. Pseudobulk accessibility pattern (ATAC-signal)  
   • Highest signal at the 0–15-somite stages in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP), presomitic mesoderm (PSM), forming somites, early muscle and diverse neural populations.  
   • Accessibility remains moderate in many tissues through 20 somites but drops sharply by the 30-somite stage in NMP, epidermis and some late neural derivatives, indicating a transient, early function.  
   • Very low signal in mature epidermis and late pancreas / optic tissues, suggesting these peaks are not part of terminal-differentiation programmes.

3. Gene content linked to the peaks  
   • Thousands of genes with over-representation of:  
     – Developmental regulators and signalling molecules (FOXL2, NPAS3, FGFs/FGFRs, ERBB4, AXL, WNT, NOTCH components).  
     – Cell-adhesion / ECM genes (numerous collagens, ADAM/ADAMTS, SEMA/PLXN, cadherins).  
     – Broad metabolic and cytoskeletal genes typical of proliferative progenitors.  
   • The breadth of the list and its functional diversity fit with enhancers that drive widespread early progenitor expression rather than tight lineage restriction.

4. Biological interpretation  
Peak-cluster 35 marks an early, SOX-driven enhancer set that is active across multipotent ectodermal and paraxial-mesodermal progenitors during the first 10-15 somites. These elements likely mediate the initial establishment of neural-plate, neural-crest and paraxial-mesoderm gene programmes and are progressively decommissioned as cells commit to more specialised fates later in segmentation.

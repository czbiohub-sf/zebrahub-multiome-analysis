# Peak Clusters Report

## Cluster 0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 corresponds to a clearly neuro-centric regulatory module.

1. Activity pattern  
• Chromatin from this cluster is already modestly accessible in early neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP) and neural plate/tail-bud (values ~1.4–1.7) but becomes strongly enriched as soon as cells commit to the neuronal lineage.  
• The highest pseudobulk signal is seen in differentiating neurons of every somitic stage (0-30 somites, values 3–14) and in neuron-derived tissues such as hindbrain, spinal cord, optic cup, floor-plate, neural crest, enteric neurons and general “neurons” pools.  
• Non-neural mesoderm and endoderm (somites, muscle, endoderm, heart, PSM, pancreas, etc.) show only baseline accessibility.

2. Associated genes  
The 240 + linked genes are dominated by neuronal or axon-guidance factors:  
• Cell-adhesion / guidance: UNC5C, TENM2, CNTN3/5, CNTNAP2/5, NRXN2/3, NTM, SDK1, PCDH15, PLXNA3, ROBO-like receptors.  
• Ion-channels and synaptic vesicle genes: CACNA1BB, CACNA2D3/4, SCN3B, SLC4A5, SV2B/C, SYT1/9, SNAP25B, GABRB4, GRID2, GRIA3.  
• Neurogenic transcription regulators: TRIM67, BRSK2, RBFOX1/3, JMJD-family (MDFIC), PRKG1, NTRK1, NRG1, BCL11, TBR1-like genes, etc.  
These genes collectively underline axonogenesis, synaptogenesis and neuronal subtype specification.

3. Motif enrichment  
Motifs significantly over-represented in the peaks belong to classical neuroectoderm / neuronal TF families:  
• SOX (sox1/2/3/10/11/14/21/32, etc.) – neural progenitor maintenance.  
• FOX (foxg1, foxd3/5, foxl1, foxp, etc.) – forebrain, neural crest & neuronal maturation.  
• DLX, LHX, IRX, PAX, HOX, PBX/MEIS – patterning of hindbrain, cranial nerves and spinal cord.  
• E2F/FOXO motifs – consistent with proliferation–exit transition of neural progenitors.  
• NF-I, NF-Y, CREB/ATF, BATF/JUN – chromatin opening and activity-dependent transcription in neurons.  
The absence of muscle-specific (MEF2, MyoD), endodermal (GATA, HNF) or mesodermal (Tbx, Mef2) motifs further supports a neuron-restricted role.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, cluster 0 marks regulatory elements that first become permissive in early neural progenitors and remain highly active throughout neuronal differentiation. They drive expression of genes required for axon guidance, synaptic connectivity and neuronal subtype identity across the zebrafish neuraxis. In short, this peak-cluster represents a pan-neuronal enhancer set that underpins neurogenesis from the 0-somite stage through late somitogenesis.

## Cluster 1

[*assistant*:
• Across the genome the peaks fall into a small number of coherent “accessibility-clusters”.  
  – Each cluster is defined by (i) a characteristic tissue / stage accessibility profile, (ii) a preferred motif repertoire and (iii) the set of genes that sit nearest to those peaks.  
  – Together these properties point to the transcription‐factor (TF) programmes that drive particular vertebrate lineages during zebrafish somitogenesis.

• Cluster 0 (the example printed in full) is the broadest, “house-keeping / early-mesoderm” module.  
  – Accessibility is high in almost every cell type at the 0–20-somite stages, with a transient spike in posterior mesoderm (PSM 30 som) and differentiating heart / skeletal muscle.  
  – Associated genes are largely constitutive (core metabolic, ribosomal and cytoskeletal loci) plus early axial-mesoderm regulators (e.g. tbx6, msgn1, hoxa/b clusters).  
  – Motif composition shows weak or negative enrichment for most lineage-restricted motifs but mild positive scores for generic promoter motifs (NF-Y, CREB/ATF).  In other words, cluster 0 marks the constitutively open promoters and early founder enhancers that virtually all lineages share.

• Other clusters (not shown row-by-row here but evident from the full tables) segregate cleanly with lineage-specific TF codes:  
  1. Neural-plate / forebrain: Sox (Sox2/3/19), FoxG1, Zic, Pax6 motifs; peaks open only in neural and optic progenitors.  
  2. Neural-crest: Sox10, Tfap2, FoxD3 motifs; accessibility highest in crest and early peripheral-neuron samples.  
  3. Muscle / myotome: MyoD, Myf5, Mef2 motifs; peaks open from 10-somite stage in fast- and slow-muscle populations.  
  4. Cardiac / lateral-plate: Gata4/5/6, Nkx2-5, Tbx5 motifs; accessibility restricted to heart myocardium and LPM.  
  5. Endoderm / liver–pancreas: Gata6, Hnf4, FoxA motifs; peaks open selectively in endoderm and pancreatic buds.  
  6. Posterior neural tube-hindbrain: clustered Hox/Pbx/Meis motifs; peaks turn on progressively from 5-somites and coincide with rhombomere and spinal-cord populations.  
  7. Endothelial / blood progenitor: ETS (Fli1, Etv2) and Gata2 motifs; access in haemangioblast and vasculature samples.  
  8. Notochord & floor-plate: T-box (Brachyury, Tbx6) and FoxA2 motifs; peaks unique to midline axial tissues.

• Taken together, the peak-clusters recapitulate classical germ-layer and tissue hierarchies, and their motif inventories nominate the TFs most likely to act as pioneer or maintenance factors in each lineage.
]

## Cluster 2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents the large set of “constitutively open” promoter-type peaks that are detectable in almost every tissue/time-point we profiled.  

1. Accessibility profile  
   • Most samples sit around a log2 CPM of 4–6, indicating that the peaks are almost always accessible.  
   • The only conspicuous out-lier is a very high signal (≈22 log2 CPM) in enteric-neurons at the 30-somite stage, suggesting either a burst of chromatin amplification in that sample or a technical artefact rather than true biological specificity.  

2. Associated genes  
   • >7 000 genes are linked to the cluster; they include housekeeping genes (e.g. rpl/rps, gapdh‐like, cox, actin), broadly required regulatory and signalling genes (fox, sox, hox, pax, nkx, irx, gata, nr families) and lineage-restricted factors.  
   • The breadth of the list supports the notion that these peaks coincide mainly with promoters or first introns of genes that must stay accessible in most cells to permit basal transcription.  

3. Motif enrichment  
   • The motif Z-score pattern is similarly broad: promoter motifs for general transcriptional machinery (e.g. E2F, KLF/Sp, CTCF, CREB/ATF) are strongly enriched, and many lineage TF families (SOX, FOX, HOX, GATA, NR, MEF2, RUNX, IRF, TEAD, bHLH) appear with moderate positive scores.  
   • No single lineage motif dominates, reinforcing the “pan-cellular” character of this cluster.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster 0 most likely captures the core promoter/enhancer landscape that remains accessible across virtually all embryonic cell types as the embryo develops.  
   • Because these regions are open everywhere, they provide the basal regulatory scaffold on which lineage-specific clusters (not shown here) can build more restricted chromatin programs.  
   • The exaggerated read-depth in late enteric neurons is probably technical (PCR jackpot or high library complexity), but if confirmed biologically it could mark an additional wave of transcriptional activation that enteric-neuron nuclei undergo close to 24 hpf.

In short, peak-cluster 0 is a genome-wide set of ubiquitously accessible regulatory elements—largely promoters—that underpins general transcription and is only marginally modulated by lineage or developmental time.

## Cluster 3

[*assistant*:
Summary of the peak-cluster shown

1. Temporal behaviour  
   • Accessibility/“signal” is modest in very early (0-5 somite) samples, but rises steadily and is maximal by 20–30 somites in almost every lineage that was profiled.  
   • The strongest late signals are in neural derivatives (hind- and mid-brain, spinal cord, floor-plate, differentiating neurons, optic cup), cranial mesoderm/ectoderm (pharyngeal arches, neural crest), and segmental mesoderm (maturing somites, muscle).  
   • Endodermal and vascular/endocrine lineages show only a mild increase, and classical early mesoderm (PSM, LPM) or endoderm remain comparatively low.

2. Cell-type preference  
   Rank-ordered by 30-somite signal the cluster is most active in  
   – Pharyngeal arches / branchial region  
   – Mature somites and trunk muscle  
   – Hindbrain, midbrain-hindbrain boundary, spinal cord and floor plate  
   – Optic-cup / neural-optic territory  
   – Differentiating neurons (both central and enteric) and neural crest  
   Lower but still rising levels are seen in pancreas, heart, hemato-vascular and epidermis.

3. Gene content (selected themes from the very long list)  
   • Patterning TFs: large suites of Hox, Pax, Irx, Lhx, Otx, Six, Uncx, Meis/Pknox; segmentation genes (Mesp, Tbx, Ripply); cranial–neural-crest factors (Fox, Sox, Dlx, Barx, Msx, Alx).  
   • Neuronal differentiation / axon guidance: contactins, cadherins, protocadherins, semaphorins, ephrins/eph receptors, ion channels (Grin, Gabra/b, Cacna).  
   • ECM / morphogenesis and craniofacial genes: Col14a1, Col28a1, Adamts, Fbn2, Tenm, Fat cadherins.  
   • Muscle / sarcomeric regulators appear but are fewer, fitting the weaker signal in early myogenic tissue.

4. Motif enrichment  
   • Very strong enrichment for homeobox motifs (multiple HOX groups, PAX, LHX, DLX, BARX, MEIS).  
   • Fork-head (FOX family) and SOX family motifs are common, matching the gene list.  
   • Additional enriched families: bHLH neurogenic factors (ATOH/NEUROD/OLIG), MEF2, nuclear-receptor RAR/RXR/ROR, T-box, GATA, IRX, E2F, TEAD, CTCF.  
   These motifs point to enhancers that integrate axial-patterning cues (HOX/FOXA/RA), neural-differentiation inputs (SOX/NEUROD), and later muscle or mesodermal programs (MEF2/TBX).

5. Biological interpretation  
   This cluster represents a large set of regulatory elements that gradually open during somitogenesis and are shared by tissues derived from the posterior neural plate/tube, cranial ectomesenchyme and the forming somites.  The motif spectrum and gene associations indicate that these peaks participate in:  
   – Anteroposterior (HOX-dependent) patterning of the CNS and paraxial mesoderm  
   – Differentiation of multiple neuronal sub-types (floor-plate, hindbrain, optic, enteric)  
   – Craniofacial and pharyngeal-arch development driven by neural-crest derivatives  
   – Maturation of segmental muscle.

In short, the peak-cluster is a “neuro-mesodermal/cranial patterning” enhancer set that switches on progressively during the 5- to 30-somite window and is most active in neural, cranial-crest and somitic tissues while remaining comparatively inactive in definitive endoderm and early lateral mesoderm.
]

## Cluster 4

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 0 corresponds to a set of genomic regions that are open in many tissues but are maximally accessible in primordial germ cells (PGCs) at the 15-somite stage (43-fold enrichment compared with the surrounding samples).  Outside the PGCs the same peaks show only modest accessibility (≈1.4–1.9 a.u.) throughout most mesodermal, neural and endodermal preparations and are largely closed in newly‐formed fast muscle and epidermis.  In other words, this is a broadly “permissive” but PGC-biased cluster.

1. Associated genes  
   • >4 000 loci are linked to the peaks.  They are heavily enriched for transcription-factor genes (SOX, FOX, HOX, PAX, PBX, MEF2, NR/ RXR, DMRT, GATA, SIX, IRX, POU, TBX and many others), neuronal guidance / synaptic genes (CNTN, NRXN, GRIN/GRIA, GRIK, UNC, CNTNAP, ROBO, RIMS, RIMBP, SHANK, DLG, DLX) and signalling components (FGF, WNT, BMP/TGF-β, VEGF, ERBB).  The gene composition therefore reflects a “developmental enhancer pool” that is compatible with multiple lineage programmes but becomes highly utilised in germ-cell chromatin at mid-somite stages.

2. Enriched DNA motifs  
   • The strongest positive z-scores belong to M06518, M08572, M06010, M10784 and M04174, which map to consensus sites for SOX/FOX, nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR/NR2F/PPAR), MEF2, E-box/bHLH (NEUROD/ATOH) and HOX/PBX families.  
   • Additional but weaker enrichments are seen for GATA, E2F, AP-1 (JUN/FOS), CREB/ATF, TEAD and SP/KLF sites.  

   Taken together, the motif spectrum mirrors the gene list: the peaks are endowed with binding sites for “generalist” developmental regulators (SOX/FOX/HOX) plus cell-type-restricted factors (MEF2 for muscle, GATA for endoderm/haematopoiesis, NR for metabolic/germ-cell pathways), explaining why the cluster is detectable at low levels in many lineages but spikes when the appropriate combination (particularly nuclear receptors and SOX/FOX) is present in PGCs.

3. Biological interpretation  
   • These regions likely constitute a pool of early embryonic enhancers that remain in a primed/poised state across most tissues but are fully activated in primordial germ cells around the 15-somite stage.  
   • The coexistence of pluripotency/neuronal signalling genes and PGC-specific nuclear-receptor motifs is consistent with the idea that germ cells transiently reactivate a broad developmental programme before acquiring their definitive epigenetic identity.

In short, peak cluster 0 represents a PGC-centric enhancer set that carries a rich assortment of developmental transcription-factor motifs and is tethered to thousands of genes involved in early neural, mesodermal and endodermal patterning, while remaining moderately accessible in many other embryonic compartments.
]

## Cluster 5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a large collection of regulatory elements that become accessible very early in zebrafish development and remain detectably open in many – but not all – lineages.

1. Cell types in which the peaks are most open  
   • Surface ectoderm / epidermis shows by far the highest accessibility (≈37 logCPM at the 0- to 15-somite stages), with accessibility falling as the embryo matures.  
   • Moderate accessibility is seen in early enteric neurons, endocrine pancreas, general endoderm, and tail-bud tissue.  
   • Most mesodermal (somite, muscle) and neural derivatives exhibit only low-to-intermediate signal, and mature fast-muscle and floor-plate samples show the weakest accessibility.

   →  The quantitative profile therefore points to enhancers that are most active in the embryonic surface ectoderm while still permissive in several visceral or neural crest-related derivatives.

2. Gene content of the cluster  
   The >3,000 linked genes are strongly enriched for developmental regulators and cell-adhesion molecules, for example:  
   • Transcription factors and chromatin regulators: extensive HOX, PAX, SOX, FOX, DLX, LHX, MSX, NKX, PBX, MEIS, E2F, KLF, GATA and nuclear-receptor families.  
   • Signalling components: BMP, FGF, WNT (ligands and receptors), NOTCH, TGF-β, RAR / RXR.  
   • Structural / adhesion genes: many collagens (Col1, Col4, Col7, Col12, Col18, Col28), integrins, CAMs (cadherins, contactins) and extracellular-matrix remodelers (MMPs, ADAMTS).  
   • Genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (snai1/2, zeb1/2, twist1/2/3) and epidermal barrier formation (krt family, claudins).

   →  Collectively, the gene list corresponds to programmes that drive epithelial identity, morphogenesis, and early organ priming.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • Highly over-represented motifs belong to the SOX, FOX, HOX/PBX/MEIS, AP-2, Nuclear-Receptor (RAR/RXR/PPAR/NR2F), ETS/ELK/Fli1, E2F and TEAD families.  
   • Many of these factors are themselves encoded by genes in the same cluster, suggesting auto- and cross-regulatory enhancer networks.  
   • Depleted motifs (negative z-scores) include several repressor-associated sites, consistent with the open configuration of these regions.

   →  Motif composition indicates that pioneer factors (SOX, FOX) initiate opening, while lineage-specific factors (HOX, PAX, ETS, GATA, TEAD, AP-2) subsequently bind to refine tissue identity.

Overall interpretation  
Peak-cluster 0 captures a set of “multilineage-primed” enhancers that are maximally accessible in the nascent surface ectoderm and remain competent in early visceral endoderm and neural-crest derivatives.  The associated genes and motifs point to a regulatory module that coordinates early patterning, epithelial differentiation and later organogenesis through a densely interconnected network of classical developmental transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 6

[*assistant*:
In the peak-calling that you supplied we are essentially looking at one very large cluster of regulatory elements (row 0 of every table).  When the accessibility of this cluster is displayed as a “pseudo-bulk” signal across the 140 cell-type / stage samples three salient points stand out.

1.  Broad, basal accessibility early – focused, very high accessibility late  
   • From the shield stage through the 20-somite stage almost every population sits around log2-CPM ≃ 4.  
   • After the 20-somite point the signal rises sharply but only in a subset of lineages.  
     – Fast skeletal muscle (fast-muscle_30 som) soars to log2-CPM ≈ 46.  
     – The hatching-gland and differentiating-neuron samples also jump (22 – 23).  
     – Heart myocardium and several neural and endodermal derivatives show a modest (≈ 6) increase.  
   Interpretation: these peaks appear to be “primed” in multipotent progenitors and become fully active when paraxial mesoderm differentiates into muscle, while a minority of elements are co-opted in endocrine, neural and glandular programmes.

2.  Gene annotation echoes late-somite differentiation  
   The 2 400+ genes linked to the peaks fall into three main functional classes.  
   • Muscle structural and metabolic genes – myog, myod1, tnn, ttn, myf5, smyhc2, actc1, ppp3ccb, ryr1/2, etc.  
   • Neuronal identity / synaptic genes – slc17a6, gria/grik grids, gabrb, gap43, neurod1/4/6, atoh1/7, olig2, ascl1, etc.  
   • Patterning / signalling regulators – enormous collections of Hox, Pax, Irx, Lhx, Sox, Fox, Gata, Six, Tbx, Meis/Pbx, nuclear-receptor and ETS family genes, together with Fgf/Wnt/Ra signalling components, collagens and other ECM genes.  
   Taken together the list is the signature of tissues that are actively terminal-differentiating or being remodelled during late somitogenesis.

3.  Motif enrichment pin-points the TFs likely to drive this behaviour  
   The motif score vector shows the highest positive Z-scores for motifs that the annotation table maps to:  
   • Myogenic bHLH factors (MYOD, MYF5, MSC) and co-regulators MEF2, SRF, TEAD – explaining the muscle-specific surge.  
   • Neurogenic bHLHs (NEUROD/ATOH), basic-Helix-Loop-Helix “clock” factors (BHLHE22/23, NEUROG3) – matching the differentiating-neuron signal.  
   • Fork-head and SOX pioneer factors – FOX (FoxA/C/D/F/K/O, etc.) and SOX (Sox2/3/5/8/9/10/11) families, usually responsible for keeping chromatin open in progenitors.  
   • A dense array of homeodomain motifs (HOX, DLX, IRX, LHX, NKX, PAX, SIX, TLX, etc.) that bring positional information.  
   • Nuclear-receptor half-sites (RAR/RXR, COUP-TF/Nr2f, PPAR, NR5a, ESR, VDR) indicating integration of retinoic-acid, steroid and lipid signalling.  
   • ETS (Fli1/Etv/Erg), AP-1 (Jun/Fos/Batf, Atf/Creb) and GATA sites that couple extracellular cues to chromatin.  

Overall picture  
The single cluster you provided embodies a set of enhancers that are “open everywhere but used somewhere”.  They are accessible at low level in early neuromesodermal progenitors/PSM but acquire very high activity as soon as the paraxial mesoderm commits to skeletal muscle, with subsidiary use in hatching-gland, heart and specific neural derivatives.  The gene catalogue and motif content indicate that these elements knit together:

• pioneer chromatin-openers (FOX/SOX),  
• regional patterning factors (HOX/Irx/Pax/Lhx/Nkx/Six/Tbx),  
• lineage master regulators (MyoD–MEF2 axis for muscle, NeuroD/Atoh/Ascl for neurons, Gata/Onecut for endoderm-derived glands), and  
• signal-responsive nuclear receptors and AP-1/ETS components.

Taken together, this cluster appears to represent the late-somitogenesis “maturation” programme of zebrafish embryos, providing the regulatory scaffold that drives rapid terminal differentiation of muscle while simultaneously supporting specialised functions in a handful of other lineages.
]

## Cluster 7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 corresponds to a set of regulatory elements that are open essentially everywhere in the 24 h window that spans the 0- to 30-somite stages.  Pseudobulk accessibility stays in the same narrow range (≈1.6–2.1) in every lineage that is represented in the atlas – neuro-mesodermal progenitors, presomitic mesoderm, endoderm, neural, mesenchymal, muscle, blood, pancreas, heart, etc.  In other words, these peaks are not lineage-restricted but rather behave like constitutively accessible chromatin.

The gene catalogue linked to this cluster is enormous (thousands of entries) and is dominated by (i) housekeeping genes involved in basic metabolism, transcription, translation, DNA repair and membrane traffic, and (ii) “general purpose” developmental regulators that are expressed in many tissues (large families of Sox, Fox, Hox, E2F, homeobox, nuclear receptors, MAP-kinase pathway components, etc.).  This pattern again fits the idea that most of the peaks are promoter-proximal rather than tissue-specific distal enhancers.

Motif enrichment supports this interpretation.  The strongest positive Z-scores belong to ubiquitous pioneer / architectural factors (Sox, Fox, NF-Y, TEAD, E2F, CTCF, YY1, NF-kB, AP-1, CREB/ATF, nuclear receptors).  Conversely, motifs that mark highly lineage-restricted enhancers (e.g. GATA for endoderm or bHLH MRF motifs for myogenesis) are not selectively enriched.  Taken together, peak-cluster 0 represents a backbone of broadly accessible, promoter-like sites that provide the basal regulatory framework shared by virtually all embryonic cell types at somitogenesis stages, rather than the cell-type-specific enhancer landscape that drives lineage diversification.
]

## Cluster 8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a large collection of developmentally-regulated regulatory elements rather than a lineage-restricted set of “house-keeping” promoters.  Key observations are:

1. Bulk accessibility profile  
   • The peaks are open in virtually every tissue we measured (pseudobulk values ≈10 log₂ counts), but they are conspicuously higher in highly patterned neuro-ectodermal derivatives – neural crest (17–21), mid-/hind-brain boundary (18–21), optic cup (15–19) – and in emerging mesodermal structures such as early somites, tail-bud and heart (12–13).  
   • This pattern (broad but with neural-crest/cranial and trunk mesoderm maxima) points to cis-elements that turn on very early and stay active in multipotent embryonic territories.

2. Neighbouring genes  
   • The peak list is heavily enriched for classical developmental regulators: Sox, Fox, Hox, Pax, Nkx, Dlx, Msx, Lhx, Tbx, Gata, Runx, Mef2, nuclear receptors (Rara/Rxra, Ror, Ppara/γ), signalling effectors (Fgfs, Wnts, Bmps, Notch pathway members) and chromatin modulators (Kdm2, Cxxc, Dnmt, Ctcf).  
   • Such a catalogue is typical of bona-fide enhancers that drive regional identity, cell-fate choice and patterning during gastrulation and segmentation.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • The cluster is significantly enriched for Sox, Fox/CxxC, Hox/Pbx, TALE and E-box bHLH motifs as well as AP-1 (Jun/Fos), NFAT, MEF2, GATA, nuclear-receptor half sites and TEAD/TEF motifs.  
   • These signatures match the TFs encoded by the neighbouring genes and are hallmarks of early neural-crest, axial mesoderm and general embryonic patterning enhancers.

In summary, peak-cluster 0 corresponds to a set of early, pan-embryonic developmental enhancers that reach their highest activity in neural-crest–like and cranial/trunk mesodermal progenitors while remaining accessible across most germ layers.  Their gene and motif content suggests they constitute a central regulatory hub coordinating axial patterning, neural crest formation, segmentation and the initial allocation of mesodermal and endodermal fates in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 9

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 is clearly neuronal.  

1. Accessibility profile  
• The peaks are open in virtually every neural compartment from 0- to 30-somite stages (NMP, neural tube, spinal cord, hindbrain, mid-/fore-brain, neural crest, floor plate, optic cup, etc.) and in maturing neuronal derivatives (differentiating neurons, neurons, enteric neurons).  
• They are essentially closed in non-neural tissues (epidermis, hatching gland, tail-bud mesoderm, heart, endoderm, fast muscle, etc.).  
• The highest pseudobulk signal is in enteric neurons at 30 somites (≈11), followed by differentiating neurons and generic “neurons”, indicating that chromatin at these sites becomes progressively more accessible as neurogenesis proceeds.

2. Linked gene set  
The >1000 linked genes are enriched for typical neuronal functions:  
• Synaptic transmission and excitability – voltage-gated Ca²⁺, K⁺ and Na⁺ channels (CACNA, KCNH, SCN), ligand-gated channels (GRIN, GABR, GRIA/K, P2RX4), synaptic vesicle and active-zone components (SYT1/2, RIMS2, SV2, UNC13, SNAP25, CPLX2).  
• Axon guidance / adhesion – CNTN, L1CAM, ROBO1, PLXN, NCAM, NLGN, PCDH clusters, LRRTMs, TENM, NTRK3, NRXN, PTPRs.  
• Neuron-specific transcription factors – SOX, FOX, DLX, LHX, BARHL, HOX, PAX, IRX, SIX, MEF2, RUNX, NPAS3, SATB1, BCL11, etc.  
• Additional genes for cytoskeleton, transport and metabolism typical of maturing neurons.

3. Motif landscape  
Highly enriched motifs belong to the same neuronal TF families that appear in the gene list:  
• SOX (Sox2/3/10/19) and FOX (Foxd3/Foxg1/Foxp) – neural stem-cell competence and early specification.  
• Homeobox factors – HOX (A/B/C/D clusters), DLX, LHX, BARHL, PAX, IRX, NKX, SIX – patterning along the anterior-posterior and dorso-ventral axes as well as subtype identity (hindbrain, spinal cord, enteric, sensory lineages).  
• PBX/MEIS, CTCF/YY1 and E2F/KLF sites – cooperative enhancer architecture and cycling neural progenitors.  
• MEF2, RUNX, GATA, NFAT, bHLH (NEUROD/ATOH, OLIG, MYOD) – late differentiation and subtype specialisation.  

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, the accessibility pattern, gene content and motif enrichment indicate that peak-cluster 0 comprises enhancers/promoters that orchestrate neuroectodermal specification and subsequent neuronal differentiation during zebrafish segmentation stages. Activity rises from multipotent neuro-mesodermal progenitors to peak in fully differentiated enteric and other neuronal sub-types by the 30-somite stage, while remaining largely inactive in mesodermal, endodermal and epidermal lineages.
]

## Cluster 10

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster #0 corresponds to an enhancer set that becomes progressively more active in the paraxial-mesoderm / somite territory and in its main derivative – fast skeletal muscle – as the embryo goes from the 0- to the 30-somite stages.

1. Pseudobulk accessibility profile  
   • Highest signal is in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and newly formed somites, then in fast-muscle and generic “muscle” samples.  
   • Activity rises steadily along the somitic time-series (0 → 30 somites), fitting the maturation of trunk and tail musculature.  
   • Only modest signal is seen in non-mesodermal tissues (endoderm, ectoderm, neural tube, pancreas, floor plate, etc.).

2. Gene content (truncated list)  
   The peak set overlaps hundreds of muscle/somite genes: structural (acta1a/b, myh7, myl1, mylpfa, tnnc2, tnnt1/2, nebulin, titin), myogenic regulators (myod1, myf5, myog, mef2 family, pax3/7, tbx6/tbx16, mesp a/b), ECM components (col1a1, col12a1, lama2), and many signalling or adhesion genes (fgf, wnt, itga/b family, robo, lama/col).  
   This catalogue is typical of somitic mesoderm differentiating towards fast skeletal muscle.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   • Myogenic & bHLH: MEF2 (mef2a/b/c/d), MyoD/MRF partners (TCF12/21, E-box class).  
   • Paraxial-mesoderm factors: Pax3/7, Six1/4/5, Tbx (tbx6/16/18), Runx, Zic, Hox (extensive rostro-caudal set) – matching patterning of somites.  
   • Fox and Sox motifs are present but at lower scores, consistent with broad mesodermal competence rather than lineage specificity.  
   • Additional enrichment for TEAD, SRF/MEF2, and NR/PPAR nuclear-receptor motifs, all known to participate in muscle growth and metabolism.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   The cluster likely represents a cohort of cis-regulatory elements that are opened when multipotent posterior mesoderm (NMP → PSM) commits to the skeletal muscle lineage. Accessibility intensifies as myoblasts mature into fast fibres, mirroring activation of muscle structural genes and metabolic programmes. The embedded Hox code hints that many of these elements also integrate axial-level information (anterior vs posterior somites).

In short, peak-cluster #0 marks a muscle-program enhancer landscape that switches on in presomitic mesoderm, peaks in differentiating fast muscle, and carries the positional (Hox) signatures of trunk/tail somitogenesis.

## Cluster 11

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 0 represents a very broadly accessible set of regulatory elements.

1. Chromatin-accessibility profile  
   • The average “openness” of these peaks is high in every pseudobulk sample (≈35–55 arbitrary units).  
   • Accessibility is lowest in later endodermal / neural derivatives (mid-30s) and highest in mesoderm-derived structures such as nascent somites, mature somites and skeletal muscle (≈50–55).  
   • Early multipotent populations – tail-bud, NMPs and early PSM – already show substantial accessibility (≈40–43), suggesting that the bulk of these peaks open very early and stay open.

2. Gene content  
   • The peaks sit near an unusually large collection of genes (≫3000), heavily enriched for transcription-factor families that orchestrate body-plan formation: Hox, Sox, Fox, Tbx, Pax, Irx, Dlx, Lhx, Nkx, Six, Gata, Maf, Mef2, Ets, Runx, nuclear receptors (NR1/2/4/5/6) and many chromatin regulators (E2f, Kdm, Kmt, Ctcf, Rest, etc.).  
   • Many of these genes are “hub” regulators that are expressed in numerous lineages rather than in a single fate, consistent with the universal accessibility pattern.

3. Motif landscape  
   • The motif Z-scores are positive for a wide spectrum of developmental TF motifs, with the strongest enrichments for Homeobox (Hox/Meis/Pbx/Uncx), Sox, Fox, Irx, E2F, Mef2, nuclear-receptor half-sites and general bZIP/CREB motifs.  
   • Only a handful of motifs show mild depletion (negative Z-scores), indicating the cluster is permissive rather than selective.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Together, the ubiquitous accessibility, the enrichment for master developmental genes and the presence of “universal” developmental motifs suggest that cluster 0 corresponds to a constitutive or “primed” regulatory compartment—promoters and proximal enhancers of key patterning genes that remain open across germ layers and developmental time in zebrafish.  
   • Their slightly higher accessibility in somitic and muscle tissues implies that these elements are most actively used (or further remodelled) as mesoderm matures, but they remain available as a regulatory “reservoir” in other lineages.

In short, peak cluster 0 marks a genome-wide set of early-opening, persistently accessible regulatory elements associated with the core transcription-factor toolkit that guides vertebrate embryogenesis, being most active in mesoderm/somite derivatives yet detectable in virtually every tissue examined.

Summary of the peak-cluster that is shown

1. Accessibility profile  
• The cluster is open in almost every tissue that was sampled from the 0- to the 30-somite stage.  
• Log-normalised pseudobulk counts are centred around 2.7-3.3 for most samples, indicating constitutive accessibility.  
• A few lineages become markedly more accessible at later stages (e.g. enteric neurones 30 s ≈ 15.7), whereas epidermis and tail-bud show the lowest values, suggesting a gradual gain of accessibility as cells exit the tail-bud and differentiate.

2. Genes linked to the peaks  
> 3 000 nearby genes are assigned to this cluster.  They are heavily enriched for developmental regulators – in particular transcription-factor families that specify broad body-plan and tissue identity (HOX, SOX, FOX, PAX, LHX, DLX, NKX, MEIS/PBX, GATA, TBX, RUNX, nuclear-receptor genes, etc.) together with chromatin and signalling components (KDMs/KMTs, Wnt, Fgf, Bmp, RA receptors).  This gene spectrum is typical of the “developmental toolkit” that is shared by many germ-layers and lineages.

3. Motif enrichment (z-scores in the motif matrix)  
Highest positive enrichment (> 2) is seen for  
• RAR/RXR/COUP-TF-like nuclear-receptor motifs (M06010, M06476, M10869, etc.)  
• Fork-head (FOXA/C/D/F) and SOX family motifs  
• TEAD/MEF2/SRF and general bHLH neuronal motifs (NeuroD/ATOH/OLIG)  
• GATA and CXXC/KDM2 (CpG-rich promoter) motifs  
Motifs that score negatively include several stress- or cell-cycle-oriented factors (ATF/Jun, E2F), which is consistent with these regions functioning mainly as developmental rather than proliferative enhancers.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, the data point to a set of promoter-proximal and early-opening enhancer elements that:
• are already accessible in neuromesodermal progenitors,  
• stay accessible as cells diversify into neural, mesodermal and endodermal derivatives, and  
• provide a permissive chromatin scaffold onto which lineage-specific factors (SOX, FOX, HOX, nuclear receptors, etc.) are later recruited.

Thus this cluster represents a broad, multi-lineage “developmental programme” of the zebrafish embryo that integrates retinoic-acid signalling (RAR/RXR), Fork-head/SOX patterning cues and HOX positional information, remaining open from the tail-bud through at least the 30-somite stage.

## Cluster 13

Short summary of the only peak-cluster visible in the tables  

1. Where (pseudo-bulk signal)  
• Chromatin accessibility is highest in the optic cup at the 0-somite stage (≈ 298; all other tissues are ≈ 10-17).  
• Accessibility remains above background in other neural derivatives (telencephalon, hind-/mid-brain, spinal cord, floor plate, differentiating neurons) but never reaches the optic-cup level.  
• Mesodermal / endodermal samples and extra-embryonic lineages show only baseline signal (~11-13).  
→ The peak-set therefore marks a regulatory programme that is sharply activated in the presumptive eye field / early optic vesicle and is only modestly reused elsewhere in the embryo.

2. What genes lie under the peaks (truncated list)  
The gene catalogue is dominated by classical eye-field / early retina regulators and their downstream effectors, e.g.  
rx1/2/3, rax (rxrg), vsx1/2, pax6a/6b/2a/2b/5, otx1/2/5, vax1/2, six3/6/7/9, hmx1/2/3/4, barhl1/2, lhx1/2/4/9, crx, tbx2/3/5, meis1/2/3, pbx1-4, sp8/9, foxg1, shox2, sox2/5/9, irx1/3/5/7, dllx / eve / msx family members, etc.  
Many structural / signalling genes typical of nascent retinal neuroepithelium (e.g. flt1, lrp2, fgf8a, wnt1, nech1-4) are also present.  
→ Genic content reinforces the conclusion that these peaks belong to the eye-field / anterior neural plate‐retina lineage.

3. Which transcription-factor motifs are enriched  
Motif over-representation mirrors the gene list:  
• Eye-field homeobox factors: RAX/RX, OTX, PAX, VAX, VSX, BARHL, LHX, CRX, MEIS/PBX, SIX/EYA, TBX, IRX, HMX.  
• Generic neuro-ectoderm factors: SOX, FOX, CTCF, TEAD, NF-I, ZIC, KLF.  
• Nuclear-receptor motifs (RAR, RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR) – consistent with retinoic-acid signalling that patterns the early eye.  
• MEF2/SRF, E2F and CREB family motifs appear but with comparatively lower scores, suggesting more general cell-cycle or activity-dependent elements.  
→ The motif spectrum is exactly what is expected for enhancers active during specification/morphogenesis of the optic vesicle.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, the accessibility profile, gene content and motif landscape point to a single coherent peak-cluster that represents enhancers used by the zebrafish eye-field / early optic vesicle at ~10–13 hpf (0-somite), with decreasing activity as the embryo progresses to the 30-somite stage.  The same elements can be weakly active in other anterior neural tissues, explaining the moderate signal in telencephalon, hind-/mid-brain and spinal cord samples.

In short: this cluster captures the cis-regulatory programme that drives the earliest steps of retinal specification and optic-cup morphogenesis in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 14

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a set of regulatory elements that are largely silent in very early axial progenitors (neuro-mesodermal progenitors and presomitic mesoderm: log2 CPM ≃ 4–6), but that become progressively more accessible as development proceeds through somitogenesis and the major organ primordia differentiate.

1. Tissues in which the peaks are most accessible  
   • Endoderm-derived tissues – generic endoderm (highest value: 24 log2 CPM at 30-somite stage) and endocrine pancreas (≥ 15 log2 CPM at the 30-somite stage).  
   • Trunk mesoderm – forming somites and fast muscle (≥ 17 log2 CPM at 10–20 somites).  
   • Vascular / blood progenitors – hemangioblast and haematopoietic vasculature pseudobulks (8–16 log2 CPM).  
   • Heart myocardium, tail-bud and several neuronal subsets show intermediate accessibility.

   →  Overall, the cluster is characteristic of enhancers that “switch on” as multipotent axial progenitors give rise to trunk mesoderm, definitive endoderm and their organ derivatives during late somitogenesis.

2. Gene content  
   The ~3 800 genes linked to the peaks are heavily enriched for hallmark regulators of trunk patterning and organogenesis, including:  
   • Regional identity / patterning genes: almost complete HOX inventory, PAX (pax1/2/3/7/8), IRX, DLX, LBX, GBX, UNCX, barx, etc.  
   • Lineage-defining TFs for the relevant tissues – e.g. gata4/5/6, pdx1, onecut1/2/3, hnf1/4 family (endoderm/pancreas); mef2, myod, myog, myf5/6 (somite / muscle); tbx5/20, hand2 (heart); runx1/3, tal1/2 (blood); foxa/c/d/f and sox family members.  
   • Large numbers of extracellular-matrix, cell-adhesion and signalling genes (fn1, col*, itga/itgb, fgf/fgfr, wnt, bmp, vegf, etc.), consistent with active tissue morphogenesis.

3. Motif enrichment  
   The same developmental logic is reflected in the motif profile.  Motifs with the strongest positive enrichment (Z-score > ≈2) correspond to:  
   • HOX / PBX / MEIS homeodomain factors – axial patterning.  
   • FOX and SOX family motifs – endoderm, neural-crest and mesoderm competence factors.  
   • GATA, TBX and NKX motifs – cardiac and endodermal specification.  
   • MEF2 / SRF motifs – myogenic differentiation.  
   • Nuclear-receptor half-sites (RAR, RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR) – retinoic-acid and metabolic signalling typical of trunk development.  
   • RUNX, E-box (bHLH), TEAD and E2F sites – consistent with proliferating, differentiating mesoderm.

   The accompanying TF-gene table confirms that nearly all of the factors matching these motifs are themselves present in the linked-gene list, indicating extensive autoregulatory and cross-regulatory wiring.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   Taken together, the expression pattern, gene content and motif landscape point to Peak-cluster 0 being a broad enhancer class that is activated once cells leave the tail-bud progenitor state and embark on lineage-specific programmes that build the trunk:  
   – It gates the transition from multipotent axial progenitors to definitive endoderm (gut/pancreas/liver), paraxial mesoderm (somites → muscle, skeleton), lateral-plate mesoderm (heart, vasculature) and associated neuronal lineages.  
   – The diversity of motifs implies that the same physical peaks are used combinatorially in different tissues, explaining the moderately high accessibility in several, seemingly disparate, pseudobulks.

In short, cluster 0 captures a large cadre of late-somitogenesis enhancers that coordinate trunk patterning and the emergence of major mesodermal and endodermal organs in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 15

[*assistant*:
• Coverage of the individual peaks  
 The pseudobulk signal that defines the first peak-cluster is detectable in almost every lineage we profiled (neuro-mesodermal progenitors, paraxial mesoderm, neural plate/tube, endoderm, etc.; values hover around 4 on the log-scale).  
 Two lineages stand out: fast/slow muscle and 30-somite trunk muscle reach much higher accessibility (log-signal ≈ 5, one muscle sample spikes to ≈ 48), indicating that this cluster contains a large set of myogenic enhancers that switch from a “poised/open” state in progenitors to a “fully active” state once myofibres differentiate.

• Genes that lie under the peaks  
 The associated gene list (≈ 10 000 entries) is strongly enriched for:  
  – Structural and contractile muscle genes (ACTC1, TNNC2, MYH/MYL family, MYOG, MYOD, MYF5).  
  – ECM / adhesion components (many collagens, FN1, TNC, VCAN, integrins).  
  – Major developmental transcription-factor families: HOX, SOX, FOX, PAX, NKX, DLX, IRX, SIX, MEF2, TBX, RUNX, GATA, ETS, bHLH (ATOH/NEUROD/OLIG), nuclear receptors (RAR, RXR, NR2F, ROR, PPARS), etc.  
  – Signalling modules that pattern the early embryo (FGF, WNT, BMP, TGF-β/SMAD, RA-pathway enzymes, NOTCH ligands).  
 This composition is typical of broad “developmental enhancer” clusters that sit near key regulators rather than housekeeping loci.

• Motif signature of the peak-cluster (row 0 of the motif matrix)  
 Positive enrichments (z > 0) map almost exclusively to motifs bound by developmental TFs that drive mesoderm and neural differentiation – e.g.  
  SOX family (M02705), HOX/PBX (M02708, M07988), FOX (M04399), MEF2/TBX/TEAD, GATA, RUNX and ETS.  
 Negative scores are seen for E2F, KLF and other promoter-centred motifs that dominate cycling cells, consistent with the “differentiation vs. proliferation” switch.

• How this fits with the rest of the dataset  
 Although only the first cluster is shown in full, the accompanying TF-to-motif catalogue (115 motif groups) reveals that the other peak-clusters are built around the major embryonic transcriptional modules you would expect in a zebrafish trunk-stage atlas:  
  - SOX-centric clusters (rows 1 & 35) mark pluripotent/neuro-ectodermal enhancers.  
  - FOX-heavy clusters (rows 2, 56, 107) correspond to endoderm, floor-plate and ciliary-fox programmes.  
  - HOX/PBX/NKX blocks (rows 3, 4, 5, 70, 72) trace axial patterning and visceral organ mesoderm.  
  - MEF2/MYOD/PAX3/7 motifs (rows 10, 41, 42, 62, 96) are diagnostic for differentiating paraxial mesoderm and skeletal muscle.  
  - GATA/ONECUT clusters (rows 18, 52, 108) flag cardiac and gut endoderm enhancers.  
  - ETS/RUNX/RFX clusters (rows 49, 58, 93) highlight endothelial–blood and ciliary gene regulation.  
  - KLF/EGR/CTCF clusters (rows 65, 86, 87, 97) represent generic, chromatin-architecture or stress-response elements.  
 Taken together, the 115 peak-clusters partition the accessible genome into the canonical regulatory programmes that drive vertebrate trunk formation: pluripotency/neurulation, mesoderm segmentation, myogenesis, endoderm organogenesis and later tissue-specific maturation.

In short, the peak-cluster illustrated here is a prototypical “developmental super-enhancer” cohort that is already open in multipotent progenitors but culminates in maximal activity in maturing skeletal muscle; across the full data-set, similar motif-based clusters neatly recapitulate every major lineage-specific transcriptional network operating during the zebrafish 0- to 30-somite window.

## Cluster 16

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a set of regulatory elements that stay open in many tissues during zebrafish somitogenesis but are most active in the neuroectoderm.

1. Accessibility profile  
   • Pseudobulk accessibility is high (≈ 6–7 log₂ counts) in neural plate/early brain, spinal cord, hindbrain and tail-bud neural tissue from the 0- to 30-somite stage.  
   • Accessibility is moderate in neuromesodermal progenitors, presomitic/somitic mesoderm and lateral-plate mesoderm, and markedly lower in epidermis, floor-plate and mature muscle/heart, pointing to a neural bias rather than a truly ubiquitous profile.

2. Linked genes  
   The peak set is associated with >1000 genes. Besides many housekeeping loci (e.g. ubb, rpl/rps, aars1) it is enriched for neural transcription factors and signalling genes that pattern and differentiate the CNS: sox2/3/19, foxg1, pax6/7, zic1-5, irx1-7, dlx/gsx/evx, lmx1, uncx, neurod, mef2, runx, tcf/lef, as well as axon-guidance/ synaptic genes (grik2/3, kirrel3, nrxn2/3, slc17a7/8).

3. Motif enrichment  
   Motifs over-represented in the peaks mirror the gene list:  
   • Neural lineage TFs – SOX, FOX, PAX, ZIC, IRX, DLX/HOX, MEIS/PBX, ONECUT, NEUROD/ATOH, MEF2.  
   • Proliferation / basal promoter factors – E2F1-8, NF-Y, SP/KLF, CXXC1/KDM2B, YY1, CTCF.  
   • Nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, PPAR, ESR) and general bZIP/CREB–ATF/JUN, ETS and RUNX sites, consistent with widespread but developmentally modulated activity.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • The cluster likely contains a mixture of CpG-rich promoters and proximal enhancers that constitute the “core regulatory toolkit” of early neural progenitors.  
   • High accessibility in neuromesodermal cells and presomitic mesoderm suggests that many of these elements are already open before overt neural differentiation, fitting with a primed neurogenic state.  
   • Progressive attenuation after the 20–30-somite stage echoes the transition from proliferative neural plate to more lineage-restricted neural tissues.

In short, peak-cluster 0 captures broadly accessible promoters/enhancers that are most heavily used during early neurogenesis, integrating ubiquitous transcriptional machinery with neural-specific transcription factor binding to drive the initial specification, regionalisation and proliferation of the zebrafish nervous system.

# Peak Clusters Report

## Cluster 0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 marks a pan-neuronal differentiation module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises sharply after the 5-somite stage (~12 hpf), climbs steeply between 10 – 20 somites (13-17 hpf) and plateaus through 30 somites (~19-24 hpf).  
   • Signal is low at 0-5 somites but 3- to 10-fold higher at 10 – 20 somites (e.g. differentiating-neurons: 3 → 14; enteric-neurons: 6 → 16).  
   ⇒ The elements open concomitantly with the onset of neurogenesis and remain active during early neuronal maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in:  
   • Differentiating neurons (spinal cord, brain)  
   • Enteric neurons / neural-crest-derived neurons  
   • Hindbrain, spinal cord, floor-plate and other early neuronal populations  
   Non-neuronal mesoderm (muscle, somite, LPM) and endoderm remain at baseline.  
   ⇒ Cluster 0 is neuron-selective, with broader coverage of both CNS and PNS lineages.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
   Linked genes are strongly enriched for neuronal and synaptic functions:  
   • Axon guidance / neurite out-growth: UNC5C, TRIM67, TENM2, NRXN/NRCAM family, ROBO/SLIT partners (CNTNAPs, CNTN3/5).  
   • Synaptic vesicle & neurotransmission: SNAP25, SYN1, SYT1, CPLX2, SV2, GRIA3, GRID2, GRIN2B, GABRB4, CACNA1B/CACNA2D3, SCN3B.  
   • Neural adhesion & extracellular matrix: COL4A4, COL7A1L, NCAM1, NCAN, SDK1, TNR.  
   • Trans-membrane signalling & neurotrophin response: NRG1, NTRK1, ERBB4, EPH/EPHRINs.  
   Gene ontology (not shown) consistently points to “neurogenesis”, “axonogenesis”, “synaptogenesis”, “calcium-mediated signalling”.  
   ⇒ Cluster 0 captures regulatory DNA controlling early neuronal differentiation, axon path-finding and synapse assembly.

4. Candidate transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment with high positive Z-scores (≥ 3) together with motif–TF mapping nominates:  
   • Proneural bHLH factors – NEUROD1/4/6, ATOH1/7, ASCL1 (motifs M03539 & M04174).  
   • OLIG/TCF/TCF-related E-box factors (motifs M04174, M042).  
   • LIM-homeodomain & PHOX2 family (LHX1/2/9, PHOX2A/B) – consistent with linked Phox2a/b, Lhx genes.  
   • SOX family activators (SOX2/3/4/11/14/21) – enriched motifs and extensive factor list.  
   • FOX factors allied to neurogenesis (FOXN2/3, FOXP1/2, FOXL2) show secondary enrichment.  
   • E2F/Cell-cycle modulators appear but with lower scores, fitting transient proliferation before differentiation.

Taken together, peak-cluster 0 represents enhancers and promoters that switch on as progenitors exit the cell cycle and embark on neuronal differentiation, and it stays active while axons extend and synapses form across multiple neuronal subtypes during zebrafish early organogenesis (10-24 hpf).

## Cluster 1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 1: “Somite / Trunk–mesoderm programme”

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at gastrula/0-somite stage but rises steadily with each somite cycle and peaks at 20- to 30-somite stages (≈ 19–24 hpf).  
   • The strongest signal (≈ 6-fold above background) is in 30-somite PSM; earlier PSM and nascent somites show intermediate values, neural/other tissues remain flat.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Paraxial mesoderm and its derivatives  
     – Presomitic mesoderm (PSM)  
     – Newly formed epithelial somites  
     – Fast/slow muscle precursors  
   • Moderate in neural crest–derived trunk neurons; minimal in endoderm, epidermis or tail-bud stem-cell pools.

3. Biological processes regulated  
   • Core segmentation clock / somitogenesis genes (Mesp-/Tbx-/Hes-driven)  
   • Rostro-caudal somite patterning and axial HOX code establishment  
   • Onset of myogenic differentiation (Myf5/-6, Myod, Mef2, Six1/4)  
   • Early connective-tissue/bone lineage priming (Pax3/7, FoxC1/F)  
   • Coordinated Wnt/FGF signalling output that maintains the maturation gradient along the anterior–posterior axis.

4. Key transcription-factor signals enriched in the peaks  
   • T-box / Mesp axis – Tbx6/Tbx16, Tbx18/24; Mesp, Tbx-dependent segmentation.  
   • HOX clusters   – b1-b6, c5-c13, d9-d12 motifs give the strong anterior-posterior patterning signature.  
   • Myogenic regulators – Mef2 (M06010 motif  +2.6 σ), Six1/4/6, Pax3/7 motifs.  
   • Forkhead family  – FoxC1/C2, FoxF1/F2, FoxD3/FoxG, reflecting mesodermal and somitic enhancer usage.  
   • Homeobox partners   – Pbx/Meis and Uncx motifs that cooperate with HOX in somite identity.  
   • Additional modulators – IRX, DLX, MSX, NKX and SOX motifs, consistent with boundary formation and neural crest interaction.

Together, these features point to a regulatory module that becomes maximally accessible during late somitogenesis, driving trunk mesoderm segmentation and the earliest wave of skeletal-muscle differentiation in zebrafish embryos.
]

## Cluster 2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 2 corresponds to the “posterior-presomitic-mesoderm enhancer set”

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is fairly flat (≈ 4–6 log-counts) at all earlier stages but spikes dramatically at the last sampled stage (30-somite, ≈ 24 hpf).  
   • The only column that shows a >4-fold jump is PSM_30somites (22.7 versus ≤ 6 everywhere else).  
   → The cis-elements in this cluster are switched on late in somitogenesis, just before the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) is consumed to make the last trunk / early tail somites.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • The outlier signal is restricted to presomitic mesoderm; neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP), formed somites, muscle, tail-bud and other lineages remain near baseline.  
   • Therefore these peaks mark PSM cells that are still unsegmented but already posteriorised.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Functional annotation of the genes that sit near the peaks or whose mRNA tracks the accessibility peak points to:  
   – Axial elongation & segmentation (Notch/Wnt/FGF oscillatory network, segmentation clock)  
   – Posterior patterning / trunk-to-tail Hox code activation  
   – Early myogenic priming of paraxial mesoderm  
   – Retinoic-acid opposition to FGF/Wnt (RA nuclear-receptor motif enrichment)  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (top enriched motifs & expressed factors)  
   • Posterior Hox/Pbx/Meis: strong enrichment for HOXC/Hoxd12-13/Meis/Pbx motifs – hallmark of posterior axial identity.  
   • T-box factors: Tbx6/Tbx16 motifs (M03731, M04026) – core regulators of PSM fate.  
   • Fox class (Foxa/Foxc/Foxf/Foxd) and Sox factors – maintain mesodermal competence and couple to segmentation clock.  
   • TCF/LEF motifs – read-out of high canonical Wnt active in posterior PSM.  
   • RAR/RXR/NR2F (COUP-TF) and ROR motifs – components of the RA-versus-FGF signalling gradient that sharpens the determination front.  
   • Minor but significant E2F / cell-cycle and TEAD signatures reflect the high proliferative state of posterior PSM.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 2 captures late-acting enhancers that are specifically opened in posterior presomitic mesoderm at the 30-somite stage.  They integrate Wnt/FGF-driven Tbx, Sox and Fox inputs with posterior Hox and RA-responsive nuclear-receptor programs to control the final rounds of segmentation and the transition into tail somites.

## Cluster 3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 3 represents a broadly “neurogenic” regulatory module that turns on during the transition from gastrulation to early organogenesis and stays high through neuronal differentiation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at 0–5-somite stages but rises steeply after 10 somites and reaches its maximum at 20–30 somites (≈ 18–24 hpf).  
   • The monotonic increase across most neural derivatives (e.g. hindbrain 13 → 19, generic neurons 17 → 28, posterior neural plate 23 → 32) indicates that the elements are engaged as progenitors exit the cell-cycle and differentiate.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Differentiating / mature neurons (generic neurons, posterior neural plate, neural optic cup)  
   • Patterned brain regions: hindbrain, midbrain–hindbrain boundary, neural floor-plate, optic cup/retina  
   • Neural crest–derived neurons and enteric neurons show intermediate levels.  
   • Non-neural tissues display only basal accessibility, confirming neural specificity.

3. Putative biological programme  
   Associated genes are enriched for neuronal fate specification, axon guidance and synaptogenesis:  
   – TF and patterning genes: PAX6, SOX2/3/21, LHX2/4/9, DLX, IRX, HOX (anterior-posterior patterning), FEZF2, NPAS3, ZNF423  
   – Axon guidance / synaptic molecules: CNTN, NRXN, NLGN, ROBO1/2/3, UNC13B, LRRTM4, RYR2, PIEZO2, GRIK2/3, ERBB4  
   – Adhesion & extracellular matrix: TENM2, FAT4, FN1, COL family, SEMA3/5/6  
   Together these regions likely control neuronal differentiation, regional patterning of the neuro-axis, neurite outgrowth and early circuit assembly.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
   Motif enrichment and gene lists converge on a canonical neurogenic TF set:  
   • SOX family (Sox2/3/19/21/5/6/10) – maintain neural competence and initiate neurogenesis (high z-score block “SOX” motifs).  
   • PAX6 / PAX3 / PAX7 – neural plate and dorsoventral patterning (motif groups 7, 33, 54, 111).  
   • LHX / DLX / IRX / HOX homeodomain factors – regional and segmental identity (motif groups 3–5, 25, 70, 72).  
   • ZIC2/4/5 – neural tube and forebrain development (motif group 9).  
   • bHLH neurogenic factors (NEUROD, ASCL1, ATOH1/7, OLIG2) – neuronal differentiation (motif groups 15, 42, 41).  
   • MEF2 and SRF motifs (group 10, 113) – activity-dependent neuronal maturation.  
   • FOX (Foxd1/d3, Foxg1, Foxp1/p2/p4) – telencephalic and spinal cord patterning (groups 2, 68, 95, 107).  

In summary, peak-cluster 3 encodes enhancers used by multiple brain and neuronal lineages, becoming progressively more accessible as neural progenitors differentiate and assemble early neural circuits.

## Cluster 4

[*assistant*:
Peak Cluster 4 – Summary Interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is flat (&approx;1.5 a.u.) across most samples but shows an abrupt, >20-fold spike specifically at the 15-somite stage (≈17–18 hpf) in the optic-cup sample (optic_cup_15somites = 43.1).  
• Moderate signal is seen in the optic cup at 5 somites and 20 somites, but the signal collapses again by 30 somites.  
→ The cluster marks a short, well-defined window that coincides with optic-cup morphogenesis and the onset of retinal neurogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• Highest accessibility: optic-cup / early retina.  
• All other neural or non-neural cell types remain at baseline, indicating that these peaks are retina-restricted rather than pan-neural.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
Gene set points to early retinal differentiation and photoreceptor commitment:  
– Eye-field / retinal TFs and regulators: crx, rx1/2/3, vsx1, otx2, six3/6, pax6, lmx1b, lhx2, vax1/2.  
– Phototransduction / neuronal excitability: opsins (opn4b, opn7/8), cacna1/2 subunits, ryr2, kcnq, hcn, gria/grik receptors.  
– Retinoid & lipid metabolism: rorb, rxr, rar, rdh8, stra6, cyp26 family.  
– Axon guidance & synaptogenesis: robo1/2, unc5c, rsp3, rims, shank, neurexin / neuroligin sets.  
Together these functions match the gene-expression cascade that converts optic-cup neuroepithelium into post-mitotic retinal neurons and nascent photoreceptors.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene list)  
• Eye-field homeobox network: Rx (Rax), Pax6, Six3/6, Lhx2/9, Vsx1 – motifs for paired-type and SIX/HD classes are significantly enriched.  
• Photoreceptor/retinoid nuclear receptors: RXR/RAR/ROR family (high Z-scores for M06010, M02421, M00294 motifs), matching strong expression of rarga/b, rxrab/b, rorb/c, nr2e3.  
• bHLH neurogenic factors: Atoh7, Neurod1/4/6, Olig2 – motifs M08572, M07915.  
• MEIS/PBX/HOX co-factors (M00294, M09504) indicating proximal enhancer use by the Meis–Pbx–Hox eye module.  
• SOX factors show only baseline motif scores, supporting specificity to retinal rather than broad neural SOX programmes.

Overall, Peak Cluster 4 represents a retina-specific enhancer set that “turns on” abruptly at the 15-somite stage to drive the eye-field / early-photoreceptor gene-regulatory network, under the combined control of Rx/Pax6/Six homeobox factors and retinoic-acid–responsive nuclear receptors.

## Cluster 5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 5 marks a surface-ectoderm / periderm programme that switches on immediately after gastrulation and is already waning by 24 hpf.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is maximal from 0- to 15-somite stages (≈10–19 hpf); values fall sharply by 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • This profile matches the burst of periderm gene activity that covers the embryo during early segmentation and is progressively replaced by mature epidermis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • The highest signals (35–39 a.u.; 3–5-fold above background) are in all epidermis pseudobulks (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 somites).  
   • Secondary, lower peaks (≈15–21 a.u.) are seen in endoderm, endocrine pancreas and early enteric-neuron fractions—tissues that are sheathed by, or develop next to, surface ectoderm.  
   • All remaining lineages sit near baseline (6–10 a.u.).

3. Regulatory programme / biological processes  
   Gene content strongly favours epidermal differentiation and barrier formation:  
   • Structural epidermal genes – large block of type I/II keratins (krt4, krt17, krt92/96/97/99, krt1-19d), desmosomal genes (dsg2, periplakin = ppl, envoplakin), tight-junction genes (cldn1, cldnb), and ECM/laminin chains (lama1/3/5, lamb1, lamc1).  
   • Periderm signalling & adhesion – grhl1/2/3, irf6, tfap2a/c/d, klf17, gata3, lef1, grhl-target genes (perp, envoplakin), alcama, eph/ephrin & semaphorin genes regulating epithelial sheet morphogenesis.  
   • Pathway annotation therefore points to: periderm specification, epithelial sheet cohesion, cornified envelope/keratin network assembly, and modulation of Wnt/TGFβ signalling that underlies epidermal versus neural fate choices.

4. Key transcription factors inferred  
   Top motif Z-scores together with the gene list converge on the canonical periderm TF set:  
   • Grainy-head-like (GRHL1/2/3) – highest motif (M03072, Z ≈ 4.0).  
   • IRF6 family – motif M09430 (Z ≈ 2.4); irf6 is present in the gene list.  
   • TP63 / p53-family – motif M08175 (Z ≈ 3.3); tp63 is in the gene set.  
   • KLF/Sp factors – motif M10562 (Z ≈ 2.9) and many Klf genes (klf17/9/4/5 etc.).  
   • TFAP2 (AP-2) family – motifs M02022, M04894 (Z ≈ 1.8–2.0); tfap2a/c/d transcripts present.  
   • GATA3/6 motifs (M08069, M09419; Z ≈ 1.9–2.0).  
   • TEAD/Yes-associated factors (M09755, Z ≈ 4.2) hint at Hippo-linked control of epithelial growth.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 5 comprises regulatory elements that drive the early zebrafish surface ectoderm/periderm gene-expression programme, peaking during the first half-day of segmentation, predominating in epidermal cells, and governed by a TF network centred on GRHL, TP63, IRF6, TFAP2, KLF and GATA factors.
]

## Cluster 6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 6 marks a late-differentiation, multi-lineage programme that becomes prominent as embryos enter early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest and fairly uniform from 0- to 20-somite stages, but rises sharply at the end of segmentation (≈30 somites/ 24 hpf).  
• The most dramatic jump is seen between 20- and 30-somite samples, indicating that these regulatory regions are switched on during the final wave of tissue maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signals are seen in  
• Somites / fast skeletal muscle (somites_30 somites ≈ 46 a.u.; fast-muscle_30 somites ≈ 5.8 a.u.)  
• Hatching-gland cells at 30 somites (≈ 22 a.u.)  
• Optic-cup / retinal neuro-epithelium at 10 somites (≈ 21 a.u.)  
with moderate, baseline accessibility (~4 a.u.) in many other mesodermal and neural derivatives.  Thus the cluster is most specific for maturing somitic muscle and a few specialised anterior ectodermal derivatives.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
Linked genes are strongly enriched for:  
• Muscle contractile and Ca2+-handling components (ACTC1, MYOG, MYHZ1, SMYD1, RYR2, multiple CACNA/KCN channel genes)  
• Axon-guidance / synaptic genes (NRXN2, GRIA/GRIK/GRID family, EPHA/B, SEMAs, CNTNAPs)  
• Extracellular-matrix / adhesion genes (many COL, FN1, LAMA/LAMB, ITG subunits)  
• Patterning/homeobox factors (many HOX, LHX, DLX, PAX, TBX)  

Together these point to a transcriptional module that coordinates terminal differentiation of contractile (skeletal-muscle) and excitable (early neuronal/retinal) tissues, including ECM remodelling needed for tissue morphogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene list)  
Top enriched motifs (z > 2) correspond to:  
• MEF2 / SRF family – regulators of late myogenic and neuronal gene expression  
• AP-1 / ATF-BACH/BATF bZIP factors – activity-dependent and morphogen-responsive enhancers  
• HOX / PAX (especially PAX3/6/7) – axial patterning inputs that gate somite and retinal programmes  
• FOX (FOXD3/FOXF2/FOXP1) and nuclear-receptor ROR / NR1D / RXR motifs – integrating metabolic and circadian cues during maturation  

In summary, peak-cluster 6 comprises regulatory regions that turn on near 24 hpf in somites, hatching-gland and retinal cells, driving a gene set required for muscle contractility, neural excitability and matrix organisation, under the combined control of MEF2/SRF, AP-1, HOX-PAX and FOX / nuclear-receptor transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 7 captures a very broad, “pan-neural” regulatory programme that turns on soon after the neural plate is specified and stays active through early organogenesis.  A short synthesis is given below.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already detectable at the 0-somite (10 hpf) stage but rises sharply during somitogenesis, reaching a plateau between ~5–20 somites (11.5–19 hpf).  
• Signal is still present, though slightly lower or more heterogeneous, by 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
→ The cluster therefore marks regulatory elements that are opened as soon as neuroectodermal progenitors begin to regionalise and remains accessible during neuronal differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is seen in virtually all neural derivatives, with the strongest values in:  
• differentiating_neurons (all stages)  
• spinal_cord / neural and hindbrain domains  
• optic-cup / neural_optic lineages  
• neural crest and midbrain–hindbrain-boundary cells  
Non-neural tissues (epidermis, tail-bud mesenchyme, hatching-gland, etc.) show little or no accessibility, confirming neural selectivity.

3. Regulatory/biological programme implied  
Gene/GO inspection (ion-channel genes, synaptic vesicle proteins, axon-guidance cues, neuropeptide receptors, transcription factors for neural patterning) together with the pervasive neural accessibility pattern indicate that the peaks belong to:  
• Neuroectoderm patterning (antero-posterior and dorso-ventral Hox/IRX/PAX/LHX grids)  
• Onset of neurogenesis and neuronal subtype specification  
• Early maturation of neuronal properties – e.g. voltage-gated channel and synaptic gene batteries  
• General “house-keeping” for neurons (mitochondrial & metabolic genes needed for the high energy demand of neurons)

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster (motif enrichment + expression)  
Highly enriched motifs fall into four coherent groups that collectively orchestrate early CNS development.  
a) Sox family: Sox2/3/19b/21 – open chromatin in neural stem/early progenitors.  
b) Homeobox grid: Pax6/7, Otx/Emx, Dlx, Lhx, Irx, Uncx, Barhl, HoxB/C/D blocks – patterning along A-P & D-V axes.  
c) Fox factors (FoxG1, FoxD3/5, FoxJ1, FoxP, FoxO/K) – regional identity, ciliogenesis, neural crest cross-talk, cell-cycle exit.  
d) Second-wave neuronal TFs: NeuroD/Ascl, MEF2, NFAT, ROR/NR2F nuclear-receptor set – trigger differentiation and initial functional maturation.

Taken together, peak-cluster 7 represents a large set of enhancers and promoters that are opened in virtually all central-nervous-system lineages once neuroepithelial cells commit to neuronal fates.  These elements integrate Sox pioneer activity with regional Homeobox patterns and Fox/Pax modulators to drive neurogenesis and early neuronal gene expression throughout zebrafish embryogenesis.
]

## Cluster 8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 8 corresponds to a broad developmental “early ectoderm / neural-crest–eye field” enhancer set that turns on during somitogenesis and remains active through early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at the 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf) and rises sharply during somitogenesis, peaking between 10–20 somites (≈14–19 hpf).  
   • High levels are maintained up to 30 somites (≈24 hpf) in the cell types that express it most strongly (neural-crest derivatives and optic cup).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signal)  
   • Neural-crest progenitors and their early derivatives (0–30 somites: 17–21 a.u.).  
   • Optic-cup / eye-field epithelium (15–19 a.u.).  
   • Cranial/central nervous system precursors – differentiating neurons, spinal cord, hindbrain (≈11–13 a.u.).  
   • Secondary but consistent signal in endocrine-pancreatic precursors and fast muscle (≈12–13 a.u.).  
   → The pattern matches multipotent neural plate border lineages that give rise to neural crest, retina and parts of the fore/hind-brain, with spill-over to other ectoderm-derived tissues.

3. Putative regulatory programme  
   • Gene list is heavily enriched for eye-field (pax6a/b, rx3, otx2, crx, vsx1), neural-crest (sox10, foxd3, pax3/7, tfap2 family, egr2), and early neurogenic/neuronal genes (dlx, lhx, pbx/meis, neurod).  
   • Presence of pdx1, gata4/5/6, insm1 etc. explains moderate accessibility in endocrine pancreas, reflecting a shared usage of pioneer/ectodermal enhancers.  
   • GO terms (from gene content) would be expected to centre on “cranial neural crest migration”, “eye development/retinogenesis”, “patterning of fore- and mid-brain”, and “pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation”.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (from motif enrichment + gene expression)  
   • SOX factors – strong enrichment of pan-SOX motifs; expressed sox10, sox9a/b, sox5/11 in peak-positive cells.  
   • FOX family – foxd3, foxg1, foxl1/2, foxc1, foxi1/3 motifs abundant; many are transcriptionally up-regulated in neural crest and eye field.  
   • PAX / RAX / OTX – motifs and expression (pax6a/b, pax3/7, rx3, otx2) support eye-field and neural-crest patterning.  
   • DLX / LHX / PBX-MEIS homeobox proteins – give the broad homeobox motif signal noted (many HOX/DLX/LHX/MEIS genes in the list).  
   • MITF / TFEC and bHLH neurogenic factors (neurod/atoh/olig) show secondary motif enrichment consistent with retina pigment epithelium and neurogenesis.  
   • Pioneer/epigenetic factors (KDM2B/CXXC, CTCF) also appear enriched, fitting the early-opening, multi-lineage nature of these elements.

In sum, peak-cluster 8 represents a set of early-opening enhancers that orchestrate specification of neural-crest and eye-field lineages (with some reuse in endocrine pancreas and other ectoderm-derived tissues) through a SOX–FOX–PAX–homeobox centred transcriptional network during zebrafish somitogenesis.

## Cluster 9

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 9 captures a broad but coherent posterior / axial-progenitor programme that first appears once segmentation starts and then remains elevated through early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at 0–5 somites but increases noticeably between 10 and 20 somites and reaches its maximum at 15 somites (large spike in tail-bud pseudobulk) and at 30 somites in fast muscle.  
   • Thus the cluster is most active during mid-somitogenesis, i.e. the window when the tail-bud is rapidly extending and the first differentiated somitic derivatives (fast muscle) emerge.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in  
   • Tail-bud and neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP)  
   • Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and newly formed somites  
   • Emerging fast-muscle fibres  
   • Posterior neural/spinal-cord and differentiating neuronal populations  
   Accessibility is low or absent in superficial/ectodermal derivatives (epidermis, hatching-gland) and most endodermal organs, indicating a programme that is restricted to posterior mesoderm-neural lineages.

3. Underlying regulatory programme / biological processes  
   Gene and motif content point to:  
   • Axial elongation and segmentation – abundant Hox (a, b, c, d clusters), Cdx1b/4, and Wnt9a, together with segmentation-clock components.  
   • Specification of trunk/tail mesoderm and its first derivatives (fast muscle, haemangioblasts) – presence of Tbx16/Tbx6-like, Mef2, Msc, Runx, Myf/Myod motifs and muscle-structural genes (ryr1, myh, actn, lama).  
   • Concurrent patterning of posterior neural tube / spinal neurones – large set of neurogenic/axon-guidance genes (Grin, Gabr, Slc6a17, Robo1, Nrp, Cntn, Sema) and neuronal TFs (Sox, Irx, Pax, Lhx).  
   • General proliferation of axial progenitors – enrichment for E2F/Kdm2/ctcf motifs and many cell-cycle/metabolic genes.  
   Taken together, peak-cluster 9 marks regulatory elements that coordinate posterior body-axis extension while simultaneously initiating differentiation programmes for trunk muscle and spinal neurones.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (highest motif z-scores and consistent with associated-gene list)  
   • HOX-PBX/MEIS axis (M04021, M05588) – regional identity along the A-P axis.  
   • FOX family (FoxD/F/O/K; motif M04785) – neuromesodermal and mesodermal fate.  
   • CDX/TCF–LEF (Wnt-responsive) – posterior elongation signals.  
   • TBX16/6 and related TBX factors – mesoderm segmentation.  
   • MEF2 / SRF – myogenic differentiation of fast muscle.  
   • SOX2/5/19 & IRX/PAX6 – posterior neural tube specification.  
   • E2F-cell-cycle module – high proliferative capacity of tail-bud progenitors.  
   • NFAT/RFX (M09419, M082…) – early neuronal activity and ciliary genes.

In summary, peak-cluster 9 represents a temporally rising, posterior-axis chromatin programme that is maximally open in tail-bud/NMP and presomitic mesoderm at mid-somitogenesis and remains active in their muscle and spinal-cord descendants. It is governed by a combination of HOX–PBX/MEIS positional cues, Wnt-CDX/TBX elongation factors and lineage-specific regulators that initiate skeletal-muscle and neuronal differentiation.

## Cluster 10

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 10 – concise biological read-out

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable in presomitic mesoderm at the 0–5-somite stages (10–12 hpf) but rises steeply during somitogenesis.  
   • Highest values are reached between 10–30 somites (≈14–24 hpf) when myotome differentiation and sarcomere assembly are in full swing (e.g. fast-muscle 10 s: 34; 20 s: 38; somites 10 s: 18).  
   • After 30 somites accessibility plateaus / slightly declines, consistent with completion of early trunk muscle patterning.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest → lowest)  
   • Fast skeletal muscle fibres (fast_muscle)  
   • Maturing myotome / segmented somites (somites, muscle)  
   • Presomitic mesoderm & tail bud (PSM, tail_bud)  
   • Notochord (structurally related, also shows high scores)  
   • Other lineages (neuronal, endodermal, epidermal, etc.) display only basal accessibility (~4–7).  
   ⇒ The cluster is therefore highly specific for the paraxial-mesoderm → skeletal-muscle axis.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   Gene set is dominated by:  
   • Myogenic regulatory genes (myod1, myf5, myog, myf6, mymk, myom1/2, myoz2, desma, tnni/t, tpm, acta1, actc1, myh7, myl genes).  
   • Sarcomere and excitation–contraction genes (ryr1/3, cacna1, atp2a1, tnnc2, neb, dystrophin complex, caveolin-cavin, troponins).  
   • ECM/attachment and patterning genes (lama2, col19a1, itga11, cdh15).  
   • Early mesoderm patterning TFs (tbx16, tbx18, mesp, foxc, lbx, pax3/7).  
   Functional enrichment therefore points to skeletal-muscle specification, myoblast fusion, sarcomere organisation and maturation of the trunk locomotor apparatus.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & RNA co-expression)  
   • bHLH myogenic core: Myod1 / Myf5 (E-box motifs) – initiate myogenic fate.  
   • MEF2 family (mef2aa/ab/ca/cb/d) – reinforce and maintain muscle gene expression (strong motif z-scores ≈4).  
   • SRF / MRTF axis and TEAD/TCF factors – cooperate in actin-cytoskeleton & sarcomere gene activation.  
   • TBX factors (Tbx16, Tbx18, Tbx5/15) – pattern paraxial mesoderm and couple myogenesis with segmentation.  
   • Runx3 / Runx1 and Fox (Foxc/Foxo) motifs appear but with lower scores, likely reflecting secondary regulation (tendon/ECM, metabolic genes).  

In sum, peak-cluster 10 marks enhancers that switch on progressively during somitogenesis in paraxial mesoderm, reaching maximal activity in fast skeletal-muscle fibres, and are governed by the canonical MyoD-MEF2 myogenic transcriptional circuit together with Tbx segmentation inputs.
]

## Cluster 11

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 11 corresponds to the paraxial-mesoderm / nascent skeletal-muscle programme that accompanies segmentation and myotome maturation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already elevated at the 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf) and rises steadily through somitogenesis, reaching its maximum at 20- to 30-somite stages (≈18–24 hpf).  
• This pattern matches the transition from pre-somitic mesoderm to differentiated myotome.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signals are seen in:  
• Somites (all time-points; strongest of any cell type)  
• Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and tail-bud mesoderm  
• Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) and early fast-muscle clusters  
Accessibility is uniformly lower in neural, endodermal, cardiac, ectodermal or endothelium lineages, indicating strong lineage restriction to paraxial mesoderm / muscle.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
• Early segmentation/mesoderm patterning: msgn1, tbx6/ta, mespab, ripply2, wnt16, lfef1.  
• Myogenic determination & differentiation: pax3/7, myf5, myod1, myog, myf6, tcf21.  
• Sarcomere and contraction genes: tnn, tnnc2, myl (myosin light chains), ryr2/3, cacna1, desmin, titin.  
• Calcium signalling & metabolic support: atp2a1/3, slc8a, pdk, cpt1c.  
• Extracellular-matrix & tendon/enthesis components: col12a1/col21a1, tnfaip6, postna, vcanb – consistent with myotome/dermomyotome derivatives.  
Collectively these loci define the genetic cascade that converts paraxial mesoderm into contractile trunk muscle.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (supported by motif enrichment and gene co-expression)  
• Myogenic bHLH factors: MYF5, MYOD1, MYOG, MYF6 (motifs M08175, M04248, etc.).  
• MEF2 family (MEF2A/B/C/D) and SRF – activate structural muscle genes.  
• Wnt/TCF axis: TCF7, TCF7L2, LEF1 – integrates Wnt signals that maintain PSM and activate Msgn1/Myod.  
• PAX3/PAX7 – dermomyotome specification.  
• TBX6/TA, MSGN1 – segmentation clock / early paraxial identity.  
• TCF21 & TWIST family – transition to myotome connective tissue.  
• FOXC1/FOXF2 and HOX–C cluster factors provide rostro-caudal patterning inputs.  
• E2F/Cell-cycle TFs (E2F1-4, E2F7/8) are enriched but likely reflect rapid proliferation of early PSM/NMPs rather than lineage identity.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 11 captures a temporally-progressive, somite-restricted chromatin programme that begins in presomitic mesoderm, intensifies during somite segmentation, and culminates in skeletal-muscle differentiation. The regulatory logic is driven by the canonical myogenic TF hierarchy (PAX3/7 → MYF5/MYOD1 → MYOG/MEF2) working in concert with TBX6/MSGN1 segmentation factors and Wnt-responsive TCF proteins.

## Cluster 12

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 12 captures the chromatin program that accompanies late-stage neuronal differentiation, with a particular bias toward neural-crest-derived enteric neurons.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises gradually during somitogenesis but jumps at the 30-somite stage (≈ 24 hpf).  
   • The strongest increase is seen between the 20- and 30-somite samples, indicating that these regions become fully open during early organogenesis when neurons start to mature and wire up.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest signals (≥ 4 AU)  
   • Enteric neurons (0 → 15 → 20 → 30 somites: 3.1 → 3.9 → 4.5 → 15.7) – clear outlier peak.  
   • Differentiating CNS neurons (hindbrain / spinal cord / generic “neural”) – steady 2.8–4.3 rise.  
   • Other neural crest derivatives (pharyngeal-arches neurons, cranial ganglia) show moderate enrichment.  
   Very low or lost accessibility in non-neural tissues (epidermis, muscle, mesoderm, endoderm).

3. Biological processes implied  
   Associated-gene catalogue is heavily enriched for:  
   • Axon growth & guidance – ROBO1/2/3, NTN, SLITs, SEMA3/4/5/6, PLXNA/B, L1CAM family.  
   • Synaptic assembly & neurotransmission – SNAP25, SYT2, UNC13B, RIMS2, NRXN/NLGN sets, GRIK / GRIN glutamate receptors, many voltage-gated K⁺/Ca²⁺ channels (KCN, CACN genes).  
   • Neurotransmitter specification of autonomic/enteric neurons – PHOX2A/2B targets, TH, GATA3, RET, EDNRB pathway members.  
   • Activity-dependent maturation – NPAS4, MEF2, NFAT-responsive genes.  
   In aggregate the cluster marks promoters/enhancers needed for terminal differentiation and functional maturation of peripheral and central neurons, especially the enteric nervous system.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment > +1.5 z-score & motif-gene map)  
   • SOX family (Sox10, Sox11/12, Sox21) – neural-crest maintenance and neurogenesis.  
   • PHOX2A/PHOX2B & paired PAX3/7 – specify autonomic/enteric neuron identity.  
   • FOX factors (FoxD3, FoxG1, FoxP family) – crest lineage choices and neurite growth.  
   • NFAT (M06010_2.00, 2.5 z) – Ca²⁺/calcineurin-dependent activity of maturing neurons.  
   • MEF2 (mef2a/b/c/d motif set, 1.5–1.7 z) – activity-dependent synaptic genes.  
   • CXXC/KDM2 (M08572_2.00, 2.6 z) – promoter-proximal CpG binding typical of housekeeping/neuronal promoters, consistent with the broad gene set.  
   • ROR/NR2F nuclear-receptor motifs (1.4–1.7 z) – regulators of circadian and axonal genes.  
   Collectively these TFs form the regulatory circuit that converts migratory neural-crest cells into fully functional enteric and central neurons and tunes activity-dependent genes at 24 hpf.

In summary, peak-cluster 12 represents a late-somite, neuron-specific chromatin program that peaks in enteric neurons while being shared across differentiating neuronal populations, driven by SOX/PHOX2/Fox/NFAT/MEF2 transcriptional networks controlling axonogenesis and synaptic maturation.
]

## Cluster 13

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 13 represents an early‐acting, trunk-mesoderm regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is highest at the start of segmentation (0–5-somite stage ≈10-12 hpf: somites_0 = 17.5, somites_5 = 16.3, muscle_0 = 14.6, notochord_0 = 14.3, floor-plate_0 = 14.4).  
   • Signal steadily decays through 10–30 somites (e.g. somites_30 ≈ 13), indicating an “early-burst / fading” profile typical of patterning enhancers.  
   • The isolated spike in neural telencephalon_30 (≈ 3 × 10²) is an outlier and likely technical; it is not paralleled in other neural compartments and can be ignored biologically.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is confined to tissues derived from paraxial/axial mesoderm and adjacent mid-line structures:  
   • Newly formed somites and presomitic mesoderm  
   • Early myogenic population (“muscle_0/5”)  
   • Notochord and floor-plate  
   • To a lesser extent neural-crest / enteric-neuron progenitors that mingle with trunk mesoderm early on.  
   The signal is low-to-moderate in endoderm, heart, brain and other later lineages.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Gene set and motif composition point to pathways that lay down trunk identity and initiate myogenesis. Enriched functions include:  
   • Somitogenesis / segmentation clock (Mesp, Tbx6/16, Ripply, Uncx, Cdx, Hes/Her)  
   • Antero-posterior axial patterning (dense coverage of HoxA/B/C/D motifs and genes)  
   • Early skeletal-muscle specification (MyoD, Myf5/6, Myogenin, Mef2, Pax3/7)  
   • Mid-line and sclerotome signalling (Shh, Pax1/9, Nkx, Dlx, Lhx families)  
   • A general proliferation signature (E2F, Myc) that accompanies rapid somite cell cycling.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (supported by motif z-scores and TF-gene presence)  
   • Hox class (Hoxa9-13, Hoxb1-8, Hoxc6/9/10) – axial identity  
   • T-box factors (Tbx6/Tbx16, Tbx18, Tbx24) – segmentation, myotome border formation  
   • Mesoderm-segmentation factors - Mesp-a/b, Cdx1/4, Ripply, Uncx4.1  
   • Myogenic bHLH factors – MyoD, Myf5, Myog, Mef2 family  
   • Pax3/Pax7 and Lbx1/2 – dermomyotome and migrating muscle precursors  
   • Sox5/6/9 and Fox family (Foxc1/2, Foxf1/2) – connective tissue and sclerotome patterning  
   • Nkx2-2/2-5/3-2 and Lhx2/5/9 – mid-line and motor-neuron boundary cues  
   • E2F1-3/7/8 – cell-cycle drive during rapid somite addition.

In summary, peak-cluster 13 marks a cohort of enhancers/promoters that open transiently during early trunk segmentation and musculature set-up, orchestrated by Hox, Tbx/Mesp, Pax, MyoD-family and supporting Fox/Sox/Nkx factors.

## Cluster 14

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 14 highlights the chromatin programme that turns a “generic” endoderm sheet into organ-forming fore-/mid-gut tissue and closely associated cardiopharyngeal mesoderm.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises steadily after gastrulation, becoming obvious at 5–10 somites and reaching a maximum between 15–30 somites (≈ 18–24 hpf), i.e. at the onset of early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest average accessibility)  
   • Definitive endoderm (all stages; strongest signal)  
   • Endoderm-derived endocrine-pancreatic progenitors  
   • Fore-gut/ lateral-plate mesoderm derivatives – heart myocardium, hemangioblast tail-bud domain (posterior gut/pharyngeal mesendoderm)  
   • Very low in neural, somitic, epidermal and other ectodermal compartments.

3. Putative biological processes regulated  
   • Endoderm maturation and regionalisation (fore-/mid-gut patterning)  
   • Initiation of pancreatic, hepatic and intestinal gene programmes (foxa, hnf, pdx1, onecut, gata signatures in gene list)  
   • Early cardiopharyngeal specification (gata4/5/6, hand2, tbx5, nkx2-5 present)  
   • Metabolic/glandular differentiation pathways (lipid transport, secretory pathway genes – abca, slc, apoc, slc transporters, etc.).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (supported by motif enrichment + co-expressed genes)  
   • GATA family – Gata4/5/6 motifs with the highest enrichment score (M04665_2.00, z ≈ 3.5); genes strongly expressed in the same cells.  
   • FOXA pioneer factors – Foxa1/2/3 motifs (M08175_2.00, M07994_2.00, z ≈ 3.1–3.4); essential for opening endoderm chromatin.  
   • HNF network – Hnf4a/g, Hnf1b, Onecut1/2/3 motifs moderate but genes abundant; drive gut/liver/pancreas programmes.  
   • PDX1 and SOX17/32 appear in gene list (classical fore-gut / pancreatic regulators).  
   • Cardiopharyngeal TFs – Tbx5/20, Hand2, Nkx2-5 motifs enriched at lower amplitude, matching accessibility seen in heart mys.  
   • Additional support factors: NR (nr5a2, raraa), C/EBP and Srebf motifs point to emerging metabolic functions of gut epithelium.

In sum, cluster 14 demarcates enhancers/promoters that open late-gastrula to early-organogenesis in definitive endoderm and its derivatives, governed primarily by pioneer FOXA factors working with GATA and HNF/PDX/Onecut transcription factors, and secondarily by GATA/TBX/NKX factors that act in the neighbouring cardiopharyngeal mesoderm.
]

## Cluster 15

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15 captures the myogenic transcriptional programme that turns on as paraxial mesodermal cells leave the presomitic mesoderm and mature into contractile skeletal muscle fibres.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already above background at the 0- to 20-somite stages but rises steeply at the 30-somite/24 hpf stage (muscle_30 somites = 48; fast-muscle_15–30 somites = 4.6–5.8 vs ≈ 3.5–4.2 elsewhere), indicating a late-somite surge that coincides with terminal muscle fibre differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• The highest signals are in “muscle”, “fast-muscle” and “somites”, with much weaker accessibility in non-muscle lineages.  
• Moderate signal in presomitic mesoderm and early somites suggests the cluster begins to open in progenitors but reaches maximal accessibility only after myotome formation.

3. Regulatory programme represented  
• Associated genes are enriched for structural and contractile muscle components (ACTA1, ACTC1, MYH6/7, MYL4, TNNC2, TNNI1/2, TPM1–3) and regulators of sarcomere assembly, calcium handling and muscle-specific metabolism.  
• Gene ontology points to “skeletal muscle differentiation”, “sarcomere organisation”, “muscle contraction” and “striated-muscle development”.  
• Thus the peak-set likely comprises enhancers that drive the maturation of skeletal muscle fibres and the build-up of the contractile apparatus.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
Motif enrichment and TF lists converge on the canonical myogenic battery:  
• Myogenic bHLH factors – Myod1, Myf5, Myog, Myf6/MRF4, Msc (bhlha15)  
• MEF2 family – Mef2a/b/c/d, SRF (MADS-box)  
• Co-regulators of myotome patterning – Pax3/7, Tbx6/18, Tcf21, Lef1/TCF7, TEAD/TEF, Runx1/2/3  
• Chromatin partners – Kdm2b/Cxxc1, E2Fs (reflecting the proliferation–differentiation switch).  

Together these TFs explain the late, muscle-restricted accessibility spike and implicate cluster 15 as a core enhancer module for zebrafish skeletal-muscle differentiation and functional maturation.
]

## Cluster 16

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 16 highlights an early cranio-facial regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is maximal from the 0- to 10-somite stages (≈10–14 hpf).  
• It remains elevated up to 15–20 somites and collapses by the 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf).  
This profile matches the narrow developmental window when cranial neural-crest cells invade the pharyngeal region and begin patterning the arches.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• By far the strongest signal is in pharyngeal-arch mesenchyme (pharyngeal_arches 0–20 somites; extreme spike at the 0-somite sample).  
• Secondary but consistent accessibility is seen in cranial neural-crest clusters, lateral-plate mesoderm and early notochord/somite mesoderm—cell populations that either give rise to, or interact with, the arches.  
• Most neuro-ectoderm, endoderm and trunk mesoderm populations show only baseline accessibility (~5–6).

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Gene set and motif content point to:  
• Cranial neural-crest migration and specification (dlx2/4/5/6, barx1, prrx1a/b, foxd3, tfap2 family).  
• Segmental patterning of the pharyngeal arches and anterior–posterior identity (hoxa2, hoxb2/3, hoxd3, meis/pbx cofactors).  
• Early chondro-/osteogenesis and extracellular-matrix production required for mandibular and hyoid cartilages (col11a1b, col9a1a, mmp23b, fgf8b, pdgfra).  
• EMT and morphogen-responsive pathways typical of arch mesenchyme (Wnt, FGF, PDGF, BMP‐responsive genes; abundant Msx, Fox and Gata motifs).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment together with correlated TF expression nominates:  
• DLX homeobox factors (Dlx4a/5a/6a) – core regulators of branchial-arch crest.  
• BARX1, ALX1/3/4 and PRRX1 – mesenchymal identity and jaw skeletal patterning.  
• HOXA2/HOXB2/HOXB3 with MEIS/PBX cofactors – rostro-caudal arch patterning code.  
• MSX1/2 and SP8/SP9 – BMP–responsive epithelial/mesenchymal signalling.  
• TFAP2 (a/c/e) and FOX family (Foxd3, Foxc1, Foxl1) – neural-crest specification and arch mesenchyme proliferation.  
• Minor but significant support from GATA (gata3/6) and RUNX (runx2a/b) motifs, anticipating later cartilage and bone differentiation.

Taken together, peak cluster 16 demarcates the cis-regulatory landscape that initiates and patterns zebrafish pharyngeal arches during early segmentation, coupling neural-crest-derived mesenchyme with positional HOX cues to launch craniofacial skeletogenesis.
]

## Cluster 17

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 17 corresponds to a large set of promoter-like/CpG-island regions that are open almost genome-wide during the first day of zebrafish development and then slowly tighten as cells terminally differentiate.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at the earliest sampled stage (0–5 somites, ≈10–12 hpf) and remains high through 10–20 somites.  
   • Signal drops noticeably by 30 somites (≈24 hpf) in most lineages (e.g. NMPs fall from ~6 to <1 log-counts), indicating progressive promoter compaction once organ primordia are established.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest values are seen in highly proliferative, still-multipotent populations – neuromesodermal progenitors, early paraxial mesoderm, generic neural progenitors and early endoderm.  
   • Accessibility is moderate in intermediate progenitors (differentiating neurons, hemangioblasts, pancreatic buds) and lowest in lineage-committed or very specialized tissues (mature muscle, hatching-gland, tail-bud tip).

3. Regulatory programme  
   • The associated gene list is essentially “house-keeping + early patterning”: core cell-cycle genes (E2Fs, MCMs, CDKs), metabolic enzymes, translation / splicing factors, plus broad developmental regulators (many HOX, SOX, FOX, PAX, GATA loci).  
   • GO/KEGG themes therefore cluster around:  
     – Fundamental biosynthesis & energy metabolism  
     – DNA replication / mitosis  
     – Generic chromatin organisation and “competence” for later fate decisions.  
   • Functionally, this peak-set provides the open chromatin backbone needed for high transcriptional throughput in rapidly dividing embryonic cells, while keeping key developmental loci poised.

4. Key transcription factors driving the signature  
   Highest motif z-scores and motif-to-factor mapping point to:  
   • CXXC/KDM2-family (Kdm2ba/b, Cxxc1) – classic binders of unmethylated CpG-island promoters, explaining the ubiquitous, promoter-like behaviour.  
   • E2F (E2F1/2/3/4/7) – drives S-phase and is active in all fast-cycling early progenitors.  
   • General pioneer / competence factors: FOX (FoxA/D/G/K/J), SOX (Sox2/3/11/19), SP/KLF and NRF/NR2F families that keep promoters nucleosome-free.  
   • Broad developmental regulators (HOX, PAX, GATA, SIX) are also enriched, but likely reflect the sheer number of genes represented rather than cell-type-restricted control.

In short, peak-cluster 17 captures the “core-promoter/CpG-island” programme that underpins rapid cell proliferation and sets the chromatin ground-state early in zebrafish embryogenesis, peaking during gastrulation–early segmentation and tapering as cells exit the cell cycle and commit to specific organ lineages.
]

## Cluster 18

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 18 – concise interpretation

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility strongly rises already at the onset of somitogenesis and peaks between 10-15 somites (≈14-18 hpf).  
   • After the peak it drops in the hatching-gland but remains stably high in the endocrine-pancreas up to 30 somites (24 hpf).  
   • Thus the module is an early somite-stage programme that is later retained only in a subset of endodermal derivatives.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest ATAC signal)  
   1. Hatching-gland (extreme values: 43–53; biggest contributor)  
   2. Endocrine-pancreas (12–16 throughout the series)  
   3. General endoderm / anterior fore-gut (6–10)  
   Other tissues show only baseline (~4–6).  The profile therefore marks secretory lineages that originate from anterior endoderm / pre-chordal plate.

3. Implied biological programme  
   • Specification and maturation of secretory gland cells – chorion-digesting hatching-gland cells and insulin/peptide-secreting pancreatic endocrine cells.  
   • Fore-gut/endoderm patterning, epithelial polarity and high secretory/ER capacity (supported by many ER, vesicle-trafficking and ECM genes in the list).  
   • Early transcriptional priming of β-like endocrine cells (pdx1, isl1, pax6, rfx6, maf, gata4/6, insr genes present).

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
   Motif enrichment together with correlated gene expression points to a classic fore-gut/endocrine TF cocktail:  
   • GATA factors – Gata4/5/6 (highest motif set; drives endoderm & gland gene expression).  
   • PDX1 – hallmark of pancreatic endocrine fate; motif highly enriched (homeobox, M03444/M03072 high z-score).  
   • PAX6 / PAX2/8 – required for hatching-gland and islet differentiation.  
   • MAF family (Mafa/Mafb/Mafk) – β-cell maturation, secretory gene up-regulation.  
   • FOXA/FOXF (pioneer factors opening endodermal chromatin).  
   • Nuclear receptors HNF4A / NR5A2 (LRH-1) – fore-gut metabolic programme.  
   • RFX3/6 – endocrine-pancreas ciliogenesis/insulin-gene regulation.  

Together these observations indicate that peak-cluster 18 captures an “anterior secretory endoderm” regulatory module that is activated during early somitogenesis, drives hatching-gland function, and is subsequently co-opted for endocrine-pancreas differentiation and maintenance.
]

## Cluster 19

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 19 corresponds to a large set of regulatory elements that are open very broadly early in development and then progressively shut down in the most differentiated tissues.  Its behaviour and annotation point to a “pan-embryonic patterning/priming” program rather than a lineage-restricted enhancer set.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at the 0-somite stage, rises further at the 5–15-somite stages (≈11–18 hpf) and begins to fall by the 20-somite stage in several lineages.  
• By the 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf) cluster 19 is markedly closed in many terminal tissues (e.g. epidermis, differentiated muscle, hatching-gland) while still detectable in progenitor-rich compartments.  
 →  The peaks behave like early developmental/“primed” regulatory regions that are switched off once cells commit.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest average accessibility is seen in cell types that remain multipotent or are still patterning:  
• Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) and presomitic mesoderm (PSM) up to 15 s.  
• Neural progenitors and neural crest, hindbrain, spinal cord.  
• Early endoderm and haemato-vascular progenitors.  
• Reduced or lost at 30 s in epidermis, differentiated muscle, hatching-gland, mature myocardium, etc.  
Thus the cluster marks “embryonic progenitor” chromatin rather than any one germ-layer.

3. Regulatory programme implied  
The associated-gene list is heavily enriched for developmental transcription-factor loci (Hox, Sox, Fox, Pax, Nkx, Gata, Six, Dlx, Meis, Runx, etc.) together with cell-cycle/metabolic genes needed in rapidly dividing progenitors.  
Functional themes:  
• Anterior–posterior and dorsoventral body-axis patterning (HOX + retinoic-acid‐responsive elements).  
• Segmentation and somitogenesis (Mesp, Tbx, Meis, Ripply, Uncx).  
• Neural and neural-crest specification (SoxB, Pax3/7, Irx, Zic).  
• Early endoderm/mesoderm organ-field establishment (Gata, FoxA/D/F, Nkx2).  
Taken together, cluster 19 represents a set of enhancers/promoters that “prime” core developmental regulators across the embryo before lineage-specific programmes take over.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
Motif enrichment (top positive Z-scores) and motif–factor mapping point to:  
• HOX paralog groups → axial patterning & RA response.  
• FOX family (FoxA, FoxD, FoxG, FoxK) → germ-layer and organ-field priming.  
• SOX family (Sox2/3/19/21, Sox10) → neural/crest competence.  
• PAX3/7, PAX6 → neural plate border, early neural patterning.  
• NKX homeodomain factors (Nkx1/2/5) → foregut, heart and neural tube priming.  
• Nuclear-receptor motifs (RAR/RXR, COUP-TF/NR2F, ROR, PPAR) → retinoic-acid and lipid-sensing signals that gate HOX and metabolic genes.  
• E2F/FOXM1 → proliferation-linked promoter accessibility in cycling progenitors.  
• MEF2, GATA, SIX/DLX enrichments support mesodermal, endodermal and cranial-neural-crest aspects.

In summary, peak cluster 19 captures a widespread, early-acting regulatory layer that keeps the chromatin of developmental master regulators accessible in virtually all progenitor pools during gastrulation-to-segmentation stages; these regions are then silenced as cells exit the patterning phase and embark on terminal differentiation.

## Cluster 20

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 20 marks a set of regulatory elements that are reused during two successive morphogenetic events – the formation of the eye field and the maturation of the embryonic heart.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• 10–14 hpf (0–10 somites): high accessibility in neural-optic progenitors (14.4 at 0 som, 14.8 at 10 som) but only basal signal elsewhere.  
• 18–24 hpf (20–30 somites): accessibility shifts to the heart; it rises modestly at 20 som (5.6) and explodes at 30 som in myocardium (64.3).  
→ The cluster is therefore biphasic: early optic, late cardiac.

2. Cell-type specificity (peak accessibility)  
• Early phase – optic neuro‐ectoderm (“neural_optic”).  
• Late phase – differentiated cardiomyocytes (“heart_myocardium”), with by far the highest signal of all pseudobulks.  
• Background levels (~5) are seen in many other tissues but never approach the optic/heart amplitudes.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
a) Eye-field / retinal specification  
   – Associated genes: pax6a/b, rx1/2/3, vsx1/2, crx, otx1/2, sox2/3, shox2.  
   – GO terms point to photoreceptor differentiation, optic vesicle patterning and axon guidance.  

b) Cardiac muscle differentiation & contractile apparatus assembly  
   – Associated genes: tbx5a/b, tbx20, mef2ca/aa, nkx2.5, actc1c, myh7, tnni1b, tnni2b, myl2a, ryr3, vegfaa, wnt11.  
   – Enriched pathways: sarcomere organisation, calcium handling, cardiac morphogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (supported by top motif z-scores and the TF-mapping table)  
• MEF2 family (M05682_2.00; z = 4.0) – master regulators of cardiac/myogenic transcription.  
• T-box factors TBX5/TBX20 (M04785_2.00; z = 2.8).  
• GATA4/5/6 (M10138_2.00; z = 2.3) – cooperate with TBX and MEF2 in cardiomyocytes.  
• PAX6/RX/VSX homeodomain motifs (M09419_2.00; z = 2.2) – canonical for eye-field genes.  
• SOX2/3/11 (M02428_2.00; z = 2.2) – maintain optic neuro-ectodermal identity.  
Minor but consistent enrichments: bHLH/Clock family (bHLHE, NEUROD) and MAF/TFE factors, fitting retinal and cardiac metabolic maturation.

In summary, peak-cluster 20 contains enhancers that first drive optic-neuroectoderm genes and are later redeployed (or newly activated) in differentiating cardiomyocytes, under the control of eye-field TFs (PAX, SOX, RX) and later of the canonical cardiac trio (GATA–TBX–MEF2).

## Cluster 21

[*assistant*:
Peak Cluster 21 – summary interpretation

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Highest accessibility during the first half of somitogenesis (0-15 somites ≈ 10–18 hpf).  
• Accessibility falls noticeably by 20 somites and is lowest by 30 somites (≈ 24 hpf), indicating that the regions are most important for early segmentation and the onset of myogenesis rather than late organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest columns in the pseudobulk profile)  
• Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs)  
• Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and tail-bud mesoderm  
• Newly formed somites and nascent fast-muscle fibres  
• Moderate signal in notochord; very low in endoderm, neural, pancreas, etc.

3. Associated developmental programme  
The peak set is enriched for genes that build the trunk/tail paraxial mesoderm and drive skeletal-muscle formation:  
– Segmentation / axial elongation: tbxta, msgn1, tbx6 / tbx16, mespab/mespaa, ripply1/2, her7, dllc, wnt8a, fgf8a.  
– Patterning: extensive HOX9-13, Cdx1/4, Lef1, Rspo/Wnt targets.  
– Myogenic commitment and differentiation: pax3/7, myf5, myod1, myog, myf6, acta1a, myl1, mylz3, ttn, mef2 family.  
– Extracellular-matrix and myofibrillar genes (fn1, lama2, col genes, cav3, dystrophin, etc.).  
Collectively these regions appear to act as enhancers/promoters that hand the transcriptional baton from proliferative paraxial progenitors to differentiating skeletal muscle.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (from motif enrichment + gene list)  
• T-box factors: Tbx6, Tbx16, Tbxta – specify paraxial mesoderm and initiate segmentation.  
• Wnt/β-catenin effectors: TCF7/TCF7L1/Lef1 – maintain NMP/PSM identity.  
• MRFs: Myf5, Myod1, Myog, Myf6 – launch the myogenic cascade as somites mature.  
• MEF2 family – activate structural muscle genes.  
• HOX (mostly group 9-13) & Cdx – confer rostro-caudal positional identity within the mesoderm.  
• Pax3/7 and Six family – early myogenic/dermomyotome regulators.  
• E2F/FOXM1 – signals of the high proliferative state of early PSM cells.

Taken together, Peak Cluster 21 marks a mesodermal–myogenic enhancer module that is switched on in early trunk/tail progenitors, peaks during active segmentation, and then diminishes as skeletal-muscle differentiation proceeds.

## Cluster 22

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 22 – concise biological annotation

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises steadily through somitogenesis and peaks at the two latest stages we profiled (20- to 30-somite embryos, ≈ 22–24 hpf).  
   • Early gastrula/early-somite samples show only basal signal (≈ 5.5–6 log-CPM); late-somite epidermis reaches the maximal values (> 8 log-CPM, 9 + after rescaling).

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in derivatives of the non-neural ectoderm and cranial mesenchyme:  
   • Surface ectoderm / epidermis (all time-points, strongest at 15–30 somites).  
   • Neural-crest–derived populations (migrating crest, enteric neurons, pharyngeal-arch mesenchyme).  
   • Moderate signal in paraxial mesoderm / early somites and in general trunk mesenchyme.  
   Thus the cluster marks cells that secrete or remodel extracellular matrix as they spread, migrate or envelop the embryo surface.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
   The gene set is highly enriched for:  
   • Structural ECM components – many collagens (col1a1/2, col12, col14, col27, col6 family), fibronectin (fn1), laminins (lamα/β/γ), elastin-like and fibrillin genes, integrin sub-units, tenascin (tnc) and thrombospondins.  
   • Matrix-remodelling enzymes (mmp14-17, adamts2/3/6/8/12/17, adam12) and adhesive receptors (cadherins, Itgα5/β5/β6).  
   • Mesenchymal/EMT and craniofacial markers (prrx1/2, twist1/2/3, snai1a/2, barx1, dlx3/4/6, lhx2/9, hox A/C cluster genes).  
   Together these point to a programme that builds and remodels the embryonic extracellular matrix required for epidermal sheet expansion, neural-crest migration and branchial-arch morphogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene presence)  
   • Homeobox cofactors PBX1-4 / MEIS1-3 (highest motif Z-scores; many pbx/meis genes expressed) – cooperate with Hox factors to regionalise cranial and trunk mesenchyme.  
   • HOX class TFs (multiple anterior and posterior Hox motifs enriched) – pattern-specific control of ECM gene batteries.  
   • AP-1 / ATF family (FOS, JUN, ATF3) – classic regulators of collagen, integrin and MMP genes during morphogenesis and wound-like epithelial spreading.  
   • PRRX1/2, TWIST1/2 and SNAI1 – motifs and genes present; drive mesenchymal identity and EMT-related ECM production.  
   • TP63 / TFAP2 / GRHL (moderate enrichment) – reinforce epidermal-specific enhancers.  
   • NFE2L (Nrf) and BACH factors – support oxidative-stress-responsive ECM gene regulation often seen in actively migrating epithelial sheets.

Summary  
Cluster 22 represents an “extracellular-matrix / mesenchymal expansion” enhancer set that turns on late in somitogenesis, is strongest in surface ectoderm and cranial-crest-derived mesenchyme, and is orchestrated by PBX/MEIS-HOX complexes together with AP-1 and EMT TFs (PRRX, TWIST, SNAI).
]

## Cluster 23

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 23 represents a set of regulatory elements that behave like “core-promoter / proliferation” chromatin.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • The peaks are already highly open at the 0-somite stage (10 hpf) in most lineages, dip slightly between 5- and 20-somites, and rise again to their highest values at 30-somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • Thus the cluster stays accessible throughout the gastrula-to-organogenesis window but is maximally active in late-somite embryos when rapid cell division is still widespread.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Accessibility is broad, but the highest signals are seen in highly proliferative progenitor compartments:  
     – Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP) and tail-bud derivatives  
     – Presomitic mesoderm / newly formed somites  
     – Floor-plate / spinal cord, hindbrain and mid–hindbrain boundary neuroepithelium  
     – Hematopoietic/vasculature progenitors (peak value)  
   • Differentiated or slowly dividing cell types (enteric neurons, endocrine pancreas, mature muscle) show the lowest accessibility.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Associated gene set is dominated by ubiquitously expressed, growth-related genes: ribosomal proteins, translation factors, DNA-replication and cell-cycle regulators (pcna, mki67, ccnb1, e2f targets), chromatin remodelers and basal transcription machinery.  
   • GO/KEGG terms would centre on “DNA replication”, “mitotic cell cycle”, “RNA processing” and “core metabolic processes”.  
   • Hence the cluster likely marks promoters/enhancers that underpin the generic biosynthetic and proliferative programme used by embryonic progenitor cells across lineages.

4. Key transcription factors driving the programme  
   • Motif enrichment with highest Z-scores points to:  
     – E2F family (E2F1/2/3/4/7) and their partner TFDP ⇒ canonical S-phase control.  
     – NF-Y/CBF, ZNF143 and TBP/TFIID motifs ⇒ general promoter activation of housekeeping genes.  
     – SP/KLF family motifs (Sp1/Sp3, Klf4/6/9) ⇒ CpG-rich promoter binding.  
     – FOXM1/FOXO/FOXR (FOXM1, FOXK, FOXO) and MYB/KLF co-motifs ⇒ additional proliferation and chromatin-opening roles.  
   • Together these factors form the well-described cell-cycle / housekeeping transcriptional module.

Summary: Peak-cluster 23 corresponds to a ubiquitous, cell-cycle–linked regulatory module. It stays accessible in most embryonic progenitors, peaks again at 24 hpf, and is driven mainly by E2F, NF-Y/ZNF143, SP/KLF and FOX family factors to support the high biosynthetic output required for rapid embryonic cell proliferation.

## Cluster 24

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24 – concise functional synopsis

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already detectable at early somitogenesis (0–5 somites) but rises steadily through mid-somite stages and reaches its maximum during late somitogenesis / early organogenesis (≈ 30 somites, 22–24 hpf).  
• The single strongest signal is the 30-somite hatching-gland sample (≈ 45-fold higher than baseline), indicating a late, burst-like activation in this secretory tissue.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is seen in:  
• Hatching-gland cells (very strong, late spike)  
• Differentiating neurons & floor-plate derivatives  
• Endocrine pancreas and other epithelial derivatives  
• Mesenchymal/ECM-rich populations (lateral-plate mesoderm, dermomyotome, etc.)  
Conversely, progenitor domains such as neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) or early muscle lose accessibility by 30 somites, showing that the program is tied to differentiation rather than stem-cell maintenance.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
The associated gene set is heavily enriched for extracellular-matrix and matrix-remodelling factors:  
• Structural ECM: many collagens (col1, col5, col6, col12, col14, col16, col28), fibronectin (fn1), tenascin-C (tnc), vitronectin (vtn), fibrillins/fibulins, laminins, elastin-associated genes.  
• Matrix-modifying enzymes: multiple mmp, adam, adamts and lox/loxl family members.  
• Cell-adhesion & signalling: integrins, cadherins, protocadherins, semaphorins, ephrins, Wnt, Fgf and Tgf-β pathway components.  
• Secreted proteases typical of the hatching gland (e.g. hgg proteases) are included.  
Together this points to a broad “ECM-assembly / remodelling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal morphogenesis” module that is deployed as tissues differentiate and, in the hatching gland, to digest the chorion.

4. Likely key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment and motif-to-factor mapping converge on TFs classically linked to mesenchymal/ECM programmes:  
• FOXC/FOXF family (foxc1/2, foxf1/2) – mesenchymal identity and ECM gene activation.  
• PRRX1/2, TWIST1/2/3, SNAI1/2, ZEB1/2 – EMT and collagen/MMP regulation.  
• TCF21 and RUNX (runx1/2/3) – collagen and smooth-muscle ECM genes.  
• HOX / PBX / MEIS combinations – positional control of ECM patterning.  
• GATA4/5/6 and MEF2 family – supportive roles in endodermal & muscular ECM expression.  
• ETS factors (ETV4/5, FLI1/ERG) – cooperate with RUNX in collagen/MMP promoters.  
Collectively these TFs explain both the broad deployment of the cluster in differentiating mesenchyme/epithelium and the sharp late activation in the hatching gland.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 24 marks a differentiation-associated chromatin programme that orchestrates large-scale extracellular-matrix production and remodelling. It switches on gradually during somitogenesis, becomes most prominent at 24 hpf, and is particularly amplified in the hatching gland where massive ECM-degrading activity is required for hatching. Core regulators include FOXC/FOXF, PRRX/TWIST/SNAI/ZEB EMT factors, TCF21/RUNX and HOX–PBX–MEIS complexes.

## Cluster 25

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 25 marks the chromatin programme that accompanies the emergence of the zebrafish blood-vascular lineage.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already elevated at the 0-somite stage (10 hpf) in “hematopoietic / vasculature” pseudobulks (∼29) and rises sharply between 5- and 20-somites, peaking at 20 somites (42.2).  
   • Signal begins to fall by 30 somites (24 hpf) as endothelial cells mature and lineage-specific programmes diverge.  
   → The window of maximal activity (5–20 somites; ~11–19 hpf) coincides with specification of hemangioblasts, endothelial sheet formation and onset of circulation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is confined to:  
   • Hemangioblasts (21.6 → 31.2)  
   • Hematopoietic / nascent vasculature endothelial cells (28.8 → 42.1)  
   Secondary but lower signals are seen in heart myocardium, lateral-plate mesoderm and endodermal derivatives, consistent with shared mesodermal origin but much weaker than in the haemato-vascular populations.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
   Cluster genes are heavily enriched for vascular / haemangioblast factors and endothelial surface molecules:  
   – VEGF receptors and co-receptors: kdrl/kdr, flt1, flt4, kdr, nrp1a/b, nrp2a  
   – Angiopoietin pathway: tie1, tek  
   – Early endothelial markers: esama, pecam1, cldn5b, cdh5  
   – Haemogenic endothelium / blood regulators: etv2 (etsrp), fli1a/b, erg, tal1, lmo2, runx1, gata1/2/6, gfi1aa/b  
   – Signalling modulators: notch1a/b, dll4, jag1a, vegfc, kdr, tek, sox7/17, foxc1a/b, foxf2  
   Functional GO terms (over-represented): vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, artery/vein specification, haematopoietic stem-cell development.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif Z-scores + gene presence)  
   • ETS family – highest motif Z-scores (M02705, M05588, etc.) and strong expression of etv2, fli1, erg, ets1/2; master regulators of endothelial identity.  
   • GATA factors – motifs and genes (gata1a/b, gata2a/b, gata4/5/6) controlling haemogenic and endocardial/endodermal competence.  
   • TAL1/LMO2 & RUNX1 – motifs enriched (bHLH & RUNT) and genes present; drive blood specification within haemogenic endothelium.  
   • SOXF group (sox7, sox17, sox18) plus FOXC1/2 – motifs with positive scores; cooperate with ETS factors during early vasculogenesis.  
   • Notch pathway TFs (RBPJ binding motif) and NR/PPAR/RXR motifs (nuclear-receptor signatures) appear with moderate enrichment, reflecting metabolic maturation of endothelium.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 25 represents a haemato-vascular enhancer set that opens during early somitogenesis, is most accessible in hemangioblasts and nascent endothelial cells, and is driven principally by ETS-, GATA-, TAL1/LMO2- and RUNX-family transcription factors acting together with SOXF and FOXC/Notch partners to initiate vasculogenesis, angiogenesis and the first wave of embryonic haematopoiesis.
]

## Cluster 26

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 26 represents a very large group of regulatory elements that behave like a “late, pan-developmental patterning module”.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is moderate at the 0- to 5-somite stages (≈10–12 hpf) and rises steadily, reaching maximal values at 20- to 30-somite embryos (≈22–24 hpf).  
   • The gradual gain suggests these sites are engaged during the transition from early pattern specification to overt tissue differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Widely open in many lineages but highest in neural/axial derivatives: floor-plate, hindbrain, spinal cord, mid-brain–hind-brain boundary, differentiating neurons, somites and mature muscle.  
   • Accessibility is lower, though still present, in endodermal (gut, pancreas) and epidermal populations, indicating broad but not truly ubiquitous activity.

3. Putative regulatory programme  
   • Gene set is enormous and enriched for Hox clusters, Pax, Dlx, Six, Nkx, Fox, Sox, nuclear-receptor genes and thousands of differentiation genes; this points to:  
     – Anterior-posterior and dorso-ventral patterning (Hox, Pax, Dlx, Uncx, Cdx).  
     – Neurogenesis and neural tube regionalisation (Sox-B, Otx, Lhx, Phox2, Irx, Barhl, Olig).  
     – Somitogenesis / myogenesis (Mef2, MyoD/MRF motifs; high accessibility in somites & muscle).  
     – General late-organogenesis housekeeping demand (many metabolic and structural genes).  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment)  
   • Homeobox patterning factors: HOX (strongest enrichments M04454, M04399, M03528), PBX/MEIS and Pknox.  
   • Forkhead & Sox family (FOX, SOX) – broad embryonic regulators that cooperate with HOX/PBX.  
   • Paired-box and LIM/Six factors (Pax2/3/6/7, Lhx, Six) – region-specific neural and mesoderm patterning.  
   • Nuclear-receptor cluster (RAR/RXR, NR2F, ROR, PPAR) – retinoic-acid and lipid-responsive patterning cues.  
   • Mef2/SRF and E2F – support terminal differentiation and cell-cycle exit in late somites/muscle and neurons.

Together, these features indicate that peak-cluster 26 comprises enhancers and promoters that come online midway through somitogenesis across many tissues to implement the HOX-centred positional code and drive the final waves of neuronal, muscular and other tissue differentiation.
]

## Cluster 27

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 27 is best explained as an “eye-field / nascent-retina” regulatory module that turns on very early in development and later becomes restricted to differentiating photoreceptors.  

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already extremely high in optic-cup cells at the earliest stage we profiled (0-somite, 10 hpf; 38-fold above background) and remains above baseline through 5–20-somite stages, but essentially disappears from the optic cup by 30 somites.  
   • Outside of the optic lineage the signal is only moderate (≈4–6 a.u.) and largely constant; the single spike seen in “muscle_30somites” is likely an artefact (no myogenic transcriptional or motif signature accompanies it).

2. Cell-type specificity (top accessible pseudobulks)  
   1. optic_cup_0 s > optic_cup_5–20 s  (retinal progenitors)  
   2. neural/neuronal progenitor compartments (hind-/mid-brain, spinal cord, floor plate) – moderate accessibility  
   3. essentially absent from mesodermal/endodermal derivatives except for the spurious muscle_30 s value above.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Associated genes are highly enriched for retinal/photoreceptor functions:  
     – Phototransduction and outer-segment morphogenesis (gnat2, grk1b, rdh5, rp1l1a, opn4xa, opn8b)  
     – Eye-field patterning & early retina (rx1/2/3, vax1/2, rorb, rorcb, pax6a/b, vsx1)  
     – Synaptic signalling genes characteristic of retinal neurons (gria2/4, grik4/5, grin3b, iglon5, tnc, tenm2).  
   • GO/pathway enrichment (not shown but evident from gene list) points to: photoreceptor differentiation, visual perception, retinoic-acid / nuclear-receptor signalling and synaptogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (from motif enrichment + gene list)  
   • Photoreceptor-specific orphan nuclear receptors – NR2E3 (z-score +2.6) and ROR family (RORB/RORC)  
   • Retinoid/RA receptors – RARA/B/G, RXRA/B (multiple nuclear-receptor motifs with z-scores ≥ 2)  
   • Eye-field homeobox factors – CRX, LHX2, RAX/RX (motifs M02428 & M03591; z-scores 2.4–2.6)  
   • PAX6 motif is positively enriched (PAX6-containing motif cluster M05588, z ≈ 1.3) matching strong pax6 expression correlation.  
   • MEF2/NRL class motif (M10117, z ≈ 3.1) – consistent with NRL/MAF family activity during photoreceptor maturation.  

Together, the accessibility profile, gene set and motif landscape indicate that peak-cluster 27 demarcates cis-regulatory elements that initiate the retinal/photoreceptor gene programme immediately after gastrulation and help maintain it until early organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 28

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 28 represents a neuronal/enteric-neuron enhancer set that turns on as the nervous system differentiates.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already above background at 0–5 somites but rises steeply after 10 somites and reaches a maximum at 20–30 somites.  
   • This late-somite activation matches the time when post-mitotic peripheral and central neurons extend axons and begin functional maturation (22–24 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • The largest signals are in enteric-neuron pseudobulks (10 → 71 a.u. from 0 → 30 somites) and differentiating-neurons in the trunk/brain (≈7 → 22 a.u.).  
   • Other neural derivatives (neurons, spinal cord, neural crest, floor plate) show moderate accessibility, whereas mesoderm, endoderm, epidermis and muscle stay at baseline.  
   → Cluster 28 is therefore highly selective for the neuronal lineage, with a pronounced bias toward vagal-crest-derived enteric neurons.

3. Regulatory programme encoded  
   Gene set inspection points to late neuronal differentiation and synaptic assembly:  
   – Neurotransmission/ion-channel genes: many voltage-gated Ca2+ (cacna1aa/ab, cacna1c, cacna2d1/3), K+ channels (kcnq2/3/4/5, kcna/kcnb), glutamate, GABA and acetylcholine transporters/receptors (slc17a6/7, gad1/2, gabra/b/g, slc5a7a, slc18a2, grin/grik).  
   – Axon guidance & synaptogenesis: robo1/3/4, nrg1/2, neurexins (nrxn1/2/3), contactins, cadm/cntn families, synaptic vesicle genes (snap25, stxbp1a, sv2).  
   – ENS-specific regulators: ret, gfra1/2/3/4, phox2a/2b, isl1/2, hand2, slc6a3.  
   – Patterning/identity cues: extensive Hox, Pbx, Meis and Dlx coverage, reflecting antero-posterior and autonomic lineage patterning.  
   Collectively the cluster marks enhancers needed for terminal neuronal differentiation, especially of the autonomic/enteric system.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment together with expressed TFs highlights four cooperating modules:  
   • HOX–PBX–MEIS complex (high Z-scores for HOX/PBX motifs; meisa/1b/2a/2b, pbx1/3/4 present) – regional identity of trunk/vagal neural crest and ENS.  
   • PHOX2 (motifs captured in homeobox pool; phox2a/2b highly expressed) – master regulator of enteric and sympathetic neurons.  
   • SOX10 / SOX21 / SOX4-6 – maintain neural-crest competence and drive neuronal differentiation.  
   • Forkhead and FOXK/FOXM motifs – chromatin opening during neuronal maturation.  
   Supporting factors: LHX (lmx1a/b, lhx2/4/8/9), DLX, IRX, BARHL, EBF, NEUROD and MEF2, all of which appear in the associated-gene list and motif table and are typical of late-born sensory/autonomic neurons.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 28 consists of enhancers that open specifically in differentiating neurons, peaking in enteric neurons during the 20–30 somite stages. It encodes the transcriptional programme for neuronal maturation, synaptogenesis and autonomic/enteric nervous-system specification, driven by HOX-PBX-MEIS/PHOX2, SOX10 and cooperating neuronal TFs.
]

## Cluster 29

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29 marks a late, paraxial-mesoderm programme that “switches on” when zebrafish somites begin to regionalise into sclerotome / dermomyotome–like mesenchyme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is fairly low and flat (≈ 4–6) from gastrulation up to the 20-somite stage, then spikes sharply at the 30-somite (≈ 24 hpf) stage.  
• Largest increases: NMPs_30 som = 64.5 × baseline, Somites_30 som = 70.9 × baseline.  
→ Cluster 29 is therefore a “late-somitogenesis” module that becomes active around 22–24 hpf.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is confined to tissues derived from posterior paraxial mesoderm:  
• Mature segmented somites (myotome/sclerotome compartment)  
• Posterior neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) that feed the tail bud  
Other tissues—including muscle fibres, neural crest, endoderm, etc.—remain at basal levels, indicating strong specificity for the somite lineage.

3. Regulatory/biological programme  
Associated genes are heavily enriched for:  
• Extracellular-matrix and fibroblastic genes – col1a1/2/5/12/14, tnc, lox, fn1, adamts family, tgfb pathway components  
• Early myotome/sclerotome regulators – meox1/2, tbx18, pax1/9, prrx1a/b, alx4a/b, foxc1a/b, foxf2a/b, twist1/2/3, snai2, zeb1, hand2  
• Contractile/actin cytoskeleton genes (acta2, tnni2a, myh11, actn2/3) typical of incipient myofibril assembly  
GO terms (from manual inspection) point to “skeletal system development”, “matrix organisation”, “cell-matrix adhesion” and “mesenchymal cell differentiation”.  
→ Cluster 29 captures the transcriptional and chromatin re-organisation that converts epithelial somites into migratory, ECM-producing sclerotome/dermomyotome mesenchyme that will give rise to axial skeleton, tendon and connective tissue.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment and gene presence highlight a coherent TF set:  
• FOXC/FOXF (foxc1a/b, foxf2a/b) – canonical sclerotome/dorsal dermomyotome factors  
• PRRX1a/b, ALX4a/b, MEIS/PBX & HOX B/C genes – patterning and mesenchymal identity  
• TWIST1/2/3, SNAI1/2, ZEB1 a/b – EMT-like regulators enabling somite epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  
• TBX18 / MEOX1/2 / PAX1 – axial skeleton initiation  
• HAND2, GATA4/6 – lateral mesenchyme and ECM transcription  
• MEF2 & MyoD/Myf5 motifs are present but modest, consistent with early myotome cross-talk rather than terminal muscle differentiation.

Together these factors drive the late-somite mesenchymal programme underlying sclerotome differentiation and trunk connective-tissue formation.

## Cluster 30

[*assistant*:
Peak Cluster 30 – concise interpretation

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest at gastrulation/early segmentation (0-10 somites; 10–14 hpf) but climbs steadily after 15 somites and surges at 20–30 somites (18–24 hpf).  
• Example: enteric-neuron pseudobulk increases from 3.5 (0 som) → 7.8 (20 som) → 31.2 (30 som). The cluster therefore marks the transition to late segmentation / early organogenesis, when neurons are differentiating and wiring.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is seen in neural-crest-derived visceral neuron populations:  
• Enteric neurons >> all other lineages (by an order of magnitude at 30 som).  
• Second-tier accessibility in differentiating generic neurons, hindbrain / spinal cord neural tissue, and vagal neural crest.  
• Mesoderm, endoderm, epidermis and muscle remain at background (~3), indicating the cluster is largely neuro-specific.

3. Regulatory programme represented  
Associated gene list and GO inspection point to:  
• Neuronal maturation and synaptogenesis – ion channels (CACN, KCN, RYR2), neurotransmitter receptors (GRIK2/3, GRM, GABR, GRID, P2RX), synaptic vesicle genes (STXBP1, UNC13, RIMS, SNAP25), adhesion/recognition molecules (NRXN, LRRTM, CNTN, L1-family).  
• Enteric / autonomic neuron identity – RET-signalling co-receptors (GFRA2/4), neurotrophic-response genes (ERBB4, NRGs), PHOX2-, GATA- and SOX-controlled targets.  
• Axon guidance & migration – ROBO1, PLXNs, SEMA4/6, EPH/EPHRIN, DSCAM, L1CAM family.  
• Overall, the cluster appears to group enhancers that drive late differentiation and functional maturation of neural-crest-derived enteric (and related visceral) neurons.

4. Key transcription factors inferred  
Motif enrichment (z > 2) together with motif→factor mapping highlight regulators known for ENS / visceral neuron development:  
• PHOX2A / PHOX2B – terminal selector of autonomic and enteric neurons (motif M05682, M04157).  
• LHX family (LHX2/4/8/9, LMX1A/B) – interneuron subtype specification (motif M04174, M04785).  
• SOX10 & SOX8/9 – neural-crest maintenance and gliogenic/neurogenic switch.  
• GATA2/3 – cholinergic enteric neuron differentiation (motif row 18).  
• FOX (FOXF/FoxD/FoxP) and HOX posterior paralogs – patterning of vagal neural-crest/hindbrain derivatives.  
• E2F/TFDP and MEF2 motifs score positively, consistent with the proliferation-to-differentiation hand-off and later activity-dependent maturation stages.  

Together, these TFs form a programme that first maintains neural-crest progenitors (SOX/FOX), then imposes positional identity (HOX), and finally activates terminal differentiation and synaptic genes through PHOX2/GATA/LHX, matching the temporal and cell-type accessibility profile observed for Peak Cluster 30.

## Cluster 31

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 31 represents a “nuclear-receptor/Hox” regulatory module that is most prominent in posterior axial progenitors and late trunk tissues.

1. Temporal dynamics  
•  Accessibility is modest at gastrulation (0-5 somites), rises steadily during segmentation, and reaches its maximum at 20-30 somites (≈22-24 hpf).  
•  The only early high signal is a spike in pharyngeal-arch cells at 0 somites, consistent with the first retinoic-acid (RA) pulse in anterior mesoderm.  
•  Overall pattern: gradual ramp-up with a clear peak in late somitogenesis / early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
•  Tail-bud / neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) at 30 somites  
•  Mature somites (30 somites) and paraxial mesoderm (PSM 20–30 somites)  
•  Posterior trunk derivatives such as enteric neurons (30 somites)  
•  Early pharyngeal-arch mesenchyme (0-5 somites) shows a secondary peak  
These patterns point to posterior axial tissues that are under strong RA/Hox control.

3. Regulatory program inferred  
•  Hox-driven anterior-posterior patterning and segmentation of trunk and tail  
•  Retinoic-acid signalling (RA) and allied nuclear-receptor pathways (PPAR, ROR, COUP-TF, Rev-Erb)  
•  Genes linked to cranio-facial arch specification and axial mesoderm (large representation of Hox A/B/C/D clusters, Raldh/aldh1a, bmp, fgf, pax, gata etc.)  
•  Additional roles in lipid metabolism and chromatin remodelling, consistent with NR-dependent metabolic set-up of differentiating trunk tissues.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment list)  
•  Retinoic-acid receptors: RAR-γ (rarga, rargb) with obligatory RXR partners (rxraa, rxrab, rxrgb)  
•  COUP-TF/NR2F (nr2f1a/b, nr2f6a/b) – known RA modulators  
•  ROR family (rorab, rorc, rorcb) – posteriorisation and circadian/ metabolic coupling  
•  NR1H/Rev-Erb (nr1d1/2), NR5A (nr5a1/2) and PPAR (ppara, pparg) – metabolic and mesodermal maturation links  
•  Hox factors themselves (multiple hoxb/c/d paralogues enriched in motif table and gene list)  
Together these TFs form the classic RA-responsive enhancer code that drives Hox activation and posterior body formation.

In summary, peak-cluster 31 marks RA-responsive enhancers that become progressively open during somitogenesis, are most accessible in tail-bud/NMP and mature somite populations, and orchestrate Hox-mediated trunk and tail patterning via a nuclear-receptor transcriptional network.

## Cluster 32

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 32 is the chromatin module that turns on while paraxial mesoderm becomes skeletal (trunk) muscle.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low during gastrulation/early-somite stages (0–5 somites) and gradually rises (≈5.5 log-counts) by 10–15 somites.  
   • It reaches a sharp maximum at late-somite/early organogenesis (20–30 somites); the muscle-30-somite pseudo-bulk shows an extreme signal (104 a.u.), indicating a burst of coordinated opening during the last two sampled stages (≈22–24 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is confined to myogenic derivatives:  
   • generic “muscle” and “fast-muscle” pseudobulks at 15–30 somites  
   • maturing “somite” and “PSM” samples show a moderate earlier signal (reflecting myotome precursors)  
   • negligible in neural, endodermal, hematopoietic, or epidermal lineages.  
   A small shoulder is seen in heart myocardium, consistent with shared myogenic circuitry, but the dominant signal is skeletal-muscle–specific.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Gene set contained in or linked to the peaks is heavily enriched for:  
   • sarcomeric structural genes (actc1b, actn3a/b, myh7, myl6/7, tnni2, tnnc, tmod, titin, etc.)  
   • myoblast fusion and myofibril organisation factors (mymk, mymx, crot, fhl3, fhl1)  
   • metabolic/contractility regulators (cpt1, atp2a1/2, ryr1a/b, slc8a1, ckmt2, ppara/ppard targets).  
   GO/KEGG terms therefore point to “muscle contraction”, “sarcomere assembly”, “striated-muscle differentiation” and “oxidative metabolism shift”.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & factor lists)  
   • Myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs): Myod1, Myf5, Myog, Myf6 – E-box motif over-represented (M04894, M02022, M04021).  
   • MEF2 family (Mef2a/b/c/d) – strong enrichment (M05392 highest z-score 4.4).  
   • SRF/TEAD cooperation (M07915, M08572) – supports actin-cytoskeleton gene activation.  
   • Six-family (Six1/4, together with Eya cofactors) and Pax3/7 motifs – consistent with early dermomyotome specification feeding into the module.  
   • FoxO/FoxK and PPAR/RXR nuclear-receptor motifs show secondary enrichment, reflecting metabolic maturation of fibres.  
   Collectively these factors comprise the canonical skeletal-muscle gene-regulatory network that converts somitic mesoderm into contractile myofibres.

Summary: Peak-cluster 32 marks the late-somite myogenic programme; it becomes highly accessible in developing trunk muscle from ~15 somites onward, orchestrated by MRF–MEF2–SRF/Six/Pax TF ensembles to drive sarcomere formation, fibre maturation and metabolic specialisation of skeletal muscle.

## Cluster 33

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 33 is a “Pax-module” that marks early neuro-ectodermal patterning domains and the nascent pronephric/kidney field.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at the 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf), rises further and reaches its maximum between the 10- and 20-somite stages (≈14–19 hpf), then decreases modestly by 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • Thus the cluster is most active during mid-somitogenesis, the window when regional identities of the neural tube, eye primordium and pronephros are being set.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest ATAC signal)  
   • Optic cup / eye field (optic_cup 10–20 somites ≈ 27–28)  
   • Midbrain-hindbrain boundary and hindbrain neuroepithelium  
   • Neural crest and differentiating neurons  
   • Pronephric duct / early kidney (pronephros 0–20 somites)  
   • Moderate signal in heart myocardium (reflecting Pax6/8 expression there)  
   Tissues of mesodermal muscle, epidermis or endoderm show clearly lower values (<22), underscoring neuro-/renal bias.

3. Regulatory programme implied  
   • Regionalisation of the anterior neural plate: eye field formation, optic-cup evagination, midbrain–hindbrain boundary specification.  
   • Patterning and epithelial morphogenesis of the pronephric duct and early kidney tubule.  
   • Early neural-crest specification and onset of neurogenesis.  
   • Gene list is enriched for adhesion/axon-guidance (pcdh, robo, slit), kidney transporters (slc22, abcc) and eye/brain patterning genes (rx, six, lhx), consistent with these processes.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
   Motif enrichment is overwhelmingly PAX-family (row 33):  
   • Pax2a/2b and Pax8 – master regulators of pronephros and MHB.  
   • Pax6a/6b – eye field and forebrain.  
   • Pax5 – overlaps with Pax2/8 binding specificity.  
   Supporting factors seen in adjacent enriched rows: Six3/6/7, Lhx2/9, Rx, and Ets/Meis–Pbx cofactors, which often cooperate with Pax proteins in eye and kidney enhancers.

In summary, peak-cluster 33 corresponds to cis-regulatory regions controlled by PAX proteins that co-ordinate early eye–brain boundary patterning, neural-crest/neurogenic programmes and initiation of pronephric kidney development during mid-somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 34

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 34 = “Neural-crest enhancer program”

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility already detectable at 0–5-som (10–12 hpf) but explodes at 10 som (≈13 hpf) and stays maximal through 15–20 som (14–16 hpf), then gradually declines by 30 som (≈19 hpf).  
→ Marks the window when premigratory crest cells delaminate, migrate and start early lineage specification.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest ATAC signal)  
• neural_crest: 8.9 → 19.3 → 39.6 → 43.0 → 41.6 → 30.7 (0→30 som) – an order of magnitude above every other pseudobulk.  
• secondary, weaker accessibility in immediate crest derivatives – enteric_neurons and tail-bud / PSM – consistent with cells that recently left the crest state.  
→ The cluster is virtually diagnostic for neural-crest cells.

3. Regulatory program inferred from associated genes  
Enriched gene set points to the classical neural-crest gene regulatory network (GRN) and its early derivatives:  
• Specification / multipotency: sox10, foxd3, tfap2, pax3/7, prrx1, zeb2a.  
• EMT & migration: adamts5/8/17, cdh6, itga8/9/11, itgb8, rho-GAP/GEFs (arhgap10/18/42, prex1), slit1b, sema6e.  
• Lineage priming  
  – Pigment lineage: mitfa, tfec, tyr, dct, slc45a2, slc24a5.  
  – Peripheral/enteric neurons & glia: phox2a/b, ret-signalling partners (gfra), cntn2/5, dner, ebf3, nrg3.  
  – Craniofacial cartilage: sox9a/b, col27a1b, col16a1.  
• Broad extracellular-matrix and cytoskeletal genes (col4a2, lama4, loxl1/2, fmn2, myo10l1) underscore motility.  
→ Function: drives neural-crest delamination, long-range migration and early lineage diversification.

4. Key transcription factors (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
Highly enriched motifs (Z-score ≥ 2) and co-expressed TF genes:  
• Sox family – Sox10, Sox9, Sox8/6/4 (strong SOX motif enrichment rows 1/35/61).  
• TFAP2 family – Tfap2a/c/e motifs present (row 101), classical crest specifiers.  
• Forkhead factors – FoxD3, FoxI3, FoxF2, FoxP2/4 motifs (rows 2/63/68/107); FoxD3 gene included.  
• MITF family – Mitfa / Tfec E-box–TFE motifs enriched (row 14), driving pigment programme.  
• Pax3/7 & Pax6/8 motifs (rows 7, 33, 54, 111) – early neural plate border factors.  
• Hox / Msx / Barx / Alx homeobox set (rows 34, 70, 84) – rostro-caudal patterning of migrating crest streams.  
• Ets factors (Fli1/Etv motifs rows 49–50) and AP-1 family (Jun/Fos, rows 64, 79) – cooperate in EMT and migration.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 34 comprises enhancers that open specifically in neural-crest cells as they leave the neural tube (10–20 som). It encodes the core neural-crest GRN, controlling EMT, migration and initial commitment to pigment, neuronal and chondrogenic fates, driven predominantly by Sox10/9, FoxD3, TFAP2, MITF/Tfec and Pax3/7 with patterning input from Hox/Msx/Barx homeoproteins.

## Cluster 35

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 35 represents a large set of regulatory regions that open very early and then close as tissues begin to differentiate.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at the 0-somite stage (10 hpf) and remains high through ~15–20 somites (~14–19 hpf).  
   • By 30 somites (≈24 hpf) accessibility collapses in almost every lineage (e.g. NMPs drop from 4.2 to 0.7; optic cup, tail-bud and many others fall to background).  
   → This is an early-embryonic / pre-organogenesis chromatin program that is switched off once organ-specific programs take over.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest signals are seen in pluripotent or multipotent progenitor domains:  
     – Neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs)  
     – Tail-bud / presomitic mesoderm (PSM)  
     – Early neural plate / spinal cord, hindbrain, midbrain-hindbrain boundary  
     – Early notochord and floor-plate  
   • Many other early lineages (endoderm, pan-neural crest, primitive muscle, endothelium) also show strong accessibility, but mature derivatives (e.g. pancreas, heart, optic cup) lose it first.  
   • Hence the cluster is pan-progenitor, with a bias toward neuro-ectodermal/axial progenitors.

3. Regulatory program and biological function  
   • Motif and gene composition point to maintenance of multipotency and early axial patterning:  
     – SoxB1/SoxF motifs (pluripotency, neural fate)  
     – Fox, Hox, Pax, Tbx, and Nkx motifs/genes (antero-posterior patterning, germ-layer allocation)  
   • Associated gene set is enriched for chromatin remodelers, signalling-cascade components (Fgf, Wnt, Bmp targets), and lineage “gate-keepers” (hox clusters, pax, fox, lin28a, dll, etc.).  
   • Together these peaks likely act as “primed” enhancers that keep key developmental genes permissive in early progenitors and are shut down once definitive tissue-specific programs begin.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   • Dominant: Sox family (Sox2, Sox3, Sox19a/b, Sox1a/b, Sox11, Sox21) – highest motif Z-scores in the cluster.  
   • Supporting regulators that frequently co-occupy early progenitor enhancers:  
     – Fox factors (FoxD3, FoxA/FoxC/FoxP)  
     – Pou-domain factor Pou5f3 (motif captured indirectly via Sox-Pou composite)  
     – Hox and Pax proteins (patterning)  
     – E2F/FOX-m1 (cell-cycle linkage) for rapidly dividing progenitors.  

In summary, peak-cluster 35 corresponds to a Sox-centred, broad “early-progenitor” enhancer program that is active from gastrulation to early somitogenesis across axial and neural progenitors and is globally shut down as zebrafish embryos transition into overt organogenesis.

# Peak Clusters Report

## Cluster 0_0

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 0_0 captures the chromatin program that turns on when neural progenitors begin to exit the cell-cycle and differentiate into functionally mature neurons.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at gastrulation/early somitogenesis (0–5 somites) and rises steeply from 10 somites onward, peaking at 20–30 somites (≈18–24 hpf).  
   • The progressive gain strongly parallels the appearance of electrical- and synapse-related transcripts (syn1, syt1a, sv2ca, cacna1bb, scn3b, nrxn2a/3b, tenm2, dscaml1).

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in:  
   • Differentiating neurons of the brain/spinal cord (largest signal, >10-fold above baseline by 20 somites).  
   • Enteric neurons (neural-crest derived) – early high signal (5–15 somites) that also plateaus at late stages.  
   • More modest enrichment in neural-crest pools and nascent presomitic mesoderm (PSM 30 somites), consistent with transient neurogenic competence there.  
   Non-neural tissues (muscle, endoderm, epidermis, heart, etc.) remain at baseline (~1).

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Gene and motif content point to a broad neuronal maturation module:  
   • Axon guidance / cell-adhesion: cntn3b/5, cntnap5a/l, dscaml1, pcdh15b, tenm2.  
   • Synaptic vesicle & neurotransmission: syn1, syt1a, sv2ca, cplx2l, rgs6, grin2bb.  
   • Ion-channel specification: cacna1bb, kcnh5a, kcnk10b, scn3b, abcc8.  
   • Activity-dependent plasticity / circadian components: nrg1, clock/ror/creb motifs.  
   • Thus the cluster marks the switch from progenitor to electrically active neuron and helps install regional (HOX/PAX/IRX) and lineage (SOX/NEUROD) identities.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + factor list)  
   • Pro-neuronal bHLH: NeuroD1/2/4/6, Atoh1/7, Olig2 – turn on neuronal gene battery.  
   • SOX family (SOX4/11/6/9, SOX10/21) – maintain neurogenic competence and aid differentiation.  
   • MEF2 (mef2ca/aa/ab) – synapse maturation and activity-dependent genes.  
   • RFX & NFAT motifs – ciliogenesis and Ca²⁺/activity-responsive programs in maturing neurons.  
   • HOX / PAX / IRX sets – impart anterior-posterior and regional neuronal identity.  
   • CREB/ATF/Jun–BATF (AP-1) and nuclear receptors (ROR/NR2F/NR1D) – underpin activity, circadian and metabolic coupling.

In summary, peak cluster 0_0 represents the chromatin signature of late neurogenesis and neuronal maturation, becoming most accessible during early organogenesis and predominantly in differentiating central and peripheral neurons, driven by SOX-, bHLH-, MEF2-, and region-specific HOX/PAX/IRX transcription factors.

## Cluster 0_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0_1 represents a pan-neuronal enhancer module that switches on when progenitors leave the cell cycle and begin terminal differentiation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises sharply from the 0- to 5-somite stage, peaks between 10–20 somites (≈14-19 hpf) and remains high through 24 hpf in most neuronal compartments.  
   • Enteric neurons show an early spike (0–20 somites) followed by a drop at 30 somites, indicating that this program is used transiently during early PNS maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Differentiating neurons (CNS) – strongest signal at every sampled stage.  
   • Enteric neurons – very high at 5–20 somites.  
   • Additional but lower enrichment in hindbrain, spinal cord, neural crest–derived neurons, midbrain–hindbrain boundary and endocrine-pancreas neuro‐endocrine cells.  
   (Most non-neural lineages remain at baseline ~2, underscoring neuron-specific activity.)

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Associated genes are almost exclusively neuronal: axon guidance/extension (UNC5C, TRIM67, BRSK2, LRRc4c, ROBO-like SDK1), synaptic vesicle and release machinery (SNAP25b, SV2, SYT9a, CPLX2), ion-channels/receptors (CACNA2D3/4, GRIA3b, GRID2, GABRB4, RYR3, NTRK1), RNA-binding/ splicing factors (RBFOX1/3), cytoskeleton (MYO16, MYO3A), and neuro-endocrine markers (CHGA, TRPM5).  
   Together they mark the transition from post-mitotic neuroblasts to electrically active, synaptically connected neurons; i.e. axon outgrowth, synaptogenesis and acquisition of neurotransmission competence.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene set)  
   • SOX family (Sox2/3/11/4/21) – maintains neurogenic competence and initiates differentiation.  
   • Proneural / bHLH factors (NeuroD1/4/6, Atoh1, Olig2, Ascl1) – drive neuronal fate and neurite extension.  
   • PAX6, ONECUT (Onecut1/2/3), LHX & DLX homeodomain factors – pattern-specific neuronal subtype identity.  
   • HOX, NKX, and PBX/MEIS – rostro-caudal positional codes, especially evident in spinal and hindbrain neurons.  
   • NFI (NFIX/NFIA) & NFI-related CTF motifs – promote maturation and gliogenesis timing.  
   • MEF2 & ROR/NR2F nuclear receptors – activity-dependent and circadian neuronal gene programmes.  
   • FOXP/FOXD/FoxG motifs point to FOXP1/2 and FOXG1 inputs important for neuronal circuit assembly.  

In summary, cluster 0_1 encodes regulatory regions that activate a conserved neuronal maturation program, peaking during mid-somitogenesis and most prominent in differentiating central and enteric neurons, orchestrated by SOX, proneural bHLH, PAX/ONECUT/LHX homeoproteins and MEF2/Nuclear-receptor modules.

## Cluster 1_0

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 1_0 captures a broad “late-somitogenesis differentiation” programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest and fairly uniform from 0- to 15-somite stages but rises sharply between 20- and 30-somites (≈ 22–24 hpf).  
• The increase is most obvious in 30-somite pseudobulks (e.g. Presomitic Mesoderm = 4.2 × mean, differentiating-neurons ≈ 1.5 ×, endocrine pancreas ≈ 1.6 ×).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Presomitic & somitic mesoderm → fast/slow muscle precursors, lateral-plate mesoderm.  
• Hindbrain & spinal cord neurons (differentiating-neurons, floor-plate, neural floor plate).  
• Cranio-facial/arch mesenchyme and optic cup derivatives show local spikes.  
Overall the cluster is most open in mesoderm-derived tissues that are segmenting or beginning terminal myogenic / connective-tissue programmes, with parallel but weaker activation in late neuro-ectoderm.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
• Very large set enriched for:  
  – Extracellular-matrix & cell-adhesion (multiple collagens, integrins, ADAM/ADAMTS, Tnc, Fbn2).  
  – Axon guidance / synaptic components (Cntn, Cdh, Nrxn, Grin, Gabbr, Slc12a5, Syt).  
  – Muscle contractile & Ca²⁺-handling genes (Myh11, Ryr1/2/3, Pvalb, Myl, Mef2 targets).  
  – Patterning factors (many Hox, Pbx, Meis, Barx, Dlx, Irx transcripts).  
These signatures point to late morphogenesis events: somite maturation into muscle/connective tissue, establishment of A-P (Hox) identity and wiring of nascent neural circuits.

4. Key transcription-factor motifs enriched  
(homeobox- and differentiation-driving factors dominate)  
• HOX paralogs (Hoxb1/2/3/4/5, Hoxc8/9/10/11/13, Hoxd9/10/11/12/13) – confer segmental A-P identity.  
• PBX / MEIS / PKNOX TALE cofactors – cooperative partners that sharpen Hox specificity.  
• DLX, BARX, IRX, PAX3/7 – regulators of cranio-facial mesenchyme, neural crest and muscle segment borders.  
• SOX (Sox5/9/10/11) & FOX (Foxd3/1/2, Foxi, Foxk) – maintain neural-crest, mesodermal and ectodermal programmes.  
• MEF2 & SRF motifs – activate muscle structural genes during myofibre differentiation.  
• GATA and RFX/Nuclear-receptor motifs (NR2F/COUP, RAR/RXR) – typical of late tissue maturation and ECM production.

Summary  
Cluster 1_0 marks regulatory regions that switch on late in somitogenesis, predominantly in presomitic/somitic mesoderm and late neuro-ectoderm, to drive Hox-guided patterning, extracellular-matrix remodelling and terminal differentiation of muscle and neural lineages. The motif landscape points to a HOX–PBX/MEIS–SOX/FOX regulatory hub, with MEF2/SRF fine-tuning contractile gene expression once myogenesis commences.

## Cluster 1_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 1_1 marks regulatory DNA that “switches on” as the embryo leaves segmentation and begins organ formation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest and almost uniform at 0–10 somites (10–16 hpf) but rises steadily thereafter, reaching its maximum at 20–30 somite stages (≈20–24 hpf).  
   • Highest values are seen in the 30-somite samples, indicating that the elements become most active during early organogenesis rather than during gastrulation/early segmentation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is confined to endoderm-derived tissues and their immediate derivatives:  
   • bulk “endoderm” pseudobulk (2.3-fold at 30 somites – cluster maximum)  
   • endocrine-pancreas lineage (1.55-fold)  
   • heart myocardium and fast muscle show intermediate signal; neuromesodermal progenitors, tail-bud, ectodermal neural tissues and epidermis are low or absent.  
   → The cluster therefore reports an endoderm/visceral organ enhancer set with some spread into closely related mesodermal organs (heart).

3. Predicted regulatory programme / biology  
   • Gene-body and expression links point to classical endoderm / gut / pancreas genes (pdx1, gata4/5/6, hnf4a/g, foxa/b/f family, rfx6, tal1, gata2/3, etc.) as well as metabolic and secretory genes (abca/abcb transporters, apoa/p, mucs, digestive enzymes).  
   • GO/process interpretation: specification and epithelial maturation of fore-/mid-gut, initiation of pancreatic endocrine programme, onset of organ-specific metabolism and extracellular-matrix re-organisation.  
   • Retinoic-acid / nuclear-receptor signatures (RAR/RXR, HNF4, PPAR) and pioneer-factor motifs (FOXA, GATA) suggest chromatin opening in response to RA signalling that licenses gut-tube and pancreatic enhancers.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + linked TF genes)  
   • Pioneer / opener: FOXA1/2/3, FOXC/F, FOXK (strong FOX motif block).  
   • Endoderm master regulators: GATA4/5/6, SOX17/32.  
   • Pancreas-specific: PDX1, RFX6, HNF1B, ONECUT1/2/3.  
   • Nuclear-receptor / RA axis: RARA/RARG, RXRα/β, HNF4A/G, NR5A1/2, PPARA/AB/G.  
   • Additional supporting factors: CEBP family, KLFs, MEF2 (heart overlap), and HOX/MEIS-PBX complexes reflecting anterior–posterior gut patterning.

In summary, cluster 1_1 represents a late-acting endoderm enhancer module that opens broadly across gut endoderm and peaks in the nascent pancreas, heart and other visceral organs at 20–30 somites, driven by a FOXA/GATA/PDX1/RA-receptor centred transcriptional circuit that orchestrates early organogenesis and metabolic maturation of internal organs.

## Cluster 1_2

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 1_2 in a nutshell

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at 0–5-somite stages (10–12 hpf) but rises steadily afterwards, reaching its maximum at 20–30-somites (≈20–24 hpf).  
   • This late-gastrula → early-organogenesis increase is seen in virtually every lineage that shows enrichment (see below), indicating that the elements in this cluster are switched on as the trunk and tail rapidly elongate and differentiate.

2. Cell-type specificity (top quartile of accessibility)  
   • Posterior paraxial mesoderm: presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and forming somites (PSM_30 s: 4.3; somites_30 s ≈ 4–5).  
   • Neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs) and tail-bud.  
   • Spinal cord / hind-brain neurons and differentiating neurons (values > 2.5–3 at 15–30 somites).  
   • Neural-crest derivatives – especially enteric, peripheral and optic-cup lineages (enteric-neurons_15 s 3.2; optic-cup 10–30 s 2.8–3.1).  
   • Pigment/melanocyte precursors show moderate but consistent accessibility (mitfa-positive lineages).  
   ⇒ The pattern is “trunk & tail”-biased and shared between mesodermal (somitic) and neural/neural-crest populations.

3. Biological programme represented  
   Gene correlations point to processes required for trunk patterning, axial elongation and peripheral-nervous-system assembly:  
   • Somitogenesis & myogenesis: pdgfra, tcf12, runx3, myl9, myo10l3, mark2a, mstn-related genes.  
   • Axon guidance / sensory neuron maturation: unc5c, unc5a, dcc, epha/b genes, piezo2, ryr2, cntn3b, cntnap5, lrttm4, zeb2a.  
   • Neural-crest specification & migration: sox10, prdm1b, zeb2a, ednraa, mitfa, tfec.  
   • A-P patterning: many posterior HOX motifs enriched, plus nr2f2, nr6a1/caudal-like cdx signatures.  
   • Circadian / metabolic maturation hints (arntl1b, per2, srebf1/2, fut8a) are typical of late-differentiating trunk tissues.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (top enriched motif families)  
   • Posterior HOX (Hox9-13) & CDX – set up trunk positional identity.  
   • SOX family (Sox10/9/5/4/21) – neural crest and neuro-mesodermal progenitors.  
   • PAX3/7 & DLX/IRX clusters – border-domain and neural-crest enhancers.  
   • FOX (Foxd3/Foxi/Foxc) – neural-crest and mesodermal axial elongation.  
   • RUNX3, NR2F2/COUP-TF, NR4A nuclear receptors – maturation of spinal sensory neurons & mesoderm.  
   • MITF/TFEC & BHLH (NeuroD/ATOH) – pigment cell and neuronal differentiation, respectively.  

Interpretation  
Peak cluster 1_2 contains enhancers that become progressively accessible as the zebrafish trunk and tail form.  They are shared by posterior paraxial mesoderm, neuro-mesodermal progenitors, spinal cord / hind-brain neurons and neural-crest derivatives.  The regulatory code combines HOX-CDX positional cues with SOX/FOX/PAX-mediated neural-crest and mesoderm programmes, driving late somitogenesis, neurogenesis and peripheral-nervous-system differentiation during 20–24 hpf.
]

## Cluster 1_3

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 1_3 – concise interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at the earliest stage we profiled (0-somite / 10 hpf) and rises further, peaking between 10- and 20-somites (≈13–19 hpf).  
   • Accessibility collapses by 30-somites (≈24 hpf), indicating that these elements are used during early, not late, organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • By far the highest signals occur in the superficial ectoderm:  
     – epidermis_0 – 20 somites = 8–11 (other tissues are ≤ 4).  
   • Moderate accessibility (≈3–4) is seen in enteric-neuron and somite pseudobulks, but this is secondary.  
   ⇒ Cluster 1_3 marks regulatory DNA that is specific to the early epidermis/periderm.

3. Regulatory programme implied  
   Gene set is enriched for:  
   • Epidermal barrier / periderm structural genes – tp63, krt92, lamc2/3, itga3/6/v, claudins (tjp2b), tgm2b, numerous collagens (col4a3/4, col11a1, col12a1), vcanb, smoc2, adamts proteases, ECM organizers (laminin, fibronectin-like).  
   • Cell-junction & polarity factors – pard3bb, patj, ctnna2, ctnnd1/2, pkp3, cadherin 24, claudins.  
   • Signalling molecules important for surface ectoderm (jag1a/b, wnt6b, pdgfc, epgn).  
   Biological processes therefore point to epithelial sheet formation, adhesion and extracellular-matrix remodelling that build the protective skin/periderm during gastrulation–segmentation.

4. Likely driver transcription factors  
   Motif enrichment and gene co-expression point to the canonical epidermal/periderm network:  
   • AP-2 family (TFAP2A/C/D) – highest positive motif Z-scores (M00111-113); Tfap2c gene present.  
   • p63 (tp63 gene in cluster, p53-family motif enriched – M051/x).  
   • Grainyhead‐like factors (grhl1/2) – GRHL motif group (row 44) enriched.  
   • IRF6 / IRF family – motifs enriched (row 21) and irf6 gene in TF list; cooperate with p63 in periderm.  
   • KLF/Sp and C/EBP family motifs (rows 86, 102) – epidermal differentiation/cohesion.  
   • GATA3/6 and TEAD/TA (rows 18, 82) – reinforce epithelial identity.  

Together these data argue that peak-cluster 1_3 comprises early-opening enhancers used by the periderm / surface epidermis during gastrulation–early segmentation, driven by an AP-2–p63–GRHL–IRF6 transcriptional module that activates genes for cell-adhesion, ECM deposition and epithelial barrier formation.
]

## Cluster 1_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 1_4 marks a mesoderm-derived, haemo-vascular transcriptional module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already above background at the 0–5-somite stages, rises sharply at 10–15 somites and reaches its maximum at 20–30 somites (note 8.5-fold signal in “hematopoietic / vasculature 30 somites” and 5.7-fold in “PSM 30 somites”).  
   • This timing coincides with the transition from vasculogenic specification (≈12–14 hpf) to active sprouting and maturation of the embryonic circulation (18–24 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in:  
   • Hematopoietic / vascular endothelium and hemangioblast clusters (4–8 log₂-units).  
   • Late presomitic/somite mesoderm (PSM 30 somites, somite derivatives), reflecting their shared mesodermal origin.  
   Moderate accessibility is observed in endoderm and fast-muscle but is clearly secondary to the vascular signal.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   Associated gene set is enriched for canonical endothelial / angiogenic / hemogenic regulators and effectors:  
   • Endothelial identity & sprouting – fli1a, erg/etv genes, flt4 (Vegfr3), esama/esamb, stab2, fgd5a, rock1, tlk1, tln1, cxcr3, robo1.  
   • Vascular ECM & lumen formation – fbn2a, hmcn1, fut8a, vwa8, stab2.  
   • Hematopoietic/immune priming – gata2/3, ikzf2, tal1-interactors (lcp2a, def6b), cd22, runx genes.  
   • Cell-cycle/proliferation components (E2F/Kdm2b module) consistent with rapid endothelial expansion.  
   Together these peaks describe the cis-regulatory landscape that drives vasculogenesis, early angiogenesis and emergence of hemogenic endothelium.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene presence)  
   • ETS family: Fli1/Elf/Etv/Erg motifs dominate – master switches for endothelial fate.  
   • FOX factors: Foxc1/2, Foxf1/2, Foxo1 – cooperate with ETS to activate vascular gene batteries.  
   • COUP-TF / NR2F (nr2f1/2/6) – venous/lymphatic endothelial specification.  
   • GATA2/6 and RUNX1/2/3 – hematopoietic competence of the endothelium.  
   • KLF2/6/9 and E2F1/2/3 – shear-responsive endothelial maintenance and proliferation.  
   • Supporting factors: MEF2C/CB (vascular maturation), TFCP2/TFEB/TFEC (endothelial metabolism).

In summary, peak-cluster 1_4 captures the enhancer repertoire that becomes progressively accessible during somitogenesis to establish and expand the embryonic vascular and hemogenic endothelial lineages, driven chiefly by an ETS-FOX-COUP-TF core transcriptional circuit.
]

## Cluster 1_5

[*assistant*:
Interpretation of peak-cluster 1 _5  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises steadily across the somitogenesis series and reaches a clear maximum at 20- to 30-somite stages (≈ 22–24 hpf).  
• Early gastrula/0-somite samples show only moderate signal; activity continues to grow rather than switching off, arguing for a role late in axis extension and early organogenesis rather than an early, transient burst.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest chromatin openness is seen in tissues that derive from the posterior paraxial mesoderm:  
  • Presomitic mesoderm (PSM), especially PSM_30-somites (13.8 – the global peak)  
  • Newly formed somites and fast-muscle myoblasts  
  • Neuromesodermal progenitors (tail-bud) show intermediate signal, consistent with their PSM bias  
Accessibility is low in neural, endodermal, epidermal and most differentiated neuronal populations, indicating the cluster is largely mesoderm-restricted.

3. Regulatory programme represented  
Gene bodies and co-expressed transcripts linked to the peaks are heavily enriched for:  
  • Hox paralog groups (hoxa1-13, hoxb/c/d clusters) – posterior axial patterning  
  • Segmentation/mesoderm factors: mespaa/mespab, tbx6/tbx16, tbx3, tbx18, tbx24, cdx1b/cdx4  
  • Early myogenic and extracellular-matrix genes (myhz2, lama1, loxl, col5a1/3, mmp11, adamts2/3)  
  • Retinoic-acid and RA-metabolism components (rarga/b, aldh1a2, cyp26 family)  
Together these point to enhancers that coordinate AP identity, segmentation and the first wave of myogenic differentiation in the trunk/tail.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
• Hox/Cdx code – Hoxa/b/c & Cdx1b/4 motifs dominate, matching the extensive Hox gene list.  
• T-box factors – Tbx6, Tbx16 and Tbx3 motifs; their RNAs are accessible and expressed in PSM/somites.  
• Fox family (Foxc1/2, Foxf1/2, Foxi, Foxj1) – classic regulators of paraxial mesoderm and somite epithelialisation.  
• RA-receptors (Rarg, Rxr, Rorb) – motifs and cognate genes enriched, consistent with RA-mediated Hox activation during trunk patterning.  
• MEF2 and MRF motifs appear but at lower accessibility, fitting the onset of myogenic commitment in older somites.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 1 _5 marks a regulatory module that switches on progressively during somitogenesis in posterior paraxial mesoderm, controlling Hox-driven axial identity, segmentation genes (Mesp/Tbx/Cdx) and the earliest myogenic/ECM programmes that shape the trunk and tail of the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 1_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 1_6 marks the “late-neuronal” chromatin programme

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low at gastrulation/early somitogenesis (0-10 somites ≈10–14 hpf), rises steadily, and peaks at 25–30 somites (~22-24 hpf).  
   • The sharp jump in differentiating-neurons from 2.7 (0 s) to 11.9 (30 s) and in most neuronal compartments (hindbrain, spinal cord, enteric- and optic-neurons) shows that the cluster switches on during the transition from neurogenesis to early circuit assembly.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Differentiating-neurons (all regional identities)  
   • Mature neuronal derivatives – spinal cord, hind-/mid-brain, optic cup, enteric and neural-crest neurons  
   • Moderate in other neuroectoderm-derived tissues (floor plate, neural crest) and late presomitic mesoderm, but low/absent in endoderm, epidermis or early mesoderm.  
   → The pattern is therefore pan-neuronal rather than lineage-restricted.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
   The 260 + associated genes are strongly enriched for neuronal maturation functions:  
   • Synaptic components & neurotransmission CACNA1/2/4, SCN8A, GRIA3, GRIK2, GLRA4, SLC18A3, RYR3, NPAS3, PRKG1, CAMK1D  
   • Axon guidance / adhesion LRRTM4, KIRREL3, NLGN4, PCDH clusters, CADM1, L1CAM, PLXNA3, EPHA7/B2  
   • Vesicle release RIMS2, CADPS, STXBP5, RPH3A  
   • Neuronal cytoskeleton & signalling MAP1AB, ANK3, DISC1, TRIM67, MTUS, MYO16, DIAPH3  
   • ECM remodelling for neurite outgrowth ADAMTS7, FBLN2, MMP24, SPARC-family, PGFB  
   GO/pathway enrichment (not shown) invariably points to “axonogenesis”, “chemical synaptic transmission”, “glutamatergic signalling” and “membrane depolarisation”.  
   → Cluster 1_6 therefore represents the chromatin module that licenses terminal differentiation and synaptogenesis of embryonic neurons.

4. Likely driver transcription factors (motif enrichment + gene list)  
   Motifs with highest z-scores map to four TF families that are all expressed in the linked RNA data:  

   • Proneural / bHLH NEUROD1/4, ATOH7, NEUROG2, OLIG2 (motif groups 15, 42) – activate neuronal differentiation genes.  
   • SOX-C/SOX-D SOX4/11/12, SOX5/6, SOX21 (groups 1, 35, 61) – maintain neuronal identity and open chromatin.  
   • TALE–homeobox / PBX-MEIS-HOX (groups 22, 25, 72) – regional patterning and axon-pathway wiring (PBX1/3/4, MEIS1/2, multiple HOX paralogues).  
   • RFX & RFX-like (group 58) – known regulators of late neuronal gene batteries including axon extension and ciliary genes (RFX3/4/6).  

   Supporting factors: FOXP1/2/4, NPAS3, KDM2B (present in gene list) and E2F-family motifs (group 6/13) that probably reflect a final wave of cell-cycle exit.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 1_6 is a pan-neuronal, late-developmental chromatin module that opens as neurons exit the cell cycle and begin axon outgrowth and synapse formation (20–24 hpf). It is most accessible in differentiating and newly born neurons throughout the CNS and PNS and is driven by a combination of proneural bHLH, SOX, PBX/MEIS/HOX and RFX transcription factors orchestrating neuronal maturation and connectivity.

## Cluster 1_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 1_7 represents the constitutively open “core-promoter / housekeeping” compartment of the zebrafish embryo.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at the first sampled stage (10 hpf; 0-somites) and remains uniformly high through 24 hpf (30-somites).  
   • Only a modest, gradual rise (≈ +10–15 %) is seen toward the end of somitogenesis (e.g. PSM-30 somites 5.2 vs ~2.5–3.0 elsewhere), indicating that these regions are active throughout but gain a little more accessibility as global transcription ramps up.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Virtually every pseudobulk shows strong accessibility (2–3 on the internal scale).  
   • No lineage shows exclusive enrichment; minor dips occur in very early fast-muscle and tail-bud pseudobulks, but accessibility quickly matches the embryo‐wide level.  
   • Conclusion: the cluster is cell-type universal rather than lineage-restricted.

3. Regulatory program / biological function  
   • The peaks map to, or correlate with, >6 000 genes that span metabolism, cell-cycle, translation, cytoskeleton, signalling and ubiquitous chromatin regulators—classical housekeeping sets.  
   • GO/KEGG Enrichment (from the gene catalogue) is dominated by:  
     – RNA processing / translation initiation  
     – Core metabolic pathways (glycolysis, TCA, lipid metabolism)  
     – DNA replication and repair  
     – Cytoskeleton and vesicle trafficking  
   • Together with the uniform accessibility, this indicates that cluster 1_7 comprises promoters (and some first introns/5′UTRs) required for basal cellular activity across all embryonic cells.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   • Motif landscape is broad but heavily enriched for factors that bind core promoters or are pioneer/ubiquitous:  
     – General promoter factors: NF-Y, SP1/SP2/SP3, KLF family, YY1, CREB/ATF, ETS (GABP/ELF/ELK/Fli), NRF-1/2, E2F + TFDP.  
     – Pioneer / architectural factors: CTCF, CXXC/KDM2, FOX(K/F/O), SOX (1/2/3/19), BACH/NFE2L, NRF (NR1/2 family).  
     – Basal transcription machinery: TBP/TBP-like (TBPL2), TFII-I (GTF2I), TFCP2.  
   • None of these are lineage-defining; they act collectively to keep promoters nucleosome-free and competent for transcription.

In summary, peak-cluster 1_7 is a genome-wide set of promoter-proximal elements that are constitutively accessible in virtually all cells from gastrulation through early organogenesis, supporting ubiquitous housekeeping gene expression rather than a lineage-specific developmental program.

## Cluster 1_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 1_8 marks the switch from generic trunk mesoderm to the highly patterned, posterior presomitic/somitic mesoderm that appears at the end of our sampling window.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is roughly baseline (≈1.3–1.6 a.u.) from gastrula through 20-somite stage, then jumps >20-fold at 30-somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • Thus the cluster is principally activated during the last stage assayed, coincident with late somitogenesis and tail elongation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • The spike is almost exclusively in Presomitic Mesoderm (PSM_30 somites = 25.9).  
   • Secondary, moderate accessibility is seen in fast-muscle, nascent somites and tail-bud mesoderm; most ectodermal/endodermal compartments remain low.  
   • Interpretation: the elements belong to the transcriptional program that distinguishes anterior/immature PSM from the posterior, segmentation-competent PSM and nascent somites.

3. Regulatory program inferred  
   • Associated-gene list and motif repertoire are dominated by:  
     – Hox paralog groups 9-13, Meis/Pbx cofactors → rostro-caudal axial identity.  
     – Tbx (Tbx6/16/18), Mesp, Uncx, Lbx, Lhx, Msx, Dlx → segmentation clock, anterior–posterior polarity of somites and myogenic lineage priming.  
     – Fgf/Wnt (Fgf11/12, Wnt4/6b), Notch effectors (Rbpj, Lfng targets) → signalling pathways that pace the segmentation oscillator.  
   • Biological processes therefore include posterior patterning, boundary formation, early myogenesis and extracellular-matrix remodelling necessary for epithelialisation of somites.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   • Posterior Hox code: Hoxa9-13, Hoxb5/6/8/9, Hoxc9-13, Hoxd9-12.  
   • TALE cofactors: Pbx1/2/3/4 and Meis1/2/3 (motif rows 22, 28).  
   • Segmentation/mesoderm TFs: Tbx6/Tbx16, Mesp-a/b, Uncx, Lbx1/2, Lhx2/9, Msx1/3.  
   • Forkhead contributors: Foxc1/2, Foxd3/5, Foxf1/2 (rows 2, 68, 107) – known to modulate paraxial mesoderm maturation.  
   • Ets/Runx and NF-Y motifs appear but are likely generic proliferation or chromatin-openness signatures at this stage.

In summary, cluster 1_8 corresponds to enhancers that become sharply accessible in posterior PSM at 24 hpf, orchestrating HOX-driven axial patterning and the segmentation/myogenic program that produces mature trunk and tail somites.
]

## Cluster 1_9

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 1_9 represents a large set of regulatory regions that behave almost like a “late differentiation – neuro-endocrine/epithelial” housekeeping module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already detectable at the 0–5-somite stages but rises further between 15- and 30-somite stages (≈ 20–24 hpf) in many lineages.  
• In early axial progenitors (NMP, PSM, tail-bud) accessibility progressively falls (e.g. NMP 0 som = 1.08 → 30 som = 0.21), whereas it continues to climb in differentiated tissues (neurons 0 som = 1.06 → 30 som = 1.38; endocrine-pancreas 0 som = 1.10 → 30 som = 1.38).  
→ The cluster therefore turns on during late somitogenesis, coincident with terminal differentiation and organ priming.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest values)  
• Differentiating CNS & PNS neurons (hind-/mid-/forebrain, spinal cord, optic cup, enteric & neural-crest derived neurons)  
• Endocrine pancreas and mature endodermal epithelium  
• Epidermis and floor-plate show moderate enrichment  
• Low or declining in mesodermal progenitors (NMP, early PSM, tail-bud)  

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
>  – Very strong enrichment for neuronal and synaptic genes: ionotropic / metabotropic glutamate receptors (GRIK, GRM), voltage-gated channels (SCN, KCN, CACN families), synaptic scaffolds (DLG, SHANK, NRXN, LRRTM, CTNNA2), axon guidance (SEMA, EPH/EPHRIN, ROBO/SLIT), neurotransmitter transporters (SLC18A1, SLC6A7).  
>  – Secretory / endocrine regulators (PDX1, PCSK2/6, RYR2, GIPR, INS-pathway genes).  
>  – ECM & cell-adhesion (multiple collagens, cadherins, integrins) supporting terminal tissue organisation.  
Together these point to a programme that underpins maturation of neurons and secretory epithelia (neuro-endocrine axis) and establishment of cell-cell communication interfaces (synapses, tight junctions, ECM).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif & gene co-expression)  
Highly enriched or co-expressed TF families that fit the temporal / cell-type pattern:  
• SOX family (Sox4/11/21, Sox2/3, Sox19) – neurogenesis and endocrine specification  
• FOX family (FoxG1, FoxD1/3/5, FoxP1/2/4, FoxA/F) – neuronal subtype identity, endoderm & secretory epithelium maturation  
• PAX (Pax2/6/7/8) and DLX/LMX/BARHL homeobox factors – regional neuronal patterning  
• MEF2 & SRF – activity-dependent neuronal genes and cytoskeleton  
• ROR/RXR/NR2F nuclear receptors – late neuronal/metabolic programmes  
• E-box & bHLH proneural factors (NEUROD, ATOH, OLIG) – terminal neuronal differentiation  
• KDM2B/CXXC1 (CpG island binder) hints this cluster is promoter-rich and broadly active.  

Overall, peak-cluster 1_9 marks promoter/enhancer elements that become most accessible as cells exit proliferation and finalize neuro-endocrine or epithelial differentiation during the 15- to 30-somite window, driven chiefly by SOX-, FOX-, homeobox- and nuclear-receptor TF networks.

## Cluster 1_10

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 1_10 corresponds to a late-segmentation chromatin program that turns on in trunk paraxial mesoderm just as the last somite pairs are laid down and myogenic differentiation is beginning.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest from gastrulation (0-5 somites) through mid-segmentation (10-20 somites) but spikes at the 30-somite stage (≈ 22-24 hpf).  
   • The >2-fold jump at PSM_30-somites (9.1 vs ~3–4 elsewhere) indicates a burst of regulatory activity immediately before the embryo leaves the segmentation period.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Dominant signal: Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) – especially the 30-somite pseudobulk.  
   • Secondary, lower-level accessibility in newly formed somites/fast muscle and in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs); negligible in endoderm, blood or ectodermal derivatives.  
   → Cluster therefore marks the paraxial-mesoderm lineage along the trunk axis.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Genes linked to the cluster include many hallmarks of somite patterning and early myogenesis: Hox (posterior A- & B-cluster members), mespab/mespaa, cdx1b/cdx4, tbx6/16, pax3/7, myod family, mef2 family, actn3b, myh7, etc.  
   • Enrichment for RA-receptor (RAR/RXR), Wnt/TCF–LEF, Notch/RBPJ, E2F and Mef2 motifs points to classical segmentation-clock and anterior-posterior patterning pathways, plus the switch from proliferation to differentiation.  
   • Biological processes:  
        – Setting anterior-posterior (Hox) identity of trunk somites  
        – Formation of somite boundaries (Mesp/Tbx6, Notch/RBPJ)  
        – Onset of skeletal- and fast-muscle gene expression (MyoD/Mef2)  
        – RA–FGF/Wnt gradient interpretation that terminates the segmentation programme.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   • Posterior Hox factors (Hoxb5/6/7/8, Hoxc8-13, Hoxd9-13) – A-P axial code.  
   • Tbx6/Tbx16 and Mesp family – segmentation clock & boundary formation.  
   • RAR/RXR (Rara/Rarg, Rxra/b) and Cdx1/4 – RA and posteriorizing signalling.  
   • TCF/LEF (Tcf7/7l1/7l2, Lef1) – canonical Wnt input.  
   • RBPJ-binding (Notch effector) – oscillatory clock component.  
   • Myogenic bHLH and Mef2 (Myod1, Myf5, Mef2a/b/c/d) – initiating muscle gene programme.  
   • Pax3/7 and Runx family – trunk muscle specification & tendon/ligament precursors.

In summary, peak-cluster 1_10 captures the chromatin landscape that equips late PSM cells to acquire their segment identity, form the last somite boundaries and immediately launch the trunk/fast-muscle differentiation programme.
]

## Cluster 1_11

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 1_11 corresponds to a germ-cell–specific chromatin module that “switches on’’ immediately after gastrulation and is largely confined to primordial germ cells (PGCs).

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility peaks at the 5-somite stage (≈11–12 hpf) and is already waning by 10–15 somites; a second, smaller shoulder is seen around 20 somites (≈19 hpf).  
   • Negligible signal is present at 0 somites and it falls back to baseline by 30 somites.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • The cluster shows an ~15-fold stronger signal in PGCs than in any other pseudobulk (28.5 in PGC-5 som vs. ≈1.7–2.3 elsewhere).  
   • Minor, broad accessibility across other tissues (1–2 a.u.) most likely represents basal/house-keeping promoter signal rather than true activity.  
   • No appreciable accessibility in differentiated somatic derivatives such as muscle, epidermis, or neural crest.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
   Enriched gene set is heavily biased toward germ-line and gonadal functions. Examples:  
   • Germ-cell identity / meiosis preparation: asz1, figla, dazl-like genes, dmrt1/2, tfap2c-like motifs.  
   • Steroid / lipid metabolism crucial for future gonad development: cyp11a1/2, acacb, acsl3, ppar-axis genes.  
   • piRNA / genome-protection machinery: tdrd-family–like (asz1), mael, prmt8, kdm2 family.  
   • Global transcription and RNA-processing factors (lin28a/b, kdm2, runx, fox family) that are known to be highly expressed in PGCs.  
   Together these point to a programme that maintains an undifferentiated germ-cell state, protects genomic integrity and sets up lipid/steroid provisioning for later gonadogenesis.

4. Likely key transcription factors (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
   • Nuclear-receptor cluster: NR5A1/2 (Sf1/Lrh-1), RAR/RXR, ESR, ROR – fits steroidogenic and lipid-metabolic gene set.  
   • GATA4/6 and FOXL2 – classic gonadal-somatic–cell and germ-cell regulators.  
   • DMRT (dmrt1/2) and RUNX3/1 – meiosis–initiation and germ-cell fate.  
   • AP-2 family (Tfap2a/c) and SOX17/19 – factors implicated in zebrafish PGC specification.  
   • KDM2/KDM5 & LIN28 – chromatin and RNA regulators enriched in the motif list and expressed genes, typical for proliferative PGCs.

In summary, peak-cluster 1_11 demarcates a burst of chromatin accessibility unique to primordial germ cells shortly after their specification, orchestrated by nuclear-receptor, GATA/FOXL2 and DMRT/SOX/AP-2 transcription factors to drive lipid/steroid metabolism, genome protection and maintenance of germ-cell identity.

## Cluster 1_12

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 1_12 – concise interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at gastrulation/early somitogenesis (0-10 somites), rises gradually, and peaks at 20-30-somite stages (≈18-24 hpf).  
   • The late boost is most pronounced in neural derivatives (differentiating-neurons, spinal cord, telencephalon, floor-plate, neural-crest) and in endocrine-pancreas, matching the onset of terminal differentiation and functional maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility ≈30 som)  
   • Differentiating / mature neurons across CNS & PNS (hind-/mid-brain, spinal cord, telencephalon, floor plate).  
   • Neural-crest–derived neurons (enteric, pharyngeal-arch).  
   • Endocrine pancreas (β/α-cell lineage) – fits the neuronal-like secretory gene set.  
   • Epidermis shows a transient spike (mainly at 20 som) but overall contribution is smaller.  
   • Mesodermal progenitors (NMPs, PSM, early muscle) and tail-bud lose accessibility, indicating the cluster marks a neural/endocrine rather than mesodermal program.

3. Putative regulatory program / biological processes  
   Gene catalogue is heavily enriched for:  
   • Neuronal excitability: voltage-gated Na⁺/K⁺/Ca²⁺ channels (SCN, KCN, CACN isoforms), neurotransmitter receptors/transporters (GABA, glutamate, monoamine), synaptic vesicle and active-zone components (SV2A, UNC13, RIMS, SHANK, SYNGAP, NRXN, NLGN).  
   • Axon guidance & neurite outgrowth (ROBO, UNC5, PLXNB, SEMA, NRN1, GAP43-like).  
   • Calcium-dependent secretory machinery (RYR, ITPR, SNAP-related) shared by neurons and pancreatic endocrine cells.  
   • Transcriptional/epigenetic regulators of late neurogenesis (NEUROD, NPAS3, MEF2, BACH, POU-/LHX-/PBX-/MEIS-families).  
   Overall, cluster 1_12 corresponds to the “neuronal / neuro-endocrine maturation” chromatin program that switches on once progenitors exit the cell cycle and begin functional specialization.

4. Key transcription-factor motifs enriched (drivers)  
   (motifs with consistent enrichment across the cluster and known roles in late neurogenesis)  
   • SOX family – Sox11/4/5/10/21: promote neuronal differentiation and neurite extension.  
   • PAX6 / PAX3/7 – patterning & neuro-endocrine identity (also crucial for endocrine-pancreas).  
   • LHX / LMX / TLX homeodomain factors – regional neuronal subtype specification.  
   • PBX/MEIS & HOX paralogs – anterior-posterior neuronal identity; PBX/MEIS cooperate with HOX in axon-pathway genes.  
   • NEUROD/ATOH/ASCL basic-helix-loop-helix factors – trigger terminal neuronal gene batteries.  
   • MEF2 & NFAT families – activity-dependent maturation, synapse stabilization.  
   • RFX (Rfx1-6) & ROR/NR nuclear receptors – ciliary/neuronal homeostasis and circadian neuro-endocrine genes.  
   • CREB/ATF/JUN (AP-1) – support activity-induced transcription during synaptogenesis.

Together, these data indicate peak-cluster 1_12 demarcates regulatory elements that become accessible late in development to drive the gene program required for electrically excitable, synaptically competent neurons (and neuron-like endocrine cells).
]

## Cluster 1_13

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 1_13 represents a very broadly-accessible set of regulatory elements that switch on soon after gastrulation and remain open in most differentiating tissues during early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low-to-moderate at the 0–1-somite stage, rises sharply by 5–10 somites (~11–14 hpf) and stays high through 15–20 somites (~16–19 hpf).  
   • In many lineages it declines modestly by 30 somites (~24 hpf); a notable drop is seen in the residual neuromesodermal progenitor (NMP) compartment (1_13 value drops from 1.9 to 0.3).  
   → The cluster therefore marks the broad “on-set of differentiation” window that follows axis-extension but precedes terminal maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility (values ≳2) is seen in  
   • Paraxial mesoderm & derivatives – PSM, emerging fast muscle, forming somites  
   • Lateral-plate mesoderm  
   • Endodermal derivatives – endocrine pancreas, gut tube  
   • Differentiating neurons (hindbrain & spinal cord), floor plate  
   • Early vasculo-haematopoietic mesoderm  
   Lowest values are found in very early muscle (0 som), late NMPs and late enteric neurons.  Overall, the cluster is active across all three germ layers, i.e. it is not lineage-restricted but is excluded from a handful of late progenitor niches.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   The overwhelming gene list (thousands of TFs, signalling receptors and metabolic genes) and the presence of almost every major developmental TF family indicate that 1_13 is enriched for promoter-type and large “pan-developmental” enhancers that:  
   • Drive body-patterning and regional identity (HOX, MEIS/PBX, PAX, NKX, IRX)  
   • Support multipotent lineage programmes (SOX, FOX)  
   • Integrate hormonal / metabolic cues (RAR/RXR, COUP-TF/NR2F, PPAR, VDR, THR)  
   • Couple differentiation with cell-cycle withdrawal (E2F, MYB, TEAD, MEF2).  
   In short, the cluster underlies the global transition from proliferating progenitor to specified, organ-forming cell, rather than a tissue-specific pathway.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs strongly enriched)  
   • FOX family (FoxA/C/D/K, FoxG) – pioneer factors that open chromatin for organ-specific programmes  
   • SOX family (Sox2/3/11/14/19, Sox9/10) – pluripotency and early lineage commitment  
   • HOX–PBX/MEIS complex – axial patterning, regional identity  
   • PAX proteins (Pax2/5/6/7/8) – neural tube, kidney, sensory placode specification  
   • NKX & IRX homeodomain factors – ventral CNS, endoderm and mesoderm patterning  
   • Nuclear receptors RAR/RXR/COUP-TF (NR2F), PPAR – retinoid & lipid signalling integration  
   • Cell-cycle/house-keeping factors E2F, YY1, ETS/GABP – promoter activity  
   • MEF2 & TEAD – muscle and general differentiation timing signals  
   • BATF/Jun/ATF, CREB/CREM – immediate-early response modulators.

Together these TFs create a ubiquitous but developmentally timed chromatin landscape that equips most embryonic cell types with the regulatory infrastructure required for early organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 2_0

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 2_0 marks a neural-crest/early peripheral-neuron regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already above background at gastrulation (0-somite), rises sharply during mid-somite stages (10–15 somites ≈ 14-18 hpf) and reaches its maximum in late embryos (30 somites ≈ 24 hpf) but only in specific derivatives (enteric neurons).  
• Summary: broad early opening, peak activity at 10-15 somites in migrating neural-crest cells, followed by maintenance/second peak at 30 somites in differentiating peripheral neurons of the ENS.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest scores)  
• Migrating / trunk neural-crest (10-15 somites: 11.8–13.4).  
• Enteric-neuron lineage (30 somites: 22.2 – the single highest value in the matrix).  
• Differentiating generic neurons, hind-brain & pharyngeal-arch NC, moderate signal in endoderm (gut tube) and hatching-gland; very low in mesodermal (somite/muscle) or ectodermal epidermis.  

3. Regulatory program inferred  
• Gene set is enriched for axon guidance and synaptic genes (ctnna2, cux1a, grin2cb, unc13b, snap25b), neural-crest/ENS determinants (ret, pvalb-like, cpne7), migration/ECM (itga3a, cdh22, lrp1ba, col27a1b), and RNA regulators (lin28b, adarb2).  
• GO/Pathway interpretation:  
  – Neural-crest specification → migration → differentiation into peripheral/enteric neurons.  
  – Early neuronal excitability & synaptogenesis.  
  – Minor contribution to cranio-facial (pharyngeal-arch) cartilage and gut endoderm interaction suggested by endoderm accessibility spike.  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & mapping)  
Highest positive motif z-scores and factor mapping point to:  
• SOX family (Sox10, Sox9b, Sox8/5/21) – core neural-crest lineage regulators.  
• FOX factors (FoxD3, FoxG1, Foxi and FoxP sub-families) – NC maintenance and neuronal differentiation.  
• PAX3/7 and TFAP2 – upstream NC specifiers.  
• HOX / PBX / MEIS cluster – rostro-caudal patterning of migrating NC.  
• PHOX2a/b and RET-responsive ETS factors (Fli1/Etv) – enteric-neuron differentiation.  
• Minor but significant E2F & MEF2 signatures reflect proliferative and later neuro-muscular cues but are secondary.

Together, the accessibility pattern, gene content and TF repertoire indicate that peak cluster 2_0 comprises enhancers that turn on in premigratory/migrating neural-crest cells, remain open as these cells colonise the gut, and drive the transcriptional programme leading to formation of the enteric nervous system and other peripheral neurons.
]

## Cluster 2_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 2_1 captures a late-acting neural-crest / cranio-facial regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is fairly uniform from gastrula up to 20-somites, but it spikes sharply at the 30-somite stage (≈ 24 hpf).  
   • The >10-fold jump in enteric neurons (20.4) and >40-fold in hatching-gland cells (49.4) indicates that most elements in the cluster are switched on only after the onset of organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility at 30 som:  
   • Enteric-neurons (neural-crest–derived gut nervous system)  
   • Hatching-gland cells (specialised secretory ectoderm)  
   Secondary but consistent accessibility (2.8-4.5) in: neural-crest, pharyngeal-arches, cranial mesenchyme, trunk neural plate, NMP/PSM. Thus the module is shared by neural-crest progenitors and the derivatives that emerge from them by 24 hpf.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Gene set is enriched for:  
   • Cranial cartilage / osteoblast differentiation – runx2a/b, sp7, matn1, col9a1b, mmp13, adamts3, flnb  
   • Axon guidance & synaptic genes – phox2a/b, lrfn, lrrtm, slitrk, cacna, grm/gria, nrg3, egflam  
   • Retinoic-acid & anterior–posterior patterning – large blocks of hox (a/b/c/d) genes, RAR/RXR motifs, alx, dlx, msx, barx, prrx, alx1/3/4  
   • Extracellular-matrix remodelling and secretory/enzymatic factors – furin, spint2, pdgf-c, mmp16, adamt-like, tgm1l1  
   Biological read-out: patterning and differentiation of cranial-neural-crest derivatives (enteric nervous system, cartilage, bone, secretory hatching gland), coordinated with retinoic-acid signalling and ECM maturation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (high motif Z-scores & present in gene set)  
   • HOX paralog groups 1-10 – positional identity along A-P axis  
   • DLX/MSX/BARX/ALX homeobox factors – cranio-facial skeletogenesis  
   • SOX10/SOX9/SOX5 – neural-crest maintenance & chondrogenesis  
   • PHOX2A/PHOX2B, PAX3/7 – enteric-neuron lineage specification  
   • FOX family (FOXD3/FOXF2/FOXC1) – neural-crest EMT, cartilage matrix genes  
   • RUNX2/SP7 – osteoblast maturation  
   • RAR/RXR/NR2F nuclear receptors – retinoic-acid response

Together, peak-cluster 2_1 marks enhancers that turn on at ~24 hpf in neural-crest derivatives to drive retinoic-acid-modulated cranio-facial cartilage/bone programmes and enteric-neuron differentiation, with SOX/HOX/FOX/DLX-MSX homeobox factors and RA receptors as principal regulators.
]

## Cluster 2_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 2_2 corresponds to a large set of enhancers that become progressively open in neuroectodermal derivatives as the embryo shifts from late gastrulation to early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises steadily from 0- to 30-somite stages (10 → 24 hpf).  
   • Early NMPs/PSM already show moderate signal, but the highest values appear at 15–30 somites, coinciding with the bulk of neuronal differentiation (differentiating-neurons: 7 → 21; enteric-neurons: 6 → 28; spinal cord, hind-/mid-brain, floor plate all climb >2-fold).  
   • Slight decline in NMPs after 20 somites indicates hand-off from multipotent progenitors to committed neural lineages.

2. Cell-type specificity (top accessibility at 30 somites)  
   • Neuroepithelial & neuronal: differentiating-neurons, spinal cord, hindbrain, floor-plate, neural crest–derived enteric neurons.  
   • Secondary but significant: somite derivatives (maturing muscle/somite pseudobulks) – reflects shared HOX/PAX code for AP patterning.  
   • Low in endodermal, epidermal or hematopoietic compartments.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Neuronal commitment, axonogenesis and synaptic maturation (supported by associated genes: cacna1c/2d3, gria/grin, nlgn/nrxn, robo1, nav2, ryr1a, snap91, syt1, ptprn2, ush1c, etc.).  
   • Anteroposterior and dorsoventral neural patterning – large cohort of Hox, Irx, Pax, Lhx, Dlx, Uncx, Onecut, Six genes in the “associated gene” list and motif table.  
   • Neural-crest–derived autonomic/enteric neuron development (sox10, phox2bb, gfra1a, plxna1/2, sema5a).  
   • Limited myogenic/fibro-axial genes (mef2, col2a1a, col28a2) explain the moderate somite signal.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (highest motif enrichment & matching expressed factors)  
   • SOX family – Sox10/Sox11/Sox21/Sox2: maintain neural progenitors and crest identity.  
   • HOX code – multiple anterior-posterior Hox motifs (Hoxb1-b5, Hoxa2/a5, Hoxd3/d4, Hoxc6/8/9/10/11/13) guiding segmental neuronal fate.  
   • PAX & IRX – Pax6/3/7 and Irx1/3/5 motifs support regional neural patterning.  
   • LHX/DLX/PHOX2 – motor-, interneuron and autonomic lineage determinants.  
   • FOX factors (Foxd3/Foxp4/Foxg1/Foxl1) – neural-crest and telencephalic programmes.  
   • MEF2 & E2F motifs appear but at lower cell-type-restricted levels (muscle maturation, neural cell-cycle exit).

In summary, cluster 2_2 marks a pan-neuronal enhancer repertoire that turns on as axial progenitors exit the cell cycle and differentiate, orchestrated by SOX-HOX-PAX/IRX-FOX homeodomain networks, with maximal activity in differentiating CNS and enteric neurons from 15 somites onward.
]

## Cluster 2_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 2_3 highlights a late, trunk-/tail-biased programme that turns on during the last wave of somitogenesis and accompanies differentiation of posterior mesoderm as well as neural-crest–derived enteric neurons.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest and fairly uniform from 0- to ~20-somites, but rises steeply at the 30-somite (≈24 hpf) stage.  
• The sharp late increase indicates that these regulatory elements are engaged once segmentation is essentially complete and tissues begin functional maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Somites (30 som)—highest signal of all pseudobulks.  
• Enteric neurons (30 som) — second-strongest peak.  
• Also above-average in fast muscle, differentiating neurons and epidermis at 30 som, but much lower in early mesoderm or anterior neural populations.  
=> The cluster therefore marks posterior paraxial mesoderm and its derivatives plus trunk neural-crest derivatives, rather than generic early mesoderm or anterior neural tissue.

3. Regulatory/biological programme inferred  
Associated genes are enriched for:  
• Cell-adhesion and ECM remodelling (TNC, COL9A3, COL12A1b, POSTNA, MMP17a, SGCD) – needed for myotome organisation and migrating crest cells.  
• Axon-guidance / neurite outgrowth (UNC5C, TENM2, SEMA3/4/5/6, CNTN5, CNTNAP5, NRXN1/3, NAV3, NPAS3) – consistent with enteric and spinal neurons wiring up.  
• Retinoic-acid and RA-catabolic genes (CYP26B1) and multiple RA-responsive ECM genes – fits late trunk patterning.  
• Skeletogenic / connective-tissue factors (RUNX2b, POSTNA, TNC) – future axial skeleton and tendon precursors.  

Taken together, the peaks appear to coordinate posterior segment maturation: myotome/myoseptum organisation, establishment of extracellular matrix, and wiring/migration of neural-crest-derived enteric neurons.

4. Likely key transcription factors (motif & gene evidence)  
Highly enriched motifs and the TF list point to three cooperating modules:  
• Posterior HOX + PBX/MEIS: strong motif over-representation for Hox (a9–c13 cluster) together with PBX/MEIS cofactors – classic drivers of AP identity and late somite patterning.  
• FOX family (Foxf1/2, Foxd3/5, Foxc1) — mesoderm/crest enhancers regulating ECM and migration genes.  
• PAX3/7 & SOX10 – hallmark regulators of trunk neural crest and early enteric-neuron specification.  
Supporting factors: RUNX (osteogenic), MEF2 (myotome/muscle maturation), TEAD (Hippo-linked growth), and NR/RA receptors (RAR/RXR) that couple RA signalling to the programme.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 2_3 represents a posterior trunk/caudal enhancer set that is switched on at the end of somitogenesis, is most accessible in somites and enteric neural-crest derivatives, and is driven predominantly by HOX-PBX/MEIS plus FOX and PAX/SOX factors to regulate ECM remodelling, neuronal guidance and musculoskeletal maturation.

## Cluster 2_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 2_4 marks a late-onset, posterior-neurogenic programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility stays at a basal level from gastrulation to ~20-somites, then rises sharply at the 30-somite/24 hpf stage.  
   • Biggest jump: tail-bud_30 som (75), NMPs_30 som (60), enteric-neurons_30 som (44), differentiating-neurons_30 som (11).  
   → The cluster is therefore most active during the last (early-organogenesis) time-point.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Tail-bud progenitors  
   • Neuro-mesodermal progenitors (posterior axial stem cells)  
   • Posterior / enteric-crest–derived neurons & differentiating spinal cord neurons  
   • Moderate signal in posterior somites and fast muscle, but low in anterior neural or endodermal derivatives.  
   Pattern = “posterior axis + late neurogenesis” rather than pan-neural.

3. Likely biological processes regulated  
   Gene set is strongly enriched for:  
   • Neuronal adhesion & axon-guidance (dcc, cadm4, nrcama, mdga1, brinp1, syne1b, shank2b)  
   • Neuro-transmission / excitability (grm7, gabrb2a, grin2db, kcnn2, kcnq3, gpr37b, tafa4b)  
   • Synapse assembly & plasticity (doc2b, srcin1, ripor1, smap2)  
   • Posterior ECM & basement-membrane components required for outgrowth (lama2, col9a1b, loxl3a, xylt1)  
   → Together they point to maturation of posterior neurons and establishment of long axonal projections emerging from tail-bud/NMP-derived neural tissue.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (top enriched motifs & matching factors)  
   • Posterior HOX / PBX–MEIS cofactors (Hoxb5/7/9/10, Hoxc8/9/10, Pbx1/3, Meis1/2/3) – specify caudal identity.  
   • SOX & FOX family (Sox10/11/12/14, Sox5/6/19; Foxd3/5, Foxa1/2, Foxf2) – maintain neural-crest/NMP competence and activate neuronal genes.  
   • PAX3/7 & IRX cluster – characteristic of tail-bud neural plate border and dorsal spinal cord.  
   • KLF/E2F motifs – consistent with continued proliferation of these progenitors.  
   • MEF2 / NFAT / CREB–ATF modules appear but at lower enrichment, fitting later synaptic maturation.

Interpretation  
Peak-cluster 2_4 represents regulatory regions that switch on at the end of somitogenesis to drive posterior-neurogenic differentiation. The programme is centred in tail-bud and NMP descendants, activating HOX-guided, SOX/FOX-supported transcriptional networks that establish caudal neuronal identity, axon guidance and synaptic-assembly genes required for wiring the emerging posterior spinal cord and enteric nervous system.
]

## Cluster 2_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 2_5 highlights the chromatin programme that switches on during late differentiation of the vagal-neural-crest lineage into enteric neurons.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is fairly uniform and low-to-moderate (log CPM ≈10-13) from 0-20 somite stages (10–22 hpf).  
   • A sharp surge occurs at 30 somites (~24 hpf): enteric neurons rise from ≈13 to ≈28.5, while all other cell types stay near baseline.  
   → The cluster is therefore maximally active only at the latest sampled stage, coinciding with the onset of terminal enteric-neuron differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest signals:  
   • Enteric neurons (strong, stage-dependent increase).  
   Moderate signals:  
   • Other neural derivatives (differentiating neurons, spinal cord, hindbrain) show only basal accessibility.  
   • Non-neural tissues remain at background.  
   → The pattern is highly specific to the enteric‐neuron lineage.

3. Regulatory/biological programme inferred  
   Gene set and motifs are enriched for:  
   • Autonomic/enteric neuron identity genes – Phox2a/2b, Hand2, Ret-pathway components, Gata2/3, Slit/Robo, Lhx2/4/9, Sox10, Elavl, Snap25, Syt2, etc.  
   • Neural-crest migration and differentiation factors – Sox10/9/6, FoxD3/FoxP1, PBX-MEIS-HOX patterning modules.  
   • Axonogenesis & synaptogenesis genes – Robo1/2/3, Nrp1, Gria/Grin/Gabra receptors, Snap25, Syt1/2.  
   • Cell-cycle exit/neuronal maturation – E2F down-regulation signatures, MEF2, NFAT, CREB/ATF.  
   Taken together, peaks likely mark enhancers that drive final specification, neurite outgrowth and circuit integration of enteric neurons.

4. Key transcription factors predicted to drive the cluster  
   • Phox2b / Phox2a – master regulators of autonomic and enteric neurons (motifs present; phox2ba/b genes listed).  
   • Sox10/Sox11 – neural-crest and neurogenic Sox factors.  
   • Gata2/3 – visceral neuron fate.  
   • Hand2 – sympathetic/enteric neuron differentiation.  
   • PBX/MEIS + HOX paralogs (especially posterior HOXB/C) – vagal axial identity of the crest.  
   • Lhx2/4/9, Tlx3 – neurotransmitter subtype specification.  
   • Fox family (FoxD3, FoxP1/4) – crest maintenance and neuronal subtype diversification.  
   • CREB/ATF & MEF2/NFAT – activity-dependent maturation.

In summary, peak-cluster 2_5 demarcates late-acting enhancers that are selectively opened in vagal-crest-derived cells as they commit to the enteric-neuron lineage, orchestrated by Phox2-, Sox10-, Gata-, Hand2- and PBX/HOX-centred transcriptional networks.
]

## Cluster 2_6

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 2_6 captures the cis-regulatory program that turns vagal / trunk neural-crest cells into mature enteric neurons during the second day of development.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is low-to-moderate through gastrulation and early segmentation (0-15 somites) and rises sharply after 20 somites, peaking at 30 somites (≈ 24 hpf).  
• This “late-on” profile fits the known timing of enteric-neuron differentiation, which begins only after neural-crest cells have reached the gut.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signal:  
 • enteric_neurons_30 somites (20-fold above baseline; by far the strongest value in the matrix)  
Moderate signal:  
 • differentiating central neurons, hind-/mid-brain and spinal-cord neurons  
 • epidermis and optic cup show mild accessibility but at ≈¼ of the enteric peak  
Thus the cluster is strongly enriched in the enteric‐neuron lineage, with minor promiscuous opening in some other neuro-ectodermal derivatives.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
The >1,500 linked/-correlated genes are dominated by:  
 • neuronal differentiation factors (RET, LMX1A/B, PHOX2B/PHOX2A, GDNF-receptor GFRA’s, EBFs)  
 • axon guidance / synapse genes (UNC13B, RIMS2, GRIN/GRIA/GRIK ionotropic receptors, KCNB2, KCNH2, SCN family Na⁺ channels, SNAP91)  
 • neurotransmitter specification (GABRB2, NT receptors, PLCB1/4, NPAS3, NPFFR2)  
 • ENS-specific markers (PHOX2B, PHOX2A, RET, GFRα1/2, LHX family, HOXB1/2/3 with PBX/MEIS cofactors)  
GO-term enrichment (not shown but evident from gene list): neurogenesis, synaptic signalling, axonogenesis, enteric nervous-system development.

4. Key transcription-factor motifs (drivers)  
Motif enrichment and TF-mapping point to a canonical ENS specification module:  
 • SOX10 / SOX8/9 – maintains neural-crest identity as cells migrate into the gut  
 • PHOX2B / PHOX2A – master regulators of autonomic & enteric neuron fate; motifs and genes present  
 • GATA2/3 – cooperate with PHOX2B in cholinergic ENS neurons  
 • HOX-PBX-MEIS cassette (HOX-B cluster, PBX1/3/4, MEIS1/2/3, PKN OX) – axial/vagal identity of ENS precursors  
 • LHX/LBX/UNCX and EBF family – terminal neuronal differentiation  
 • FOXD3 / FOXF2 / FOXL2 – early neural-crest & gut mesenchyme interaction  
 • Moderate E2F/MEF2 signal reflects residual cell-cycle activity and neuronal maturation, respectively.

Taken together, peak cluster 2_6 marks the late-segmentation opening of enhancers driving enteric-neuron specification and maturation, controlled primarily by the SOX10 → PHOX2B / GATA → HOX-PBX-MEIS cascade.

## Cluster 2_7

[*assistant*:
Peak Cluster 2_7 – Summary Interpretation

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest during early segmentation (0–10 somites) but rises steeply after 15 somites and reaches a maximum at 20–30 somites (≈ 19–24 hpf).  
   • This profile fits the onset of tissue-specific differentiation that characterises early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest average accessibility)  
   1. Enteric neurons ≫ (peaks at 30 somites, 26 a.u.)  
   2. Heart myocardium (10–30 somites, 13–16 a.u.)  
   3. Differentiating/ mature neurons (brain & spinal cord)  
   4. Endocrine pancreas progenitors  
   5. Fast muscle (briefly high at 0 somites)  
   => The cluster marks neuronal-crest derivatives and lateral-plate/ cardiogenic mesoderm that are rapidly maturing at these stages.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
   • Cardiogenesis / contractile apparatus: tnnt2a, myh7l, myl4, acta2, mef2-responsive sarcomeric genes, bmp6/7b, tbx5a, gata4/5/6.  
   • Neuronal differentiation & axon guidance: gap43, ntn1a, slit3, nrp1a/2a, ephb2a, sema3/6, gabra3, gria4a, foxp2, phox2a/b (autonomic & enteric lineage markers).  
   • Endocrine-pancreas / gut tube morphogenesis: abcc8, pdgfrb, wt1a, ccbe1, itga8.  
   • ECM & vascular support: adamtsl3, mmp24, tgfbr3, pdgfrb.  
   Together these genes define enhancer sets that drive late-stage organ formation of heart muscle, enteric nervous system, brain/spinal neurons and pancreatic endocrine tissue.

4. Key transcription factors enriched (motifs & gene list)  
   • Mef2 family (Mef2a/b/c/d) – master regulators of cardiac and fast-muscle gene expression.  
   • T-box factors: Tbx5/Tbx20 – cardiac chamber specification.  
   • Gata factors (Gata4/5/6 in heart; Gata3 in enteric neurons/pancreas).  
   • Sox / Fox combinatorial network (Sox10/5/9, FoxD/FoxP/FoxG) – neural-crest and neuronal maturation.  
   • Phox2a/b & Neurogenic bHLH (NeuroD/ Atoh1) – autonomic & sensory neuron programmes.  
   • Nuclear-receptor cluster (RAR/RXR, COUP-TF/Nr2f) – consistent with retinoic-acid–dependent patterning during organogenesis.  
   • Ets/Runx and Mef2 motifs support concurrent vasculature and osteo-mesenchymal components.

Conclusion  
Peak cluster 2_7 corresponds to a late-segmentation/early-organogenesis enhancer module that becomes highly accessible in developing enteric neurons, myocardium and other neural/mesodermal derivatives.  It integrates Mef2-/Tbx-/Gata-driven cardiogenic control with Sox/Fox/Phox-centred neurogenic programmes, under modulation by retinoic-acid nuclear receptors, thereby coordinating maturation of heart, nervous system and allied endodermal organs.

## Cluster 2_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 2_8 marks a haemato-vascular/vasculature-associated cis-regulatory program that turns on during mid-segmentation and peaks by early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at 0-5 somites (~10–12 hpf), begins to rise at 10–15 somites, and reaches a clear maximum at 20–30 somites (≈19–24 hpf).  
   • This timing coincides with the emergence of hemangioblasts (10 som) and the explosive expansion/maturation of endothelial and early blood lineages (20–30 som).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Hemangioblasts (7.6 → 11 logCPM, 5→30 som).  
   • Haematopoietic / vascular endothelium (8.5 → 16.7 logCPM, 0→20 som).  
   • A late, very strong signal in enteric-neurons at 30 som (21.6 logCPM) suggests re-use of the same regulatory set by migrating neural-crest-derived enteric precursors, which often follow blood vessels.  
   • Basal accessibility (3–5 logCPM) is observed in many mesodermal/neural populations but never approaches the haemato-vascular levels.

3. Inferred biological processes  
   • Specification of hemangioblasts and transition to endothelial and haematopoietic fates (angioblast migration, vasculogenesis, primitive/definitive haematopoiesis).  
   • Vascular-associated signalling (Tie1/Tal1, PDGF-D, TGF-βR2, BMP8a, G-protein–coupled receptors, GATA-RUNX axis).  
   • Secondary deployment in enteric-neuron development, consistent with vascular-guided neural-crest migration.

4. Key enriched transcription-factor modules driving the cluster  
   • ETS family: Fli1, Erg, Etv2/Etv5 – core endothelial activators.  
   • GATA factors: Gata2/3/5/6 – essential for early blood and endothelium.  
   • RUNX factors: Runx1/2/3 – haematopoietic commitment.  
   • TAL1/SCL & co-factors (Tal1, Meis/Pbx) – hemangioblast specification.  
   • Nuclear-receptors (Rar/Rxr, Nr2f/COUP-TF, PPAR) – retinoid and lipid signalling that pattern vessels.  
   • MEF2 family – maturation/remodelling of vascular smooth muscle/endothelium.  
   • FOXC/FOXF/FOXO – endothelial migration and arterial-venous identity.  
   • Late neural-crest/enteric usage reflected by HOX-PBX-MEIS and SOX10/SOX21 motifs.

Taken together, cluster 2_8 represents enhancers that orchestrate the mid-to-late segmentation wave of hemangioblast specification, endothelial/blood differentiation and, at later stages, the vascular-associated development of enteric neurons.
]

## Cluster 2_9

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 2_9 marks a neural-lineage cis-regulatory program that is reused at two developmental windows.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• First wave – 0-5 somite stage (~10-12 hpf): very high accessibility in the optic-cup/eye-field pseudobulk (optic_cup_0 somites ≈ 42; optic_cup_5 somites ≈ 3.7 vs baseline ≈ 3).  
• Second wave – 20-30 somite stage (~22-24 hpf): accessibility rises steadily in neural-crest–derived enteric neurons (enteric_neurons 20 somites ≈ 4.4, 30 somites ≈ 20) and remains high in differentiating neurons of the spinal cord/hind-brain.  
→ The cluster is transiently open during early anterior neural plate patterning, closes during mid-somite stages, and re-opens during late neurogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signal:  
• Optic cup / retinal progenitors (early)  
• Enteric neurons (late)  
Moderately high: hindbrain & generic “differentiating_neurons”, floor-plate, spinal-cord.  
Very low in mesoderm, endoderm, epidermis and non-neural crest tissues.  

3. Regulated biological processes  
Gene and motif content point to:  
• Eye-field specification, optic-vesicle morphogenesis, photoreceptor/RPE priming (rx1/3, pax6a/b, vsx1, crx, otx1/2, mitfa/tfec).  
• Neural-crest migration and enteric nervous-system assembly (sox10, phox2a/b, gfra4a, vip, vipr2, hand2, ret‐co-receptor genes).  
• Generic neuronal differentiation – axon guidance (cntnap5, robo/ slit genes), synaptogenesis (nrxn1/2, gria/grin), neurotransmitter synthesis & signalling (vip, vipr2, dbh, adcyap1b).  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (enriched motifs & expressed factors)  
Eye/optic-field phase: Pax6, Rx (rx1/3), Six3/6, Otx1/2, Vsx1, Crx, Mitf/Tfec, Sox2/3/19.  
Neural-crest / enteric phase: Sox10, Phox2a/Phox2b, Pax3/7, Lhx2/4/9, Dlx family, Hand2, Foxd3/Foxl1.  
Pan-neural support: Sox11, Sox4, NeuroD/NeuroG bHLH factors; Rfx, Klf/Sp and E2F clusters (cell-cycle exit of neural progenitors).

Taken together, peak cluster 2_9 contains enhancers that first instruct anterior neural plate cells to adopt optic-cup identity and later are re-deployed in neural-crest derivatives to drive enteric-neuron maturation, illustrating the temporal reuse of a common neurogenic regulatory module in zebrafish embryogenesis.
]

## Cluster 2_10

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 2_10 captures a small set of regulatory elements that open very strongly in a narrow group of secretory endodermal derivatives and are re-used later by maturing enteric neurons.  
Below is a concise summary of the main observations.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises already at 0-5 somites, peaks at 10-15 somites (≈14-19 hpf) and then falls in most tissues.  
• A second wave appears at 30 somites (≈24 hpf) specifically in the enteric-neuron lineage.  
→ two activity peaks: early-mid somitogenesis in endoderm-derived hatching-gland/thryoid field, and late somitogenesis in differentiating enteric neurons.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility values)  
• Hatching-gland cells 13–18 (0-20 som) – highest of all pseudobulks.  
• Enteric neurons ~20 (30 som) – late, lineage-specific re-use.  
• Moderate opening (3-6) in other pharyngeal/endodermal compartments: generic endoderm, endocrine-pancreas, floor plate / differentiating neurons.  
• Very low in mesoderm, ectodermal epidermis or muscle.

3. Implied regulatory programme  
Associated gene set is enriched for:  
• Secretory/vesicle and neuroendocrine components – cadps2, pcsk2, cpe, rab2a, vipr1b, tg (thyroglobulin).  
• Ion-handling and excitability genes – RYR2, KCNK12, SCN2B, SLC12A5b, GRIA4a/GRID1a/GRIK1a.  
• ECM-remodelling / protease genes – adamts3, adra1aa, thbs4b, scube3.  
• Pharyngeal/thyroid and digestive-tract markers – tgfb2, ebf3a, lrp8, unc5c.  

Together these point to a programme that equips (i) hatching-gland cells with the machinery needed for enzyme secretion that dissolves the chorion and (ii) early enteric neurons with synaptic/secretory competence.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene list convergence)  
Highly enriched motifs correspond to, and the cluster contains transcripts for, the following TF families:  
• FOX (foxa1/3, foxd1/3/5, foxf1/2, foxl1/2) – pioneer factors for endoderm and secretory-gland programmes.  
• GATA (gata4/5/6, gata2/3) – maturation of fore-gut endoderm including thyroid primordium.  
• SOX (sox2/3/4/9/10) – maintenance of epithelial-secretory identity and later neural differentiation.  
• PAX & NKX2 (pax2a/8, nkx2-1/2-4/2-5) – pharyngeal/thyroid patterning.  
• PBX/MEIS & DLX/LHX homeobox factors – neural-crest-derived enteric neuron maturation.  
• Nuclear receptors (RXR/RAR/NR2F family) – retinoid signalling that patterns the anterior endoderm.  

In summary, peak cluster 2_10 defines a fore-gut endoderm/secretory-neuroendocrine chromatin module that is maximally open in hatching-gland cells during mid-somitogenesis and is re-deployed by enteric neurons at 24 hpf, driven primarily by FOX-, GATA- and homeobox/NKX/PAX family transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 2_11

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 2_11 captures a posterior body-plan/enteric-neuron transcriptional module that first appears in axial progenitors and paraxial mesoderm, is maintained in differentiating muscle, and culminates in enteric neurons.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Low–moderate accessibility at 0–5-somite stages.  
   • Rises during segmentation (10–20 somites) in NMPs and PSM.  
   • Maximal at 30-somite / 24 hpf, driven almost entirely by a dramatic spike in enteric-neurons (≈27 logCPM), while accessibility in mesodermal derivatives (somites, fast-muscle) remains high but stable.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest to lower)  
   • Enteric neurons (especially 30 som) – dominant signal.  
   • Presomitic mesoderm & tail-bud axial progenitors.  
   • Developing somites / fast-muscle fibres.  
   • Moderate in neural-crest, hindbrain & spinal-cord populations; low in endoderm/epidermis.

3. Implied regulatory programme / biological processes  
   • Anterior-posterior trunk patterning & segmentation (dense enrichment of posterior HOX, PBX/MEIS, Cdx signatures; her7, spaw, wnt5b genes).  
   • Myogenic differentiation & sarcomere assembly (myog, myl1, mybpc1, mef2 motifs).  
   • Neural-crest migration and enteric-nervous-system neurogenesis (sox10, phox2a/b motifs; neurod1, unc5c, robo1, slc18a3a, slc17a7a genes).  
   • Axon guidance / synaptogenesis (tenm2, slitrk2, grm7, grin2d, syt1).  
   • ECM & cell-adhesion remodelling (cdh4/18, do ck4, lama/col genes) required for gut colonisation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched and/or corresponding genes in cluster)  
   • Posterior HOX paralogs (Hoxb5-b13, Hoxc8-c13, Hoxd9-d13) with PBX/MEIS/TGIF cofactors – set trunk positional identity.  
   • SOX10 / SOX5 / SOX9 – neural-crest maintenance and gliogenesis.  
   • PHOX2A / PHOX2B & GATA3 – specify enteric cholinergic neurons.  
   • PAX3 / PAX7 & NKX family – trunk neural-crest and somitic mesoderm competencies.  
   • MEF2, MyoD/Myog – myogenic programme co-active in somites/fast muscle.  
   • FOX (Foxd3, Foxc1/2, Foxl1) – mesoderm & neural-crest migration.  
   • Nuclear receptors RAR/RXR/COUP-TF (nr2f, rarg, rxr) – retinoid-controlled AP patterning.  

Together these features indicate that peak-cluster 2_11 marks regulatory elements that hand off from early posterior axial/mesodermal patterning to late enteric-neuron differentiation, coordinating trunk segmentation, myogenesis and colonisation of the gut by neural-crest-derived neurons.
]

## Cluster 2_12

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 2_12 marks an ectoderm-derived lineage stream that starts in surface ectoderm, is reused in migrating neural-crest cells and remains highly open in their enteric-neuron progeny.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Earliest activity (0–10 somites, 10–14 hpf) – already high.  
   • Plateau/slow rise through mid-somite stages (15–20 somites).  
   • Sharp late surge at 30 somites (≈24 hpf) – 2- to 3-fold jump driven almost entirely by enteric-neuron pseudobulks.  
   Interpretation: elements are established early and retained, but are maximally deployed when crest-derived cells terminally differentiate into the enteric nervous system during early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Enteric neurons ≫ all other cell types (8–23 × above background, strongest at 30 somites).  
   • Surface ectoderm / epidermis shows conspicuous accessibility during 0–20 somites.  
   • Neural-crest clusters and differentiating neurons show intermediate levels.  
   • Mesodermal, endodermal or muscle derivatives are low.

3. Implied regulatory programme  
   Gene set is enriched for:  
   • Neural-crest migration & EMT – zeb2a, foxd3/foxf2, stk17b, itga4/itga8, lama5, col7a1, cdh4, edar.  
   • Enteric neurogenesis / peripheral synaptogenesis – phox2a/b motifs, grin2a/b, grm5b/8a, rbfox1/3, shank1/2b, nrxn2a, ngfrb, ebf1b, nrg3b.  
   • Axon guidance & ECM remodelling – tenm2, ryk, sema3bl, sdk1/2, pxna, bmpr2a, wnt10a.  
   • Epidermal differentiation components (krt5, abcc4) reflect early surface-ectoderm use.  
   Overall, the cluster encodes enhancers that drive:  
   • Induction/migration of neural-crest cells,  
   • transition into the enteric lineage, and  
   • maturation of enteric neurons and their synaptic machinery.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif & gene co-enrichment)  
   Early crest / ectoderm: Tfap2 (AP-2), Sox10/SoxE group, Pax3/7, Tfcp2, Tfap4.  
   Crest-to-enteric transition: Fox family (FoxD3, FoxC1/I3, FoxL1), Sox4/11, Hox paralogs (Hoxb1/a2 cluster) and Dlx/Barx factors mediating axial identity.  
   Terminal enteric neuron specification: Phox2a/2b, Lhx2/4/9, Pbx–Meis (Hox cofactors), Ebf1/3, Runx1/3.  
   Modulators of proliferative burst: E2F1/2/3/4 and Klf family (Klf2/9/12/17).  
   Nuclear-receptor motifs (Nr2f, Rorb, Esrr) likely tune maturation and metabolic programmes.

Together, the accessibility profile, gene content and TF motif landscape point to peak-cluster 2_12 as an enhancer set that scaffolds the progressive specification of neural-crest-derived enteric neurons, with early deployment in epidermal/crest progenitors and maximal utilisation during enteric neuronal differentiation around 24 hpf.
]

## Cluster 2_13

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 2_13 marks a regulatory module that turns on late and is heavily biased toward posterior axial / trunk lineages.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest and fairly uniform from gastrulation (0 som) through 20 somites (~19 hpf) but shows a sharp spike at the 30-somite stage (~24 hpf).  
   • The dramatic jump (∼7-fold higher than baseline) is most evident in the 30-somite sample, indicating that the cis-elements in this cluster become fully open only in the latest time point assayed.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Presomitic mesoderm (PSM_30 somites) is the standout population (accessibility z-score ≈ 21 vs ≈ 3–5 elsewhere).  
   • Secondary but consistent accessibility is seen in:  
     – Neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs)  
     – Newly forming somite-derived muscle (fast/muscle, generic “muscle”, somites)  
     – Posterior neural derivatives (differentiating neurons, spinal cord, neural crest, enteric neurons).  
   • Together, the pattern points to cell types that arise from the posterior paraxial mesoderm and adjacent neuro-epithelium.

3. Implied regulatory programme / biology  
   • Posterior axial patterning and segmentation (somitogenesis) – presence of many Hox A/B/C/D paralogs, Meox1/2, Uncx, Msx/Dlx, Tbx family genes.  
   • Transition of PSM to epithelial somite and myotome (genes such as Meox, Lbx, Pax3/7, MyoD/ Myf5 targets).  
   • Concurrent specification of trunk neural identities – enrichment of Lhx, Phox2, Dmbx, Otx, Irx, Six classes and numerous neuronal receptor/channel genes (Grik2, Ryr2, Gabr genes).  
   • Hence the cluster appears to coordinate the late “trunk module” that simultaneously patterns mesodermal somites and posterior neuronal cell types.

4. Likely driver transcription factors (motifs highly enriched & matching expressed TFs)  
   • Posterior Hox factors – hoxc8/9/10/11/13, hoxa9/10/11, hoxb5/7/8: provide positional code along the A-P axis.  
   • Fox class I/ C/ D (Foxc1, Foxd1/3/5, Foxf2, Foxa) – integrate mesodermal and neural patterning signals.  
   • Nkx & Tbx homeodomain factors (Nkx1/2, Tbx6/16/18/20) – core regulators of PSM identity and segmentation clock output.  
   • Pax3/7 and Lbx/Lhx families – specify dermomyotome, migrating muscle progenitors and spinal interneurons.  
   • Dlx/Msx & Meis/Pbx cofactors – cooperate with Hox proteins to activate posterior somite and neural enhancers.  
   • E2F/TFDP and Mef2 motifs are also enriched, suggesting a link to late cell-cycle exit and initiation of muscle-specific transcription.

In sum, peak cluster 2_13 represents the late-acting enhancer set that establishes posterior (tail/trunk) identity, driving final segmentation of the presomitic mesoderm into somites and parallel maturation of trunk spinal/neuronal lineages through a Hox-Fox-Nkx/Tbx-Pax interplay.

## Cluster 2_14

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 2_14 marks a very selective, late-acting neuronal programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is fairly modest (≈6–7 AU) in most lineages from gastrula to 20-somite stages, but it jumps dramatically to 23.4 AU at 30-somites.  
   • Interpretation: the cis-regulatory module becomes fully active only around 24 hpf (late segmentation / early organogenesis).

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • The spike occurs almost exclusively in “enteric_neurons 30 somites”.  
   • No other cell type exceeds background by >1 AU, except a mild enrichment (7.8 AU) in primordial-germ-cells 0–5 somites, which is likely noise or reflects a small shared enhancer subset.  
   → Cluster 2_14 is essentially an enteric-neuron-specific peak set.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Correlated/overlapping genes include canonical enteric-neuron factors (PHOX2A/2B, TLX1/2/3, LMX1A/B, HOXB1/B5/B7/B9, MEIS/PBX cofactors, SOX10, RET-pathway partners GFRA1/2, GDNF-axis ligands, etc.).  
   • Functional themes:  
     – Vagal-neural-crest migration into gut and ENS colonisation.  
     – Rostro-caudal positional identity via HOX-PBX-MEIS code.  
     – Neuronal differentiation (neurogenin/neuroD, ASCL1, RFX, MEF2, RUNX).  
     – GDNF/RET signalling, axon guidance (ROBO/SLIT, EPH/EFN), synaptogenesis.  
   • Therefore the cluster represents enhancers driving terminal differentiation and regional patterning of enteric nervous-system neurons.

4. Likely driver transcription factors (supported by motif enrichment & gene lists)  
   • HOX/PBX/MEIS triad – provides axial code (HOXB1/B5, PBX3/4, MEIS1/2/3).  
   • PHOX2A / PHOX2B – master regulators of autonomic and enteric neurons.  
   • TLX2 / TLX3, LHX2/9 – specify glutamatergic/cholinergic ENS subtypes.  
   • SOX10, FOXD3 – residual neural-crest identity and glial competence.  
   • GATA3, RUNX1/3 – neurotransmitter and subtype specification.  
   • RFX3/4 and MEF2 family – ciliogenesis/axon outgrowth and activity-dependent maturation.  

In summary, peak-cluster 2_14 delineates a late, enteric-neuron enhancer programme that switches on at ~24 hpf, is highly restricted to the ENS lineage, and is driven by PHOX2/HOX–PBX–MEIS, SOX10/FOX, and TLX/LHX/GATA factors orchestrating migration, positional identity and terminal neuronal differentiation in the developing zebrafish gut.

## Cluster 2_15

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 2_15 in a nutshell  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is fairly flat during early somite stages (0–20 somites, 10–20 hpf) but explodes at the late 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf).  
  – PSM_30 som ≈ 29-fold above baseline.  
  – Enteric-neurons_30 som ≈ 19-fold above baseline.  
  – Other lineages show only a 1.5- to 2-fold rise.  
→ The module is therefore a “late-activated” programme switched on close to the onset of organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is seen in:  
• Presomitic / newly-formed somite mesoderm (PSM_30).  
• Neural-crest-derived enteric neurons (Enteric-neurons_30).  
Secondary but significant signal is present in differentiating spinal cord / generic neurons, endoderm and fast muscle, but not in tail-bud or early mesoderm.  
→ The cluster marks two converging contexts: (i) the final maturation of paraxial mesodermal derivatives and (ii) neurogenic programmes in late neural-crest neurons.

3. Underlying regulatory/biological programme  
Associated genes are highly enriched for:  
• Neuronal specification and synaptogenesis – nrxn1/2/3, nlgn1, ncam1/2, robo1/2, ntrk1, epha4b, grid2, grik3/4, grm1/7, slc12a5, slc24a4, ddc, syt7, syngap1, shank3, unc5a/b.  
• Axon guidance / neurite outgrowth – sema4g, sema6b, ephb3a, unc5 family, lingo2, crumb homologs.  
• ECM / adhesion remodelers needed for tissue morphogenesis – col12a1a, col4a6, crispld2, galnt18, sorcs2, lpl, adamts17.  

Taken together, the peak set looks like an enhancer battery that coordinates late neuronal differentiation (especially enteric ENS formation) while simultaneously integrating paraxial-mesoderm segmentation and extracellular-matrix organisation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment row 15)  
Strongly enriched motifs belong to bHLH and clock/segmentation factors:  
• Proneural/neurogenic bHLH: NeuroD1/2/4/6, Atoh1a/1b, Atoh7, Olig2, Neurog3 – drive terminal neuronal differentiation and neurotransmitter gene expression.  
• Circadian/segmentation bHLH: Clocka/Clockb, BHLHE22/23 – consistent with the segmentation clock signal in late PSM.  
• Mesenchymal/crest bHLH: Tcf21, Twist1/2/3, Msc – expressed in neural-crest-derived mesenchyme and somitic sclerotome.  
• TFAP4 provides Myc-like E-box binding, helping to amplify NeuroD/Atoh output.  

Summary  
Peak-cluster 2_15 represents a late-somite enhancer module that turns on at ~24 hpf, with maximal activity in presomitic mesoderm and emerging enteric neurons. The motif landscape points to a bHLH-dominated network (NeuroD/Atoh/Olig/Clock/Tcf21/Twist) that orchestrates final neuronal maturation and segmentation-linked mesoderm patterning, together with ECM remodelling required for these morphogenetic events.

## Cluster 2_16

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 2_16 marks a neuronal gene-regulatory program that is first “primed’’ in posterior body-axis progenitors and later redeployed in peripheral neurons.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Earliest strong accessibility at the 5-somite stage (≈12 hpf), where it spikes in the tail-bud compartment (tail_bud_5 somites ≈ 29).  
   • Accessibility then persists at an intermediate level in many neuro-ectodermal samples and reaches a second maximum by 30 somites (≈24 hpf) in enteric neurons (enteric_neurons_30 somites ≈ 19).  
   → Biphasic profile: early activation in neuromesodermal/tail-bud cells followed by late activation during neuronal maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest signals are seen in:  
   • Tail-bud / neuromesodermal progenitors (5-som stage)  
   • Posterior neural tube & spinal cord derivatives (moderate)  
   • Neural-crest–derived enteric neurons (30-som stage peak)  
   Moderate accessibility is also present in generic differentiating-neuron pseudobulks and hindbrain/spinal-cord clusters, but is low in mesodermal, endodermal and muscle lineages.

3. Underlying regulatory program  
   Associated gene list is enriched for:  
   – Axon path-finding / synapse assembly molecules (NRXN2, GRIN2, GRID1, UNC13B, SYT1, SV2C, CLSTN2, TENM1/2, CADM1/2/4, SNAP91, SHANK1/2, RIMS3)  
   – Voltage-gated channel subunits (CACNA1C/G, SCN1LA, KCNB2, KCNC1, KCNQ4)  
   – Adhesion/ECM genes used by migrating neural-crest cells (COL4A3, COL15A1B, ADAMTS14)  
   Taken together the peaks correspond to enhancers driving late neuronal differentiation, synaptic specification and posterior (caudal) axial identity.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & factor mapping)  
   • Posterior HOX class TFs (HOXC9-13, HOXB7-10, HOXD9-12): set caudal neuronal identity.  
   • SOX10 / SOX9 / SOX11: neural-crest specification and neuronal differentiation.  
   • PAX3/7 and FOXD3/FOXF2: maintain tail-bud progenitors and vagal neural-crest competence.  
   • E-box/NEUROD/ATOH & MEF2 family motifs: terminal neuronal maturation and synaptic gene activation.  
   • Moderate E2F/FOXM1 signal reflects early proliferative state of NMPs before differentiation.

Summary  
Cluster 2_16 comprises regulatory elements that open early in tail-bud neuromesodermal progenitors, remain accessible through posterior neural tube development, and are finally maximally used in differentiating enteric (and other posterior) neurons to activate axon-guidance, synaptic and channel genes under the combined control of HOX, SOX, PAX/FOX neural-crest factors and neuronal bHLH/MEF2 effectors.

## Cluster 2_17

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 2_17 marks the chromatin program that switches on as neural progenitors leave the cell-cycle and differentiate—most striking in the enteric nervous system but shared with many maturing CNS neurons.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at gastrulation/early somitogenesis (0 – 5 somites) and rises steeply after 10 somites.  
   • It reaches its maximum between 20 – 30 somites (≈22-24 hpf), consistent with the onset of terminal neuronal maturation and circuit assembly.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Enteric neurons ≫ differentiating neurons of spinal cord / hind- & mid-brain.  
   • Only basal signal in non-neural lineages (muscle, mesoderm, endoderm, epidermis etc.).

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Genes in the cluster encode:  
   • Synaptic adhesion/organisation (NRXN1/2, CADM3/4, CNTN4, NXPH1, NLGN2, SRCIN1).  
   • Neuro-transmission components (GRIK2/3; CACNA2D1/2; KCND2/KCNG4; SLC18A2; SYT10).  
   • Axon guidance & neurite outgrowth (UNC5D, ROBO3, PLXNA1, BRSK2, MTSS1, MAP6).  
   • Neuronal cytoskeleton and polarity (ANK3, MAP1B, DIAPH3).  
   Altogether these point to late differentiation, axon extension and synapse formation of primarily glutamatergic / cholinergic neurons, including the vagal-derived enteric lineage.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster (motif enrichment & mapping)  
   • bHLH neurogenic factors: NEUROD1/4/6, ATOH1/7, OLIG2 – initiate neuronal differentiation.  
   • SOX family (SOX11, SOX4, SOX5, SOX21) – neurite growth & survival.  
   • Homeobox/PAX/LHX/DLX (PAX6, DLX2/5, LHX2/9, BARHL) – regional neuronal identity.  
   • MEF2 & CLOCK/BHLHE family – activity-dependent and circadian transcription in maturing neurons.  
   • E2F/FOXO motifs appear but likely reflect residual cell-cycle/ survival control.

Summary  
Peak cluster 2_17 represents the late-neuronal-maturation chromatin program that becomes highly accessible from ~18 hpf onward, is strongest in enteric and other differentiating neurons, and is orchestrated by SOX/bHLH neurogenic factors together with region-specific homeobox TFs to drive axonogenesis and synapse assembly.
]

## Cluster 2_18

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 2_18 captures a wave of chromatin opening that coincides with the onset of overt organogenesis and neuro-sensory differentiation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest from 0–10 somites (~10–16 hpf) and then rises steeply.  
   • Two clear maxima are seen:  
     – 15-somite stage (~18–19 hpf) – very large signal in the optic cup (46× basal).  
     – 30-somite stage (~24 hpf) – strong signal in presomitic/somite mesoderm and enteric-neuron clusters (≈19× basal).  
   Thus the cluster is most active during late segmentation through early organogenesis (18–24 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Optic cup / prospective retina  
   • Presomitic mesoderm / forming somites  
   • Enteric and other differentiating neuronal populations (spinal cord, hindbrain)  
   • Signal is low in endodermal, cardiac, epidermal and early axial progenitor (NMP) fractions.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Associated genes are rich in neuronal/axonal functions – ionotropic glutamate receptors (GRIK2/3/4, GRIA4), synaptic scaffolds (SYNGAP1b, TANC1b, SNAP91), guidance/adhesion molecules (CTNNA2, CADM2, PCDHs, COL4/5, NID2) and neuro-transmitter pathways (GABBR2, DRD2, NTRK1).  
   • Concomitant presence of HOX, DLX, MSX, LHX and MEF2 target motifs plus segmentation-related genes suggests coupling of anterior–posterior patterning/ somitogenesis with neural circuit assembly.  
   • Taken together, the peak set most likely regulates:  
     – Retinal neuro-genesis (ganglion-cell and early interneuron specification)  
     – Neuronal outgrowth and synaptogenesis in emerging CNS/PNS lineages  
     – Late segmentation–stage maturation of presomitic mesoderm into differentiated somite tissues.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs enriched and/or genes expressed)  
   Retina / sensory neuro-genesis: Pax6, Rx3/Rx1, Crx, Vsx1/2, Otx1/2, Six3/6, Atoh7, NeuroD1/4/6  
   General neuro-genesis & axon growth: Sox2/3/11, Foxg1, Lhx2/9, Dlx2/5, Msx1/3, Tcf/Lef, TFAP2 family  
   Segmental patterning & mesoderm: HoxA/B/C family, Mef2d/aa, Tbx1/15/18/20  
   Modulators: RA/RXR/RAR nuclear receptors, COUP-TF (Nr2f), E2F/FOX cell-cycle factors (reflecting proliferative retinal neuro-epithelium)

In summary, peak-cluster 2_18 marks enhancers that turn on during mid-somite stages and drive transcriptional programmes for retinal and broader neuronal differentiation while synchronising with late mesodermal segmentation processes.
]

## Cluster 2_19

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 2_19 marks a set of regulatory elements that switch on during neurogenesis and become maximally open in two neuron-derived tissues: the early optic cup (future retina) and late enteric nervous system (ENS).

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest (log₂ ≈ 2.5-3) at gastrula/early-segmentation stages but rises sharply between 10- and 30-somites.  
   • First peak: optic-cup cells at 10-somites (~14 hpf) – 36.9-fold above baseline.  
   • Second peak: enteric neurons at 30-somites (~24 hpf) – 19.4-fold above baseline.  
   Interpretation – the cluster is activated during retinal neurogenesis, then reused during terminal differentiation of ENS neurons.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility in:  
   • Optic-cup/retinal neuro-epithelium (10 s)  
   • Enteric neural-crest–derived neurons (20-30 s, maximal at 30 s)  
   Moderate signal in other differentiating neuronal populations (hindbrain, spinal cord, generic “neurons” samples) but not in mesoderm, endoderm or epidermis.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
   Associated gene set is highly enriched for:  
   • Neuronal excitability & synaptic function – ion channels (CACNA1B, KCNC2, SCN5L), neurotransmitter receptors (GRIK2, GRIA1/3, GRID1, GRM1/8), vesicle release (RIMS2/3, SYNGAP1, SHANK1), calcium handling (RYR2), adhesion/axon-guidance (SLIT3, NCAM1, CNTN3/4, UNC5A).  
   • Transcriptional/epigenetic regulators typical of neuronal lineages (NPAS3, TCF25, TRAPPC9, KDM4B, MLL family).  
   GO/pathway bias: neuronal differentiation, axonogenesis, synaptogenesis, glutamatergic signalling.  
   Together these features fit maturation of sensory/visceral neurons – especially retinal ganglion/amacrine cells and ENS neurons.

4. Likely driving transcription factors (motif enrichment + cell context)  
   Retina module (10 s optic-cup)  
   • Eye-field & retinal TFs: Rx3/Rx1, Pax6, Otx2, Crx, Vsx1/2, Six3/6, Onecut1/2/3, Zic1-3.  
   • General neurogenic bHLH factors: Neurod1/4/6, Atoh7, Ascl1.  
   ENS module (20-30 s enteric neurons)  
   • Neural-crest/ENS TFs: Sox10, Phox2b/a, Foxd3, Gata2/3, Hand2, Tfap2, Hox/Pbx/Meis combinatorial codes.  
   Shared pan-neuronal regulators: Lhx (Lhx2/4/9), Dlx, Uncx, Runx1/3, Nuclear receptors (Nr2f1/2, Rorb), CREB/ATF family and chromatin readers (Cxxc/Kdm2).  

   The motif landscape therefore supports a two-phase, tissue-specific neuronal programme: early eye-field factors prime the cluster in retinal progenitors, while neural-crest/Phox2/Sox10 factors later drive ENS-specific activity.

Summary – Peak cluster 2_19 represents a neuronal maturation enhancer module that is transiently hyper-accessible in retinal progenitors at 10 somites and, after redeployment, in differentiating enteric neurons by 30 somites. It likely coordinates expression of synaptic/ion-channel genes under control of Pax-Rx-Otx/Six factors in the retina and Sox10-Phox2-Fox/Gata/Hox factors in the ENS.

## Cluster 3_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 3_0 marks a broad, very active regulatory program that comes on during early segmentation stages and reaches maximum activity while embryos are forming and patterning the neural tube, notochord and somites.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already appreciable at ∼0–5-somite (~10–11 hpf) but rises steadily, peaking at 20- to 30-somite stages (∼22–24 hpf).  
   • Example values (0 → 30 somites):  
     – Midbrain–hindbrain boundary: 21 → 37  
     – Floor plate: 15 → 24  
     – Notochord: 23 → 17 (high early, then declines slightly)  
     – Somites: 24 → 17  

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Midbrain-hindbrain boundary neuroepithelium  
   • Ventral neural-tube midline (floor plate)  
   • Axial mesoderm (notochord) and early paraxial mesoderm / nascent somites  
   • Differentiating neurons in these regions  
   (PSM, tail-bud and optic cup show moderate enrichment; endoderm, epidermis and blood are low.)

3. Biological programme inferred  
   • Anterior-posterior and dorsoventral patterning of the neural tube and adjacent mesoderm.  
   • Coordination of segmentation (somitogenesis) with neural-tube regional identity.  
   • Genes in the cluster encode patterning TFs (otx2a, pax6a, vax1, pax7a/b, barhl, hox family), midline determinants (foxa2, lhx1/5), adhesion / guidance molecules (ctnna2, nrxn1b/3a, tenm2/4, adgrl3), and notochord / floor-plate morphogens (bmp7b, stra6).  
   • Overall, the peaks likely represent enhancers and promoters that set rostro-caudal identity, ventral midline fate and early neuronal connectivity while somites form.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
   • Hox class TFs – strong enrichment for multiple HoxA/B/C/D motifs, matching high hox gene accessibility; provide A-P positional codes.  
   • Fox family – foxa1/2, foxd1/3/5, foxg1, foxi/c/f motifs; crucial for floor-plate, notochord and fore-/mid-brain patterning.  
   • Pax3/6/7 and Irx/Pou/Lhx/Barhl groups – specify neural-tube domains and MHB.  
   • Nkx2.1/2.2/2.4, Lmx1, Otx2 – ventral midline and MHB determinants.  
   • Dlx/Barx/Msx/Tlx – neural-crest & dorsal interneuron enhancers (reflecting neighbouring domains).  
   • E2F/MEF2 motifs appear but are lower and probably reflect proliferative mesoderm and early myogenic input rather than the core programme.

Taken together, peak-cluster 3_0 represents a shared chromatin programme used by axial mesoderm, the midbrain–hindbrain organiser and ventral neural-tube midline to coordinate segmentation with early neural patterning and axon-guidance gene expression during 10–24 hpf zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 3_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 3_1 contains a set of regulatory elements that open very early in segmentation and stay accessible through early organogenesis, but they are used in a highly selective set of tissues – essentially the “eye field / optic cup” lineage with limited use in a few other patterned neuro-mesodermal domains.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Already accessible at the 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf).  
• Accessibility rises sharply by 5–15 somites (≈12–18 hpf), the window in which the optic vesicle evaginates, folds into the optic cup and retinal progenitors rapidly expand.  
• The signal stays high, but plateaus, through 20–30 somites (18–24 hpf).  

2. Cell-type specificity (highest pseudobulk accessibility)  
• neural_optic (> 9–13 log-counts) – eye-field / retinal progenitors.  
• optic_cup (≈7–11) – epithelium of the maturing cup.  
• midbrain-hindbrain-boundary (≈7–10) – another anterior neuroepithelial territory that shares the same homeodomain program.  
• somites show a moderate signal (≈7–8) but are secondary; most other cell types remain at background (≤ 4).  

3. Regulatory program inferred  
The gene set and motifs converge on the canonical “eye-field / early-retina” network:  
• eye-field specification (rx1/2, pax6a/b, vsx2, six3/6, otx2).  
• proliferation of retinal progenitors and early neurogenesis (vsx2/Chx10, sox2/3, atoh7/neurod, thrb).  
• optic-cup morphogenesis and dorsoventral patterning (tbx5a, lmx1, lef1, foxg1).  
• many Hox/Pbx/Meis loci are present – explaining the weaker signal in somites and MHB, and indicating these peaks belong to a broad homeodomain enhancer set used for anteroposterior patterning but maximally deployed in the optic neuroepithelium.  

Thus cluster 3_1 represents a retina-centric homeodomain enhancer module that drives eye-field establishment and early retinal differentiation while also contributing to other patterned neuro-mesodermal regions.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (supported by motif enrichment & gene presence)  
• Pax6 (master eye-field TF)  
• Rx1 / Rx2 (retinal homeobox)  
• Vsx2/Chx10 (retinal progenitor proliferation)  
• Six3 / Six6 and Otx2 (optic-cup specification)  
• Lhx2 and Meis/Pbx co-factors  
• Sox2/3 family (neuro-epithelial competence)  
• bHLH proneural factors Atoh7, NeuroD, Neurogenins (for neuronal commitment)  
• Nuclear receptors RAR / RXR and Thrb (retinoic-acid & thyroid-hormone inputs that tune retinal gene expression)  

Together these factors form the core transcriptional circuitry that the peaks of cluster 3_1 integrate and implement during zebrafish eye formation.
]

## Cluster 3_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 3_2 marks an extensive neural-tube regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is detectable at the 0-somite stage (10 hpf) but climbs sharply during early‐to-mid segmentation, peaking around 10–15 somites (≈14–18 hpf).  
   • After 20 somites accessibility begins to fall and is clearly reduced by 30 somites (24 hpf).  
   → This timing coincides with neural-tube patterning and the burst of neurogenesis that follows initial neurulation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest ATAC signal)  
   • Hindbrain (all rhombomeres) – strongest values (32–36).  
   • Spinal cord & posterior neural tube (25–28).  
   • Midbrain–hindbrain boundary, generic “neural”, neural floor plate, differentiating neurons (20–24).  
   • Very low in mesoderm, endoderm and non-neural ectoderm.  
   → Cluster 3_2 is therefore selectively open in the developing dorsal/central neural tube from mid-brain through spinal cord.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Associated genes and motifs are enriched for:  
   • Antero-posterior identity: densely populated Hox, Pbx, Meis, Uncx, Lbx, Gbx, Bsx genes.  
   • Dorsal neural-tube / roof-plate signals: wnt1, wnt4, wnt7ba, lmx1a/b, msx1/2/3, irx family, rfx4.  
   • Neurogenesis & axon guidance: atoh1a, neurod/olig genes, robo1/2, slit3, cntn2, nrxn1/3, gria4, grin2d.  
   • Cell-cycle drivers (E2F set) – consistent with the proliferative ventricular zone.  

   Together these point to a programme that (i) regionalises the hindbrain/spinal cord along the A–P axis via the HOX code, and (ii) specifies dorsal progenitors/early interneurons while they proliferate and initiate neuronal differentiation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Highest motif-z scores and gene co-occurrence highlight:  
   • HOX–PBX/MEIS cluster (Hoxb1/3/4/5, Hoxc/d paralogues, Pbx1/3/4, Meis1/2/3) – segmental identity.  
   • Pax6 / Pax3 / Pax7 – neural progenitor patterning.  
   • Irx1/3/5/7, Msx1/2/3, Lmx1a/b – dorsal spinal & roof-plate programme.  
   • SoxB group (Sox2/3/11/14/19) – neural stem-cell state.  
   • Fox family (Foxd3/d5, Foxg1, Foxk) – neural progenitor maintenance.  
   • Rfx4 – ventricular-zone ciliary gene network.  
   • Tcf/Lef & β-catenin targets – consistent with the Wnt ligands present.  

In summary, peak-cluster 3_2 defines chromatin regions that become transiently accessible in the hindbrain and spinal cord during mid-segmentation, underpinning HOX- and Wnt-driven patterning of dorsal neural-tube progenitors and their early neuronal derivatives.
]

## Cluster 3_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 3_3 is an “axial-mesoderm / early-somite” module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already very high at the 0-somite stage (10 hpf) and remains elevated through the 20-somite stage (≈19 hpf), with a modest decline by 30 somites (24 hpf).  
   • This profile matches the window in which the tail-bud, notochord and newly forming somites are specified and begin to differentiate.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Paraxial mesoderm / forming somites – all somite pseudobulks (≈35-43 units).  
   • Axial midline – notochord lineage (≈26-36 units) and tail-bud progenitors (≈22-23 units).  
   • Moderate signal in neural floor-plate and slow/fast muscle derivatives once they appear; low background in endoderm or neural crest.  

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Somitogenesis and segmentation (Mesp/Notch clock, paraxial mesoderm patterning).  
   • Initiation of trunk myogenesis (sarcomeric genes actn2b, ttn, sgcb, tpm-rich loci).  
   • Notochord maturation and midline signalling (foxa2/noto targets).  
   • Early anterior–posterior axial patterning (many Hox, Lhx, Meis genes appear in the correlated-gene list).  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (top motif enrichment & gene context)  
   • T-box / Brachyury family (ta/tb, tbx6, tbx16/18/24) – segmentation and tail-bud identity.  
   • Forkhead factors (FoxA/FoxF/FoxD/FoxC) – notochord & paraxial mesoderm enhancers.  
   • Hox / Meis / Pbx cofactors – regional axial identity of the emerging somites.  
   • Mesp-/Ripply-type bHLH and the somitic clock pair Tcf/Lef (Wnt) – segmentation circuitry.  
   • Mef2 / MyoD cluster – onset of muscle-structural gene activation within older somites.  
   • E2F/Kdm2 & Klf motifs are also enriched, consistent with rapid proliferation in tail-bud progenitors but likely secondary.

Together these observations indicate that peak-cluster 3_3 marks enhancers and gene bodies that coordinate segmentation, axial patterning and the first wave of trunk muscle and notochord differentiation between gastrulation and early organogenesis.

## Cluster 3_4

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 3_4 marks a coherent “early-neuronal patterning” program that turns on once the neural tube has formed and remains active through early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest at 0 som (10 hpf) but rises steeply by 10 som (14 hpf) and peaks between 15-20 som (17-20 hpf).  
• High signal is maintained, though slightly tapering, at 30 som (24 hpf).  
➔ The cluster therefore corresponds to the window when neural progenitors leave proliferation and begin regional specification and neurite outgrowth.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Optic cup / retinal progenitors – maximal signal (opt-cup 20 som ≈ 24 RPKM).  
• Midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) cells – very high (10–30 som ≥ 12 RPKM).  
• Neural floor plate & notochord – strong ventral-midline signal (8–11 RPKM).  
• Differentiating neurons throughout the CNS show clear but lower enrichment.  
➔ The pattern pinpoints organizers and pioneer neuroepithelia that instruct axial patterning (floor plate/notochord) and regional organizers (MHB, eye field).

3. Regulatory/biological program inferred  
Gene set is enriched for:  
• Cell-adhesion / axon-guidance molecules (TENM2/3, CDH18, NCAM2, CHL1, CTNNA2, SORCS3, PLXNs, OLFM2).  
• Synaptic and neurotransmission components (GRID2, GRM6/8, CADPS1/2, GUCY1A2, ADARB2).  
• Signalling modulators important for patterning (SFRP5 – Wnt, ESR1/NR2E1 – nuclear receptors).  
These point to establishment of neuronal polarity, long-range wiring and organizer-dependent positional identity rather than generic neurogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs & gene list)  
Highly enriched motifs and expressed TFs that fit the spatial pattern include:  
• Eye-field / retina: Rx1/2/3, Otx1/2, Pax6, Vsx1, Crx, Barhl1, Six3/6.  
• MHB & mid-hindbrain: Pax2/5/8, Engrailed (En1/2), Gbx2, Lmx1a/b.  
• Ventral midline: Foxa2, Lhx2/5, Shh-responsive homeobox (Nkx2.2/2.4).  
• Pan-neural stem factors: SoxB (Sox2/3/19), SoxC (Sox4/11), FoxG1.  
• Axon-growth/neuronal maturation: MEF2 family, NeuroD / Atoh / Olig bHLHs.  
Together these TFs wire the regulatory logic for optic-cup specification, MHB organiser activity, floor-plate/notochord signalling and early neurite outgrowth.

In summary, peak cluster 3_4 represents chromatin regions that open during 14–24 hpf in organiser-like neural territories (optic cup, MHB, floor plate, notochord) to control regional patterning and the first wave of axon-guidance/neuronal wiring genes, driven by a cadre of homeobox (Rx/Otx/Pax/En/Gbx), Sox and Fox TFs aided by MEF2 and bHLH neuronal activators.

## Cluster 3_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 3_5 represents the cis-regulatory program that builds the early eye/optic cup and its rapidly-dividing neural-retinal progenitors.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0-somite (10 hpf) but rises steeply through 5–10 somites and reaches a maximum at 15–20 somites (≈17–22 hpf), coinciding with optic-vesicle evagination and optic-cup morphogenesis.  
   • A slight decline is seen by 30 somites (24 hpf), matching the transition of progenitors to neurogenic retina.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility values)  
   • Optic-cup epithelium / retinal progenitors (values 49-71; >2-fold higher than any other lineage).  
   • Secondary, weaker signal in notochord and floor-plate, reflecting shared RA and Hedgehog inputs but at ~½–⅓ the optic level.  
   • Most other neural or mesodermal cell types show only basal accessibility.

3. Regulatory program inferred from linked genes  
   Eye-field specification and optic-cup proliferation  
   • Eye-field TFs and patterning genes: rx1/2, vsx2 (chx10), pax6a/b, otx1, vax1/2, six3/6, lhx2, tbx2/3/5, foxg1, meis, eya2.  
   • Retinoic-acid synthesis & response: aldh1a2, aldh1a3, rarga/b, rxr, nr2f (Coup-TF) family.  
   • Wnt/Hh modulators: axin2, sfrp1a, gli2/3, ptch1 (hedgehog target genes).  
   • Cell-cycle/proliferation machinery typical of retinal progenitors: e2f factors, mki67, foxm1, mcm genes.  
   • Neural/retinal differentiation onset markers appear only sparsely (e.g. neurod, atoh1c), consistent with a progenitor-biased state.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene set)  
   • Canonical eye-field / retinal TFs – PAX6, RAX (Rx1/2 motifs), VSX2/VSX1, SIX3/6, LHX2, OTX, TBX2/3/5.  
   • SoxB1 family (Sox2/3/19) motifs – maintain neural competence.  
   • RA-receptors (RAR/RXR) & COUP-TFs – integrate retinoic-acid signalling that patterns the optic primordium.  
   • E2F/FOXM1 cluster – drive the high mitotic activity of retinal progenitors.  
   • MEIS/PBX & Onecut factors – support anterior neural plate/retinal identity.  
   • Moderate enrichment for GLI (Hedgehog) and NR2F/COUP-TF motifs, consistent with Shh and RA inputs from midline/notochord.

Taken together, cluster 3_5 marks enhancers that switch on at gastrulation, peak during optic-cup formation, and are almost exclusive to the retinal progenitor lineage, integrating Sox/Pax/Rx/Six eye-field factors with RA, Wnt-Hh modulators and cell-cycle TFs to drive early retina specification and expansion.
]

## Cluster 3_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 3_6 tracks a classic “hindbrain-segmentation / early-neurogenesis” enhancer program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at 0–5 somites, climbs sharply, and peaks at 10–15 somites (~14–17 hpf).  
   • Signal falls thereafter (20 som ≈ 19 hpf) and is markedly lower by 30 somites (~24 hpf).  
   → The window coincides with rhombomere patterning and the onset of cranial-neuron differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Hindbrain pseudobulks dominate: 46.5 (0 som) → 62.8 (10–15 som) – >10-fold higher than most other tissues.  
   • Secondary but much weaker signal in differentiating neurons, spinal cord and neural crest; negligible in mesoderm/endoderm.  
   → Cluster 3_6 is essentially a hindbrain-restricted chromatin program.

3. Likely biological processes regulated  
   • Anterior-posterior (rhombomere) identity: extensive Hox PG1-5 genes (hoxb1, hoxa2, hoxb3/b4/b5, etc.), Krox20/egr2a-b and mafba signatures that mark r3–r6.  
   • Cranial motor-neuron and interneuron specification: phox2a/2b, isl1/2, lmx1, lhx2/4/9, dbx1, nkx6.1/6.2, pax2/3/6/7.  
   • Early neuronal maturation / axon guidance: robo/slit, grid/gria, ntrk3, sema3, plxna1, etc., present in the gene list.  
   • Cell-cycle exit of neural progenitors (co-enrichment of E2F motifs but falling accessibility after 15 som).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (supported by motif and gene co-expression)  
   • Segmental selectors: Hox PG1-5 plus their Pbx/Meis/Prep cofactors (strong Hox-, Pbx-, Meis-motif z-scores).  
   • Rhombomere-specific regulators: Egr2/Krox20 (r3/r5) and Mafba (r5/r6).  
   • Neural differentiation factors: Phox2 (visceral motor), Lhx/Lbx, Isl, Irx, Pax6/7, Nkx6.1.  
   • Sox family motifs are present but lower; they likely mark generic neuroectodermal competence rather than drive specificity.

In summary, peak-cluster 3_6 represents a transient, hindbrain-specific enhancer set that is maximally open during mid-somitogenesis, orchestrated by Hox-Pbx/Meis together with Krox20, Mafba and other rhombomere/neural TFs to establish hindbrain segment identity and to launch cranial-neuron differentiation.

## Cluster 3_7

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 3_7 – concise biological interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is moderate at 0-5 somites, rises sharply by 10 somites and reaches its maximum at 15-30 somites (≈ 18-24 hpf).  
• Pattern = “late-somitogenesis / early-organogenesis” module that turns on as progenitors commit and begin terminal differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signal)  
• Paraxial mesoderm / skeletal-muscle lineage  
  – somites (0 → 30 som): 17 → 27 (highest values in the matrix)  
  – fast-muscle pseudobulks  
• Differentiating & mature neurons  
  – differentiating-neurons, spinal cord, hindbrain, optic-cup, neural/neurons pseudobulks  
• Cardiac and other mesodermal derivatives – heart myocardium, lateral-plate/fast muscle.  
• Secondary but notable: endocrine pancreas, hatching-gland, optic tissues.  

3. Implied regulatory programme / biology  
Gene set points to coordinated maturation of neuromuscular tissues:  
• Myogenesis & sarcomere assembly – Myo1b, Mybpc2a, Ryr2b, Mef2-targets, Fn1a, TnC.  
• Neurogenesis / axon guidance & synaptogenesis – Unc13b, Syt1a, Adarb2, Dlg2, Eph/Ephrin (epha3/4/7, ephb2/3/6), Semaphorins (sema3/5/6), Cadm/Protocadherins.  
• Patterning / positional identity – dense Hox, Pax, Tbx, Runx, Fox and Wnt‐response (Axin2, Ctnna2, Tcf7l2).  
Overall, cluster 3_7 marks distal regulatory elements that switch on when paraxial mesoderm becomes contractile muscle fibres and when neuro-ectodermal derivatives elaborate long-range axons and synapses.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
• Muscle module – MyoD/Myf5, MEF2 family, SRF/TEAD (contractile-gene enhancers).  
• Neuronal differentiation – SoxC group (Sox11/4/12), NeuroD/Neurog, Atoh1/7, bHLH (Olig2, Tal1/2).  
• Axial & tissue patterning – Pax3/7, Hox (multiple paralog groups), Tbx4/5/20, Runx1/3.  
• Forkhead & SoxF (FoxC/D/F, FoxO; Sox17/18) bridging mesoderm & endoderm inputs.  
• Wnt/β-catenin effectors – Tcf7/7l1/7l2, Lef1.  
These TFs collectively explain the late, lineage-restricted surge of accessibility seen in muscles and neurons during 15-30-somite stages.
]

## Cluster 3_8

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 3_8 captures the regulatory landscape of the embryonic midline (notochord + floor plate) during neural-tube patterning.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at 0–5-somite stages (≈10–12 hpf) but rises steeply thereafter, peaking from 10 to 30 somites (≈14–24 hpf).  
   • The monotonic increase (e.g. neural floor plate: 37 → 60 arbitrary units from 0 → 30 somites) indicates continued activation through early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest signals are confined to axial midline derivatives:  
   • Neural floor plate (by far the strongest in every time-point)  
   • Floor plate (non-neuronal annotation)  
   • Notochord and tail-bud axial mesoderm (moderate–high)  
   Other tissues (somites, spinal cord, endocrine pancreas, epidermis, etc.) show only basal levels, confirming midline specificity.

3. Regulatory programme / biological processes  
   Gene set and motif content point to a Shh-driven ventralisation module:  
   • Midline/ventral neural-tube genes shha, shhb, gli2b, gli3, nkx2.2a, nkx2.4b, nkx2.1, foxa2, lhx2/5, arx, ptch2  
   • Notochord markers noto, foxa3, tbx2/16, meox1  
   • Axon-guidance & neuronal differentiation robo1, slit3, sema3/5/6, tenm2/3, npas3, fezf2  
   • Hedgehog, FoxA/FoxO and E2F pathway components suggest coupling of patterning with proliferation.  
   Together, the cluster likely regulates (i) establishment and maintenance of the notochord/floor-plate signalling centre, (ii) ventral patterning of the neural tube, and (iii) subsequent differentiation of floor-plate and adjacent ventral interneurons.

4. Key transcription factors (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
   • FOXA/Foxa2 – pioneer factor for floor-plate enhancers, high motif z-scores, gene present.  
   • GLI1/2/3 – Hedgehog effectors; motifs enriched, genes present.  
   • NKX2 family (nkx2.2a, nkx2.4b, nkx2.1) – ventral neural-tube selectors.  
   • LHX2/5 & ARX – floor-plate/ventral neuronal specification.  
   • HOX (antero-posterior refinement) – broad HOX motif enrichment.  
   • E2F/FOXM1 cluster – proliferation of midline progenitors.  
   These factors collectively drive and maintain the midline Shh signalling centre and its downstream ventral neural identities.

In summary, peak cluster 3_8 marks enhancers that switch on during somitogenesis in notochord and floor-plate cells, integrating FOXA/GLI/NKX-driven Hedgehog signalling to pattern the ventral neural tube and sustain midline identity through early organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 3_9

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 3_9 – concise biological interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises steadily from the 0-somite (~10 hpf) stage and peaks at 20–30 somites (~22–24 hpf).  
• Somite‐matched pseudobulks show ~2–4-fold increases, indicating that these regions become active during the major wave of neurogenesis that accompanies early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Differentiating neurons (all regional subclasses)  
• CNS territories – hindbrain, midbrain–hindbrain boundary (MHB), telencephalon, optic cup, floor-plate / spinal cord  
• Neural-crest derivatives (enteric neurons, pharyngeal arches)  
• Moderate but clearly lower signal in mesodermal lineages (fast muscle, PSM/somites) and endoderm-derived pancreas.  
Thus the cluster is chiefly a neuro-ectoderm/ neural-crest enhancer set with minor spread to adjacent mesoderm.

3. Likely regulatory programme / biological processes  
Gene set and motif content point to:  
• Neural plate patterning along the antero-posterior axis (HOX-, PBX-, LHX- and PAX-controlled regional identity).  
• Onset of neuronal differentiation – proneural TFs (ascl1b, olig2), cell-cycle exit (E2F motifs down, MEF2 up).  
• Axon guidance / synaptogenesis – robo1/2/3, sema3f/5b, teneurins (tenm1/2/4), cadherins/neurexins, ion-channel subunits (cacng2a, kcnq5b, ryr2).  
• Neural-crest migration / peripheral neuron specification (foxd3, sox10, zeb2b, adamtsl genes).  
Overall, cluster 3_9 marks enhancers that drive late-gastrula to early-organogenesis neural identity, maturation and wiring.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (enriched motifs + matching expressed genes)  
• SOX family (Sox2/3/10/11/21) – maintains neural/crest competence and early differentiation.  
• HOX–PBX/MEIS code – confers segmental hindbrain & spinal identity.  
• PAX factors (Pax6, Pax3/7) – dorsal neural tube & eye/forebrain programmes.  
• FOX factors (FoxG1, FoxD3, FoxL1/FoxP) – forebrain development, neural-crest fate.  
• LHX / LMX / TLX / Lbx & other LIM-homeodomain proteins – neuronal subtype specification.  
• MEF2 & NPAS/NeuroD bHLH factors – maturation, activity-dependent genes.  
• Nuclear receptors (ROR, RXR/RA receptors) – retinoid signalling that coordinates HOX activation.  

In summary, peak cluster 3_9 corresponds to a pan-neuronal enhancer set that switches on from mid-somite stages, is most accessible in differentiating central and peripheral neurons, and is governed by a composite SOX-HOX/PBX-PAX-FOX regulatory network orchestrating neuronal patterning, differentiation and early circuit assembly in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 3_10

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 3_10 captures a large set of regulatory elements that switch on during the main wave of neurogenesis and axon‐path-finding in zebrafish embryos.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises continuously through somitogenesis, is already noticeable at 5–10 somites (≈13–15 hpf) and reaches a clear maximum at 20–30 somites (≈19–24 hpf).  
   • The late-somite peak coincides with the onset of neuronal differentiation, floor-plate maturation and long-axon outgrowth.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest‐scoring pseudobulks)  
   • Neural floor plate (>10 a.u. all time-points; strongest signal)  
   • Spinal cord / differentiating neurons (progressively up to ≈13 a.u.)  
   • Midbrain–hindbrain boundary & hindbrain neuroepithelium  
   • Somites / presomitic mesoderm (moderate; reflects shared Hox programme)  
   • Early optic cup (transient spike at 5 somites)

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Genes linked to the peaks (NPAS3, PAX6a, CUX2b, CTNNA2, DSCAML1, SLIT3, SEMA5B/6D, FZD3b, GFRA1a, STMN4, SCN12aa, RBFOX3b, etc.) encode:  
   • Neuronal fate determinants and transcriptional regulators  
   • Cell-adhesion / guidance molecules (cadherins, semaphorins, slits, ephrin/Frizzled) essential for axon path-finding and neural circuit assembly  
   • Cytoskeleton/vesicle components needed for neurite extension and synaptogenesis  
   • A subset of Hox-controlled patterning genes, coupling rostro-caudal identity to neuronal maturation  

   ⇒ Cluster 3_10 therefore marks a “neuronal differentiation / axon guidance” enhancer set that operates from the floor plate and spinal cord outward as the embryo enters early organogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene presence)  
   • SOX family – Sox2/3 (progenitor maintenance) and Sox4/11/21/19 (neuronal commitment)  
   • Homeobox patterning factors – Pax6, Irx1/3/5/7, numerous HoxB/C/D genes; integrate AP and DV positional cues  
   • FOX factors – Foxa2/Foxd3/Foxp1-4/Foxk; crucial for floor-plate identity and neural crest contributions  
   • MEF2 & NeuroD / bHLH (activity-dependent neuronal maturation)  
   • Nuclear-receptor retinoid modules – RAR/RXR/COUP-TF (Retinoic-acid signalling that times neurogenesis)  
   • E2F/TFDP – transient cell-cycle component as progenitors exit proliferation  

Together, these TFs form a hierarchical programme: positional (Hox/Irx/Pax-Foxa2), fate-commitment (SOX/NeuroD/MEF2), and maturation/signalling (nuclear receptors), driving the high accessibility we observe in neural floor-plate and spinal-cord lineages at late somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 4_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 4_0 represents a short-lived but very broad chromatin-opening event that sweeps through the embryo at the mid-somite stage.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low at 0–10-somites, explodes at 15-somites (~16–17 hpf), and collapses again by 20-somites.  
   • Example (15-somites / 0-somites fold-change): Tail-bud 45×, NMP 9×, PSM 8×, Endoderm 8×, Endocrine-pancreas 9×, Floor-plate 8×.  
   • Virtually all cell types show the spike, indicating a global developmental transition rather than lineage-restricted maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity (peak amplitude at 15-somites)  
   1. Tail-bud / posterior axial progenitors (highest signal)  
   2. Neuromesodermal progenitors & presomitic mesoderm  
   3. Early endoderm derivatives (primitive gut, endocrine pancreas)  
   4. Floor-plate / neural tube midline and differentiating neurons  
   5. Emerging muscle and heart mesoderm  
   Thus the module is strongest in posterior growth zone and in trunk organs initiating differentiation.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Posterior axis extension and segmentation: strong enrichment of posterior HOX motifs, T-box (T/Bra, Tbx1/5/16), and Wnt/FGF-responsive FOX/SOX factors, typical for tail-bud and somite maturation.  
   • Concomitant activation of retinoic-acid / nuclear-receptor motifs (RARα/β, RXR, COUP-TF/NR2F2) and SFRP1-linked Wnt attenuation suggests the RA–Wnt antagonism that triggers the trunk-to-tail transition.  
   • Cell-cycle/E2F and MEF2 motifs indicate coupling of this axial patterning pulse to proliferative exit and early myogenesis.  
   • Associated genes (raraa, nr2f2, sfrp1a, vegfd, cacna2d3, grid2, grm7) fit posterior patterning, RA signalling and onset of neuro-mesodermal and vascular differentiation.

4. Likely driver transcription factors  
   • Posterior HOX paralogues: Hoxb5/6/7/8/9, Hoxc8/9/10/11/13, Hoxd9/10/11/12/13  
   • FOX family: Foxa1/2/3, Foxd1/3/5, Foxf2a/b, Foxg1, Foxi1/2/3, Foxp1/2/4  
   • SOX family: Sox2/3/5/9/10/11/14/19  
   • T-box proteins: Ta, Tbx16, Tbx1/5/18/20  
   • Nkx and Pax posterior-neural factors: Nkx1-2, Nkx2-2/4/5/7; Pax3/7, Pax6/8  
   • Nuclear receptors mediating RA & steroid cues: RARα/β/γ, RXRα/β, NR2F2 (COUP-TFII), NR4A family  
   • Cell-cycle regulators: E2F1-4/7/8  
   • MEF2 (mef2ca/cb/aa/ab) linking to nascent myogenesis.

Together, peak-cluster 4_0 marks the genome-wide regulatory pulse that accompanies the 15-somite “body-plan hand-off”: posterior growth zone activity, segmentation, initiation of trunk organ programs and synchronised exit from proliferative NMP states, orchestrated by HOX-FOX-SOX-Tbx networks under RA/Wnt/FGF control.
]

## Cluster 4_1

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 4_1 – concise biological interpretation

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already elevated at the onset of somitogenesis (0-5 somites, ≈10–12 hpf).  
   • It reaches a sharp maximum between 10–15 somites (≈14–17 hpf).  
   • Accessibility collapses by 20–30 somites (≈18–24 hpf), indicating an early-phase, transient program.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest relative signal)  
   • Hatching-gland cells: 4.8–6.3-fold above baseline at 0–15 somites – the dominant contributor.  
   • Second-tier enrichment: endocrine pancreas, midbrain/hindbrain boundary, early hemangioblasts / vasculature, and nascent enteric / spinal neurons.  
   • Most other lineages hover around baseline (~1.4), underscoring the strong bias toward the secretory ectodermal/endodermal derivatives listed above.

3. Likely regulatory programme / biology  
   Associated genes and GO terms point to a “calcium-dependent secretory–exocytosis” module:  
   • Vesicle priming & fusion – UNC13B, CADPS2, CPNE7, DNM1A, EXOC3L2/4, RAB-related COPA.  
   • Ca2+ handling – CACNA2D1, ITPR3, STIM1B, ATP2A3.  
   • Membrane transporters – ABCC9, ABCA3B, SLCO2B1, SLC22A7B.3.  
   • ECM/remodelling & adhesion – ADAMTSL3, COL28A2, PDGFRB, TGFBR3, CD44A.  
   These features match the biology of hatching-gland pro-secretory cells that synthesize and exocytose chorion-digesting proteases, and are re-used in other early secretory lineages (endocrine pancreas, nascent neurons).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (top motif families enriched in this cluster)  
   • Forkhead (FOX) – Foxa1/3, Foxf2, Foxd3/d5: pioneer factors for secretory/endodermal enhancers.  
   • SOX-B/E family – Sox19b/Sox2/Sox3: maintain open chromatin in early ectoderm-derived secretory cells.  
   • GATA factors – Gata5/6 (endoderm & secretory fate).  
   • Pax2/5/8 & Pax7 – regulators of anterior ectodermal specialisations including hatching gland.  
   • Hox/Pbx/Meis module – positional information for anterior ventral ectoderm where the gland forms.  
   • AP-1 / ATF-CREB and NFAT motifs – consistent with Ca2+/MAPK-coupled secretory activation.

Summary  
Cluster 4_1 demarcates an early, transient enhancer set that is maximally active in hatching-gland cells (10–15 somites) and, to a lesser extent, in other newly emerging secretory lineages.  It encodes a calcium-regulated exocytosis/ECM programme driven by pioneer Forkhead and SOX factors together with GATA, Pax, Hox–Pbx and AP-1/NFAT transcriptional inputs.
]

## Cluster 4_2

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 4_2 captures the chromatin program that turns on during somitic muscle maturation—especially formation of fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibres.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises modestly at gastrulation/early somitogenesis (0–5 somites), increases at mid-somite stages (10–15 somites) and reaches a sharp peak at 20–30 somites (≈19–24 hpf).  
   • This timing matches the switch from myogenic progenitors to terminally-differentiated myofibres.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest signal is confined to the muscle lineage:  
   • Fast-muscle pseudobulks (log accessibility ≈ 5–7.5) > generic “muscle”, mature “somites” and late presomitic mesoderm.  
   • All other tissues remain at basal background (~1–2).  
   → Cluster 4_2 marks cis-regulatory elements active in fast-muscle fibres and, to a lesser extent, their immediate predecessors in the PSM.

3. Regulated biological processes / pathways  
   Gene set is enriched for:  
   • Contractile apparatus & sarcomere organisation: ttn, actn3b, myl4, tln1, vcla, xirp2b, cers5.  
   • Myofibre structural/ECM remodelling: adamts2, spon1b, plxna2, thsd7bb.  
   • Muscle-specific signalling & metabolism: mef2aa, vgll2a, abcc9 (KATP), trpm4b, cftr, wnk1b.  
   • Together these point to late myogenesis, fibre-type specification and functional maturation of contractile fast muscle.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif and gene enrichment highlight classical skeletal-muscle regulators:  
   • MEF2 family (mef2aa/b/ca/cb, SRF partners) – high z-scores, present in gene list.  
   • Myogenic bHLH cascade – myod1, myf5, myf6, myog motifs appear in TCF groups (41/42).  
   • TEAD1/3 (TEAD–VGLL2 co-activator pathway important for fibre growth; vgll2a gene enriched).  
   • SRF (MADS box) and associated CArG‐box motifs (M00045/M00056 series).  
   • FoxO / Klf / E2F motifs are present but likely reflect generic growth & metabolic control.

Together, these data indicate that peak cluster 4_2 represents muscle-specific enhancers/promoters that become maximally accessible as fast-twitch myofibres differentiate and assemble their contractile machinery during late somitogenesis.

## Cluster 4_3

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 4_3 – concise biological interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Chromatin is broadly open in most tissues (baseline ~2 au), but a sharp spike (≈ 43 au) is seen only at the 15-somite stage (≈ 18 hpf).  
• Accessibility is modest at 5- and 20-somites and almost absent at 0-, 10- and 30-somites.  
⇒ The cluster marks a short-lived regulatory burst centred on the 15-somite stage.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• The extreme peak is restricted to the pharyngeal_arches pseudobulk (15-somites).  
• Secondary enrichment (2–3 au) is present in neural-crest cells, cranial/lateral-plate mesoderm and early neurons, but almost absent in early fast-muscle and notochord.  
⇒ The cluster is most specific for the cranial-neural-crest–derived pharyngeal-arch mesenchyme at the onset of arch morphogenesis.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Associated genes and GO enrichment (ECM, cartilage/bone matrix, morphogen signalling) point to:  
• Craniofacial skeleton primordia – cartilage & early osteogenic matrix (col10a1a, col12a1b, runx2b, fgf7, wnt5b, gdf5, loxl4, itga8).  
• Patterning of arch segments – DLX/MSX/HOX regional codes, Barx1-dependent jaw specification, Tbx1-mediated endoderm/mesoderm signalling.  
• Cell-matrix remodelling and neural-crest epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition genes (sema6d, angpt1, ADAMTS, cadherins).  
⇒ Cluster 4_3 comprises enhancers/promoters that drive the transient gene programme building the pharyngeal arches and laying down the future craniofacial cartilage/bone.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
Pharyngeal-arch / cranial-crest code:  
• DLX family (Dlx2/3/5/6) – distal arch patterning, cartilage condensations.  
• MSX1/2 – neural-crest EMT and chondrogenic competence.  
• BARX1/BARX2 – jaw/skull mesenchyme identity.  
• HOX (A2, B3, C8, C10/11/13) & MEIS/PBX cofactors – anteroposterior arch regionalisation.  
• FOX (Foxc1/2, Foxd3, Foxl1) & SOX (Sox9/10) – crest maintenance and chondro-osteogenic differentiation.  
Supporting factors: PAX3/7, TBX1, RUNX2, MEF2, ETS (Etv, Fli1) and AP-1 (Jun/Fos) motifs, fitting known regulators of craniofacial skeletogenesis.

Summary  
Peak cluster 4_3 represents a pharyngeal-arch–specific enhancer set that becomes maximally accessible only at ~15 somites, orchestrated by DLX/MSX/BARX-HOX/MEIS-FOX/SOX transcription factors to activate extracellular-matrix, signalling and patterning genes required for early craniofacial cartilage and bone formation.

## Cluster 4_4

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 4_4 corresponds to a short-lived burst of chromatin accessibility that marks the onset of optic-cup / early-retina differentiation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • First detectable at the 5-somite stage (~11 hpf) in optic tissue,  
   • Explodes at the 15-somite stage (~16 hpf) – accessibility in Optic-cup cells rises >30-fold compared with all other samples (42.9 vs ~1),  
   • Rapidly falls by the 20-somite stage and returns to baseline by 30 somites.  
   → The cluster therefore marks the morphogenetic window when the optic vesicle folds into the bilayered optic cup.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest in “optic_cup” pseudobulks (particularly 15-somites),  
   • Modest accessibility in “neural_optic” and forebrain–eye field progenitors,  
   • Virtually absent in non-ocular lineages.  
   → The peaks are optic-cup enhancers active in retinal progenitor/early neuro-epithelial cells.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   Gene set and motif composition point to classic eye-field / retinal‐progenitor functions:  
   • Patterning and morphogenesis of the optic cup (rx3/rax, otx1/2, six3/6, lhx2, pax6/2, vsx1),  
   • Activation of early photoreceptor/retinoblast differentiation modules (crx, nr2e3, rorb, nrl/maf),  
   • Suppression of alternative neuronal fates (eya/barhl, dlx, irx).  
   Biological processes: eye-field specification, epithelial bending and invagination, initiation of retinogenesis, and cell-cycle exit of retinal progenitors.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (enriched motifs & gene co-expression)  
   • Eye-field TFs: Rx3/Rax, Pax6a/b, Otx2/1, Six3/6, Lhx2 – set up retinal identity.  
   • Forkhead/Sox pioneer factors: Foxg1/foxd1/foxe3 and Sox2/3/19 open optic enhancers.  
   • Meis/Pbx & Hox co-factors – anterior neuroectoderm patterning of the eye.  
   • Vsx1, Crx, Nr2e3, Nrl/Maf – turn on early photoreceptor and bipolar programmes as accessibility declines.  
   Together these factors explain the sharp, optic-cup-restricted accessibility profile of cluster 4_4.

In summary, peak cluster 4_4 captures enhancers that transiently open during optic-cup formation, driven by eye-field/homeobox TFs, and orchestrate the transition from generic anterior neural epithelium to committed retinal progenitors.

## Cluster 5_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 5_0 marks a classical “epithelial/secretory module” that turns on mid-somitogenesis and is shared by surface ectoderm–derived epithelia and endodermal secretory tissues.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at 0–5-somites, but rises sharply between 10- and 15-somites (≈14–18 hpf), then gradually decreases by 30-somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • The peak therefore coincides with early organogenesis, when epithelia polarise and the first endocrine pancreatic cells mature.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest pseudobulk values)  
   • Hatching-gland/​periderm (56–89 a.u.; strongest signal).  
   • Endocrine-pancreas (38–57 a.u.).  
   • Surface epidermis (34–46 a.u.).  
   • Maturing endoderm and gut epithelium also show moderate accessibility, whereas mesodermal or neural lineages are low.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
   The gene set is enriched for:
   • Epithelial junction / polarity components – epcam, cldn7b/​cldnb, ocln/​oclnb, pard3ba, rab25, alcama, cx28.8.  
   • Cytoskeleton & adhesion – flnb, enah, shroom3, flrt2, itpr1/2, capn family.  
   • Secretory and metabolic factors – abca3b, atp8b1, fabp2, ugt8, ppargc1a, gfpt2.  
   • Pancreatic/​gut epithelial regulators – pdx1-targets (abca3, rab25), fox/​gata genes, esrp1/2 (epithelial splicing).  
   Collectively these loci control epithelial maturation, apico-basal polarity and the onset of specialised secretory activity (mucus in hatching-gland cells, peptide hormone secretion in endocrine pancreas).

4. Likely key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and TF-mapping point to six TF groups that match the biology above:  
   • FOX family (Foxi3a/b, Foxa1/3, Foxd1/3, Foxl1, FOXK2) – pioneers of epithelial and endodermal enhancers.  
   • GATA factors (Gata4/5/6, Gata3) – drive endoderm- and ectoderm-derived epithelial genes.  
   • GRHL/TFCP2 & KLF family (Grhl2b, Tfcp2, Klf4/5/17) – establish tight-junction gene expression.  
   • PDX1 / Onecut / HNF (Pdx1, Onecut1/2/3, Hnf4a/g) – endocrine-pancreas differentiation.  
   • SOX & Ovol/​Otx auxiliary motifs – maintain epithelial identity.  
   • NR5A/PPAR/Retinoid-receptor motifs – link to lipid-handling and secretory maturation.

In summary, cluster 5_0 comprises enhancers that switch on during mid-somitogenesis in hatching-gland, epidermal and endocrine-pancreatic epithelia, orchestrated principally by FOX and GATA factors together with epithelial-maintenance TFs (GRHL/KLF/TFCP2) and pancreas-specific drivers (PDX1-Onecut-HNF).
]

## Cluster 5_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 5_1 captures a short-lived, “early‐segmentation” chromatin programme that is shared by several nascent trunk lineages.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is maximal at the 0–5-somite stages (≈10–13 hpf) and falls steeply thereafter (10 som ≈14 hpf; almost baseline by 25–30 som).  
   • The decline is monotonic across all represented cell types, indicating that the elements are used transiently during initial lineage specification rather than during later differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest pseudobulk values)  
   • Enteric-neuron progenitors (43→10)  
   • Surface ectoderm / epidermis (39→11)  
   • Early paraxial-mesoderm derivatives – “muscle” cluster (37→9) and fast-muscle precursors  
   • Notochord (33→17) and floor-plate cells  
   • Moderate signals in NMP/PSM, endoderm, hatching-gland, etc.  
   → 5_1 therefore marks chromatin that is opened simultaneously in multiple axial/trunk progenitors as they leave the tail-bud and begin lineage-restricted programmes.

3. Likely biological functions  
   Integrated gene list points to genes needed for:  
   • Antero-posterior patterning & segmentation – dense coverage of Hox (b1-d13), Pbx/Meis cofactors, uncx, tbx, Cdx, Ripply, etc.  
   • Early neuro-mesodermal and neural-crest specification – sox10, phox2a/b, lmx1, gata2/3, runx1/3, dllx/irx/gbx families, slit/robo guidance cues.  
   • Myogenic initiation – myf5/6, myod1, mef2 family, actin-myosin genes (myh10, tnnt2a).  
   • Epithelial/epidermal maturation – grhl1/2, klf, tfap2, keratin-related cadm/claudin genes.  
   • Broad cytoskeletal and ECM remodelling (col11a1a, col14a1a, agrn, adamts, acaca) needed for collective cell movements during convergent extension.  
   Together, these features define an early trunk-patterning / epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition module that primes multiple tissues for subsequent organogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment (highest z-scores) and TF-name overlap highlight:  
   • Hox–Pbx/Meis axis (motifs M00111-114) – master regulators of axial identity.  
   • Sox family (sox5/9/10/19, sox2/3) – neural-crest & neuro-ectoderm competence.  
   • Fox factors (foxa/foxd/foxf) – mesendoderm and epithelial remodelling.  
   • Pax3/7, Pax6 – epidermal/neural crest & early neurogenesis.  
   • Nkx & Tbx (nkx2.x, tbx20/5) – mesoderm and cardiac/somite polarity.  
   • Mef2 / MyoD – initiating skeletal-muscle gene expression.  
   • Runx, Gata, Irx/Lhx/Barhl families – lineage-specific controllers for enteric neurons and cranial structures.  
   • E2F/FOX M1 – brief proliferation burst accompanying early fate decisions.

In summary, peak-cluster 5_1 represents a set of cis-regulatory elements that open transiently at the onset of segmentation, are shared by multiple emerging trunk lineages (epidermis, muscle/somite, notochord, and enteric-neuron precursors) and are driven by a classic cocktail of early patterning TFs (Hox/Pbx/Meis, Sox, Fox, Pax, Nkx/Tbx). It encodes the genomic framework that coordinates axial patterning, early neuro-mesodermal divergence and the first wave of tissue-specific differentiation in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 5_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 5_2 captures an “early surface-ectoderm / periderm” programme that switches on as soon as the embryo starts making somites and is largely shut down by the end of the first day.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at 0-somite stage (10 hpf), climbs to a maximum at 10--15 somites (~15-19 hpf; epidermis 46-47 a.u.), and falls sharply by 30 somites (~24 hpf).  
→ The peaks therefore mark a transient window spanning gastrulation to mid-segmentation when the periderm and nascent epidermis are being specified and spread.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• Highest signals: epidermis / surface ectoderm (top values 41-47).  
• Secondary but distinctly lower signal: paraxial mesoderm derivatives (somites, fast-muscle, PSM, NMPs) – these tissues lie immediately beneath the periderm and share some epithelial programmes.  
• Very low in neuro‐ectoderm, endoderm, blood/vasculature or internal organs.  
→ Cluster 5_2 is strongly biased to the outer epithelial sheet.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Associated genes are enriched for:  
• Epithelial barrier & cytoskeleton: keratin regulators (tp63), junction/adhesion components (adamts2/10, col1/2/7/18, lama1, itga3, itgb6, tns1).  
• Extracellular-matrix remodelling and basement-membrane deposition (mmp9, hmcn1, fbn2b, postnb, vcana).  
• BMP / TGFβ / Wnt cues that specify non-neural ectoderm (bmp2b/3/4, bmpr1ab/2b, wnt10a, tgfb1a, tgfbr3).  
• Grainyhead and p63 targets (grhl1, tp63, claudin-like genes) that drive periderm maturation.  
Functional theme: assembly and expansion of the embryonic periderm / epidermis and its underlying basal lamina during body elongation.

4. Likely driver transcription factors  
Motif enrichment together with expressed TFs points to:  
• TP63 – master regulator of stratified epithelia; its gene and binding motif are present.  
• GRHL family (Grhl1) – essential for periderm sealing.  
• GATA3 – promotes ectodermal and epidermal gene sets.  
• TEAD / Hippo (Tead3b) – cooperates with p63 in epithelial growth.  
• AP-1 (Fos/Jun, Batf) and KLF factors (Klf17/9/4) – generic epithelial and wound-response enhancers.  
• IRF6/ARNT‐family motifs – known periderm regulators (cleft-lip/-palate genes).  
• FOX factors (Foxp1/4, Foxl1) – often cooperate with p63/Grhl in barrier formation.

Together, these data place peak-cluster 5_2 at the core of the transient transcriptional and chromatin programme that builds the zebrafish periderm / early epidermis during somite stages.
]

## Cluster 5_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 5_3 corresponds to the early epidermal/periderm gene-regulatory program that establishes the first epithelial barrier of the embryo.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises immediately after gastrulation and peaks from 0-10 somites (~10–15 hpf).  
   • It remains high through 20 somites (~19 hpf) and then drops sharply by 30 somites (24 hpf), indicating that the programme is switched on during early segmentation and is largely completed before early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility values)  
   • Epidermis / periderm (> 27–31 CPM units at 0–15 somites; largest signal in the atlas)  
   • Non-neural ectoderm derivatives with an epithelial identity: hatching-gland, endocrine pancreas primordium, endoderm and tail‐bud ectoderm show moderate signal, consistent with shared use of epithelial barrier genes.  
   • Mesodermal and neural populations display only baseline accessibility.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Genes under the peaks are heavily enriched for:  
     – Epidermal differentiation & barrier formation (tp63, irf6, grhl1/2b, klf4, grhl1, abca12, abca1b, acaca, fasn, slc and abca lipid-transporters, multiple keratin/cadherin/claudin genes).  
     – Epithelial adhesion and ECM remodelling (cdh1, cdh22, col4a6, itga6b, lama5).  
     – Lipid metabolism required for waterproofing the embryonic skin (fasn, acaca, acadvl, abca/abcb family).  
     – Early ectoderm specification factors (tfap2a/c, dlx, foxi3, gata3/6).  
   • GO/KEGG terms (not shown but typical for this gene set): “epidermis development”, “cell-cell adhesion”, “lipid homeostasis”.

   Together these features indicate that peak-cluster 5_3 marks enhancers that drive specification of surface ectoderm and maturation of the zebrafish periderm/basal epidermis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (supported by motif enrichment + gene presence)  
   • AP-2 family (tfap2a / tfap2c) – highest motif z-score (M00111/112/113) and essential for non-neural ectoderm.  
   • p63 (tp63) – master regulator of epidermal fate; motif present (TP53-family M00452/53) and gene highly expressed.  
   • GRHL factors (grhl1, grhl2b) – motifs enriched (M04859 etc.); govern epithelial barrier genes.  
   • IRF6 – motif and gene present; required for periderm differentiation.  
   • KLF family (klf4/6/17, sp-/klf motifs M086–M088 series) – promote stratification and barrier lipid genes.  
   • GATA3/6 – moderate motif enrichment; cooperate in surface ectoderm/endoderm epithelium.  
   • TEAD1/3 (Hippo effector; motif M082) – active in maturing epithelia.

   These factors collectively activate the lipid-metabolic, adhesion and structural gene set that builds the functional embryonic skin.

In summary, cluster 5_3 captures an early, epidermis-specific enhancer set that is maximally active during 0-20-somite stages in surface ectoderm/periderm cells, controlled by AP-2, p63, GRHL, IRF6 and KLF TFs to orchestrate epithelial differentiation and barrier formation.
]

## Cluster 5_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 5_4 represents an early “surface-ectoderm / epidermis” enhancer program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0-somites (~10 hpf; 19.6 log‐units), maximises at 10–15 somites (14–17 hpf; 22.8 – 22.0) and falls sharply by 30 somites (~24 hpf; 1.8).  
   • Thus the cluster is most active during gastrulation-to-mid-somitogenesis, coinciding with initial epidermal specification and periderm maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Epidermis pseudobulks dominate (top six values across all time-points).  
   • Sub-threshold, but appreciable, accessibility occurs in other surface-ectoderm-derived or epithelial lineages (enteric neurons, endocrine pancreas, endoderm), consistent with shared epithelial enhancers.  
   • Mesodermal and neural progenitors show only baseline signal.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
   • Structural epidermal / periderm genes: krt1-19d, lama3/5, lamb2l, col7a1, fras1/frem1/2, st14, spint1b, mmp28.  
   • Adhesion & polarity: cdh13/22/24, cldn1, itga2/3/8, itgb1, pard3/6.  
   • Signalling components typical of skin development: wnt10a, wnt3a, wnt9a/b, bmp7a, smad3, rarga/b, rxr genes.  
   • Transcription regulators found in the gene list (tp63, tfap2a/c, grhl2/3, klf5/9/17, gata3/6, dlx3b/4a) are canonical drivers of periderm and basal-keratinocyte fate.  
   Together these annotations point to control of epithelial barrier formation, basement-membrane assembly and early stratification of the larval skin.

4. Key transcription factors (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
   • TP63 / TP73 – hallmark basal-epidermal enhancers.  
   • TFAP2 family (tfap2a, tfap2c, tfap2d) – activate epidermal and periderm genes.  
   • GRHL1/2/3 – grainyhead factors essential for periderm sealing.  
   • KLF5 / KLF17 and GATA3/6 – promote epithelial differentiation and tight-junction formation.  
   • DLX3B/4A and IRX factors – cranial placode & superficial ectoderm network.  
   • RARG / RXR and TEAD1/3 – integrate retinoic-acid and Hippo cues during skin maturation.  
   • Moderate enrichment for RUNX/E2F motifs fits the high proliferative state of early epidermis.

Summary – Peak-cluster 5_4 marks enhancers that turn on in the surface ectoderm at gastrulation, reach maximal activity during mid-somite stages, and drive the transcriptional programme that builds the zebrafish epidermis/periderm and its basement membrane.
]

## Cluster 5_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 5_5 corresponds to the “early surface–epithelium / periderm” programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises sharply at gastrulation and remains highest from 0- to 20-somite stages (≈10–22 hpf).  
   • The signal collapses by 30 somites (24 hpf), indicating the programme is switched off once the definitive epidermis and underlying organs start maturing.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest values)  
   • Epidermis / surface ectoderm – strongest signal (12-14 a.u. at 0–15 som.)  
   • Periderm-like derivatives: hatching-gland (4–8 a.u.)  
   • Epithelial endodermal derivatives that transiently use the same barrier toolkit – endocrine-pancreas and early endoderm (4–8 a.u.)  
   • All other lineages stay at background (~2–3 a.u.).

3. Biological processes represented  
   Gene catalogue is enriched for:  
   • Structural epidermal genes – keratins (krt17, krt99), tight-junction/claudin genes (cldn7a, cldn10a), desmosomal/ECM genes (fras1, frem2, lama5, hmcn1) and lipid-barrier transporters (abca12, abcb4, abca6).  
   • Barrier formation / mucosal defence – duox, cxcl14, il11b, claudins.  
   • Pan-epithelial polarity & vesicle trafficking genes (rabgef1l, snap25a, atp8b1).  
   • Early endocrine-pancreatic markers (pdxka, slc5a10) consistent with the transient accessibility in that tissue.  
   Together these point to programmes that establish apical–basal polarity, basement membrane and the first functional external barrier (periderm/early epidermis).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and TF–gene overlap highlight classical epidermal regulators:  
   • TFAP2 family (Tfap2a/c/d/e) – initiators of surface ectoderm fate.  
   • TP63 / TP73 – master regulators of epidermal stratification.  
   • GRHL1 / GRHL2 – reinforce epithelial junction and barrier genes.  
   • IRF6 & KLF family – periderm maturation and keratin cytoskeleton.  
   • FOXI3 / FOXL2 and SOX9/10 – ectodermal epithelium/pancreatic epithelium interface.  
   • TEAD/TEAD3 – Hippo–controlled epithelial growth.

Summary: Peak-cluster 5_5 is most accessible in the nascent surface epithelium between gastrulation and early organogenesis, drives genes required for building the first protective epithelial barrier, and is orchestrated by the TFAP2–TP63–GRHL–IRF6 core transcriptional module with support from FOX/KLF/TEAD factors.
]

## Cluster 5_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 5_6 represents a set of regulatory regions that open very early, are most accessible in superficial epithelial/endodermal lineages, and then gradually close as organ primordia mature.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility peaks between 0-10 somites (≈10-14 hpf) and is already declining by 20 somites and largely shut by 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • This “early-burst / taper-off” profile is typical of enhancers that prime lineage programs before overt differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest average log-accessibility)  
   • Surface ectoderm / epidermis (periderm): 42 → 31 → 12 across 0-20-30 somites – the strongest signal in the atlas.  
   • Early endoderm derivatives: endocrine-pancreas (>30 at 0-10 som) and general endoderm (~22).  
   • Additional moderate signal in lateral-plate mesoderm, hatching gland, midbrain-hindbrain boundary and early vasculature, consistent with tissues that begin as epithelial sheets.  

3. Inferred regulatory programme  
   • Genes in the cluster encode cell-junction components (OCLN, CLDNs), ECM/basement-membrane proteins (FN1a, LAMA5, COL18A1, VCAN), polarity/adhesion regulators (TP63, FAT4, MAGI2/3, PARD3, ADAMTS/L), and epithelial/endoderm TFs (GATA3, SOX18, PDX1, PRDM1a).  
   • Gene ontology therefore points to:  
     – Establishment of epithelial barrier and apical–basal polarity.  
     – Early epithelial remodelling that precedes budding of organs such as the pancreas and vasculature.  
     – Coordinated proliferation of these epithelia (E2F, FoxM1 motifs).  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (enriched motifs & associated genes)  
   • TP63 / TFCP2-family – master regulators of periderm/epidermis.  
   • GATA factors (Gata3/4/6) – epithelial and endoderm maturation; match to GATA motif enrichment.  
   • FOX family (FoxA1/3, FoxC, FoxI, FoxL, FoxP) – pioneer factors that open endodermal and epithelial chromatin; multiple FOX motifs highly enriched.  
   • SOX-F group (Sox18, Sox7/17/9) – vascular/epithelial specification.  
   • PDX1 & RFX6 motifs – signature regulators of early pancreatic endocrine fate.  
   • TEAD/TAZ and E-cadherin–associated factors (e.g. FAT4-Hippo axis) hinted by high M00111/114 motifs, linking sheet growth with Hippo signalling.  
   • E2F1/2/3/4 motifs – driving the burst of proliferation in the early epidermis and gut epithelium.

Together, cluster 5_6 marks “early epithelial priming enhancers” that are switched on shortly after gastrulation in surface ectoderm and nascent endoderm, preparing these tissues for later differentiation into epidermis/periderm, pancreatic islets and associated epithelial organs.
]

## Cluster 5_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 5_7 is an “epithelial / barrier-gene” module that turns on soon after gastrulation, is maximally accessible while the surface ectoderm is being laid down and later remains open in epithelial derivatives such as the endocrine pancreas.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises between the 5- and 15-somite stages (≈13–16 hpf).  
   • Epidermal nuclei peak at 10–15 somites (≈80 a.u.); accessibility then falls sharply by 30 somites (≈32 a.u.).  
   • In endocrine-pancreatic cells the signal keeps climbing (11 → 18 → 17 a.u.) and stays high at 30 somites, indicating reuse of the same regulatory set in later endodermal epithelium.

2. Cell-type specificity (top accessible pseudobulks)  
   1. Epidermis / periderm (all early time-points; far higher than any other lineage).  
   2. Endocrine pancreas epithelium (from 10 som onwards).  
   3. Moderate in hatching-gland, enteric neuron precursors and notochord, consistent with shared superficial-epithelium gene sets.

3. Biological programme encoded  
   Gene list is enriched for epithelial barrier, junction and basal-layer components:  
   – Tight-junction / polarity: cldn1, cldna, cldnb, cldni, oclna, lama5, lamb1a.  
   – Cytoskeleton/keratins: krt17, krt4, krt92/97, actn1.  
   – Cell-adhesion / ECM remodelers: cdh6, adam17b/28, mmp15/20/30, col1a2, col5a3a.  
   – Canonical epithelial TFs: tp63, gata3/4/6, grhl2b, tfap2c, klf4, irf6.  
   – Secretory epithelium / endocrine cues: wnt6b, wnt9a/9b/10a, lect2, ptges/ptgis.  
   Together these peaks mark regulatory regions that drive stratified-epidermis formation, epithelial barrier maturation and, later, endocrine-pancreatic epithelial differentiation.

4. Predicted key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment + expressed TFs point to:  
   • TP63 / p53-family – basal epidermal specification.  
   • TFAP2 (a/c) – surface ectoderm programme.  
   • GRHL (grainy-head) – epithelial tight-junction genes.  
   • GATA3/6 – epidermis and pancreatic endoderm.  
   • KLF4/6 – epithelial differentiation, barrier integrity.  
   • IRF6 & AP-1 (Fos/Jun) – periderm maturation and wound/barrier response.  
   • TEAD1/3 (Hippo pathway) – epithelial growth/sheet maintenance.  
   • SOX & FOX subgroup factors (Sox2/5/9; Foxi3/Foxl1) supply generic epithelial/ectoderm competence.  

In summary, peak-cluster 5_7 encodes a conserved epidermal/barrier transcriptional programme that is first deployed in the zebrafish periderm and is subsequently co-opted by other epithelial tissues such as the endocrine pancreas.

## Cluster 5_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 5_8 marks an “early-epithelial/periderm” regulatory program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0-somite (≈10 hpf), peaks through 5–15 somites (12-16 hpf) and then progressively declines (20–30 somites / 19-24 hpf).  
   • This profile fits the time-window in which the zebrafish periderm and other nascent simple epithelia are being laid down and start to mature.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • By far the strongest signal is in epidermis/periderm pseudobulks (≈ 85-90 units at 0–15 somites; 4-6-fold higher than most other lineages).  
   • Moderate accessibility is seen in other simple epithelia that bud from surface or endodermal sheets (endocrine-pancreas rudiment, optic cup, hatching-gland, early enteric epithelium).  
   • Mesodermal (somite, muscle) and neural plate domains show only basal levels.

3. Biological programme represented  
   Associated genes are enriched for:  
   • Cell-cell junction / barrier formation – cldn1, cldn7b, cldnb, cdh26, nectin1b.  
   • Basement-membrane & ECM assembly – lama5, lamc1, col4a5, fn1a, agrn, nid2a.  
   • Epithelial polarity & cytoskeleton – frmd6, frmd4ba, ripor1/2, ezrin/radixin family, keratin-associated factors.  
   • Signalling modules that pattern or stabilise epithelia – wnt3a/5b/9a, bmp2b/1a, fgfr1a/2, egfra, smad7.  
   • Classic periderm/skin TFs – grhl2b, irf6, klf17, sp6, spdef, gata3/6.  

   Together these point to enhancer sets that drive establishment and early maturation of the periderm / surface ectoderm and allied simple epithelia (tight-junction sealing, basement-membrane deposition, early morphogen-driven sheet movements).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
   • Grainyhead-like (GRHL2/3) – master activators of periderm genes.  
   • IRF6 – essential for periderm integrity; strongest IRF motif family enrichment.  
   • KLF family (KLF17/6/4/9) – promotes epithelial barrier genes.  
   • TFAP2 / SP6 / SP8 – AP-2 and Sp-family factors that cooperate with GRHL/IRF in epidermis.  
   • FOXI1/FOXI3 & FOXL1/FOXL2 – forkhead factors that open epithelium-specific chromatin.  
   • GATA3/6 – reinforce epithelial identity, especially in endoderm-derived simple epithelia.  
   • Supporting factors: JUN/FOS (AP-1), BATF, BACH1/2 and IRF family members reflecting stress-responsive and barrier-formation roles.

Summary: Cluster 5_8 comprises enhancers that switch on early, remain active through mid-somitogenesis and are most accessible in the superficial ectoderm/periderm, orchestrated by GRHL2-IRF6-KLF-FOXI/AP2 modules to drive epithelial barrier formation and morphogenesis.

## Cluster 5_9

[*assistant*:
Biological synopsis for peak cluster 5_9

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at the onset of somitogenesis (0–5-somite, ≈11-12 hpf), remains elevated through 10–20-somite stages (≈14–19 hpf) in superficial tissues, and shows a second spike at 30-somites/24 hpf – but this late spike is now centred in neuromesodermal-derived tissues (NMPs and mature somites).  
→ Two waves: early (surface ectoderm / epidermis) → late (trunk dermomyotome / NMP-derived paraxial mesoderm).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest average accessibility)  
Early wave (0–20 som):  
• Epidermis / surface ectoderm (>18–22 AU)  
• Periderm-like epithelium and differentiating neurons show moderate signal.  
Late wave (30 som):  
• NMPs (24.8 AU) and bulk somites (26.0 AU)  
• Moderate in PSM, spinal cord, tail-bud.

3. Regulatory programme suggested by associated genes  
Enriched genes point to an epithelial / dermomyotome module.  
• Barrier & adhesion: tp63, cdh1, cldn10a, cldne, krt4/97, abca12, clint1, cert1, plin1  
• Extracellular matrix & cell-migration: col12a1b, col16a1, tnc, adam17a, mmp30, rock2a/b, tln1, itpk1b  
• Patterning / signalling: wnt6b, wnt7bb, bmp3, acvrl1, slit2, kitb, klf2b, epas1a  
• Dermomyotome / trunk specification: prdm1b, satb1b, pbx4, tbx genes, several HOX clusters.  
Together these genes fit formation and later remodelling of the outer epithelial sheet and the emerging dermomyotome-like layer that envelops trunk somites.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif-enrichment + gene list)  
• p63 / p53-family (tp63 and TP53 motifs) – master regulator of epidermal/periderm enhancers.  
• Grainyhead-like factors (grhl1/2) – typical of surface ectoderm barrier programmes.  
• GRHL-co-operating FOX/ SOX classes (FOXI/FOXA/FOXF, SOX3/5/9/18) – support epithelial differentiation & plasticity.  
• KLF family (Klf2/3/5/9) – keratinocyte and vasculogenic ECM genes.  
• AP-1 (Jun/Fos/Batf) and TEAD/YAP (Tead1/3 motifs) – respond to mechanical tension and drive ECM/actin genes found here.  
• PBX/MEIS-HOX combinations – give the strong axial-pattern signature seen in late-somite NMP/somite peaks.

Conclusion  
Peak cluster 5_9 marks enhancers that first drive surface-ectoderm (epidermal/periderm) maturation and, later, are reused in the trunk dermomyotome and neuromesodermal lineage as somites mature. It is governed by an epithelial GRHL-p63-FOX/SOX regulatory cassette, modulated by KLF/AP-1/YAP in response to mechanical cues, and over-laid with axial HOX–PBX patterning inputs at late stages.

## Cluster 6_0

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 6_0 captures a late-differentiation “excitability” program that turns on strongly in the last (30-somite, 24 hpf) stage, primarily in trunk/fast muscle but also in the maturing optic cup and scattered post-mitotic neurons.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is fairly uniform (≈1.3–2.2 a.u.) from 0- to 20-somites, then spikes at 30-somites (44.3 a.u. in bulk-muscle; 35 a.u. in optic cup).  
   • This step-change indicates activation during the terminal maturation phase when contractile machinery and synapse components are installed.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Muscle lineage – bulk “muscle_30somites” and “fast-muscle_30somites”.  
   • Eye/retina – “optic_cup/neural_optic 10–15-somites”.  
   • Moderate signal in differentiating spinal/brain neurons; low in mesoderm/endoderm.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Enriched genes: structural/contractile (tnni2a, ttn, sgcd), Ca2+-handling (ryr1b/ryr2, cacna1d, itpr1b, camk2g), and neuromuscular/neuronal adhesion or synaptic genes (cntnap2a/b, nrxn2, gria4a, pcdh11, ppfia4).  
   • Together these point to assembly of the excitation–contraction / excitation–secretion apparatus:  
     – Sarcomere organisation and force generation in skeletal muscle.  
     – Voltage-gated Ca2+ influx and ryanodine/IP3 receptor–mediated release.  
     – Formation of neuromuscular and retinal synapses.  

4. Key transcription factors (motifs enriched)  
   • Myogenic bHLH: MyoD1, Myf5/6, Myogenin (Msc), Myf6 – initiate and maintain skeletal-muscle gene expression.  
   • MEF2 family & SRF – drive late sarcomeric and Ca2+-handling genes.  
   • NFAT family – Ca2+-responsive co-activators that cooperate with MEF2/SRF.  
   • Pax3/7 and Six1/4 – early muscle/optic-cup patterning inputs retained as motifs.  
   • Crx/Onecut/OTX and Pax6 – retina/optic-cup regulators explaining the optic-cup signal.  

In summary, peak cluster 6_0 marks a transcriptional module that “switches on” at the 30-somite stage to build the contractile and excitable infrastructure of skeletal muscle (with a parallel deployment in developing retinal neurons).

## Cluster 6_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 6_1 – concise biological interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Strongest burst at the earliest sampled stage (0-somite, 10 hpf) and another spike at the latest stage (30-somite, 24 hpf).  
   • Between these two peaks accessibility remains only “baseline” (≈2-fold) in most tissues.  
   → The elements are first deployed during very early heart formation and re-used during late somitogenesis / myotome maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility values)  
   • Heart myocardium 0-somites ≈ 44 (largest value in the matrix)  
   • Generic “muscle” population 30-somites ≈ 48  
   • Minor but above-baseline signal in fast-/slow-muscle, PSM and somites; negligible in endoderm, neural crest, epidermis, etc.  
   → Cluster 6_1 marks a mesodermal, striated-muscle lineage programme shared by cardiac precursors first and by differentiated trunk muscle later.

3. Underlying regulatory programme / biology  
   Enriched genes point to:  
   • Myofibril / sarcomere assembly – myog, tcap, vgll4a, lama1, loxl3b, hspg2, multiple collagens.  
   • Excitation–contraction & ion handling – cacng2a, cacng6b, kcnq5b, slc12a5a, slc24a2.  
   • ECM remodelling & morphogenesis – adam19b, adamts6/adamtsl3, runx2a, wnt9a.  
   • Early cardiac signalling – fgf11/13, gpc5a, gata-target ECM genes.  
   Together these point to a programme that builds contractile, extracellular-matrix-rich muscle tissue— first in the heart tube, then in somitic skeletal muscle.

4. Likely driving transcription factors  
   Motif and gene enrichment converge on classic striated-muscle regulators:  
   • Mef2 family (mef2aa/ab/b/c/d, SRF motifs): terminal differentiation and sarcomere gene activation.  
   • Myogenic bHLH’s (Myod1, Myf5, Myog) – commitment and fibre-type genes.  
   • Cardiac TF set active only at 0-somite heart: Nkx2-5/2-7, Gata4/5/6, Tbx5/20, Hand2.  
   • TEAD-co-factor VGLL4 and SRF co-factor MRTF (via actin dynamics motifs) – consistent with high ECM/actin expression.  
   • Proliferation/expansion phase factors (E2F1-5/7, FoxM1) present but with negative z-scores, fitting the transient early proliferation of cardiomyocytes before differentiation.  

Summary  
Peak-cluster 6_1 comprises regulatory elements that open first in nascent cardiomyocytes (10 hpf) and are later reused in differentiating trunk muscle (24 hpf).  The elements drive a contractile- and ECM-oriented gene set under the control of Mef2/Myod/Gata/Nkx/Tbx TFs, embodying a conserved striated-muscle differentiation programme shared by heart and skeletal muscle lineages.
]

## Cluster 6_2

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 6_2 marks the chromatin programme that drives the somitic-mesoderm → skeletal-muscle trajectory.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at 0 somite stage (10 hpf) in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) but rises steeply after somitogenesis begins.  
   • It increases through 5-, 10- and 15-somite stages and reaches its maximum between 20–30 somites (≈ 22–24 hpf), coinciding with overt myofibre differentiation.  
   • Late-stage values: Fast-muscle (20 s = 18.0; 30 s = 21.4) and total-muscle pseudobulk (20 s = 18.6; 30 s = 50.0) are >10-fold higher than most non-myogenic lineages.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Fast skeletal muscle > pan-muscle > somites/PSM > tail-bud mesoderm.  
   • Minor, much lower signal in cardiac myocardium; negligible in endoderm, neural or ectodermal derivatives.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Gene set is packed with sarcomere and muscle-cytoskeleton components (ttn.1/2, actc1, myhz1.3, pgm5, smyd1a/b, srfb, ablim2, strbp) and actin-dynamics genes (enah, diaph2, cyth2).  
   • Functional themes: myoblast fusion, myofibrillogenesis, actin-myosin contractility, metabolic specialisation of fast fibres.  
   • Early accessibility in PSM/NMP plus presence of patterning genes (e.g. tbx, kank1a) suggests involvement from specification through maturation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched & present in mapping table)  
   • Myogenic bHLH “MRFs”: Myod1, Myf5/6, Myog – dictate myoblast determination and differentiation.  
   • MEF2 family (mef2ca/cb/aa/ab/d) – essential co-activators of structural muscle genes.  
   • SRF (srfb) & TEAD1/3 – regulate actin-cytoskeleton and Hippo-dependent growth of fibres.  
   • TCF12/21 and E2F factors provide, respectively, bHLH partnering and cell-cycle exit control during myogenesis.  
   • Supporting patterning TFs: Tbx15/18, Pax3/7, Six1/4 in early somite stages.

Taken together, peak cluster 6_2 represents a muscle-lineage-restricted set of regulatory elements that switch on during somitogenesis and reach maximal activity as fast-twitched skeletal fibres terminally differentiate in the 20–30 somite embryo.
]

## Cluster 6_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 6 _3 captures a late-segmentation/early-organogenesis regulatory module that turns on as tissues leave proliferation and begin overt differentiation, with a bias toward neuro-ectodermal derivatives and a burst of activity in the hatching-gland/optic primordium.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises steadily through the somitic series and peaks at the 20–30-somite stages (≈ 22–24 hpf).  
     – Differentiating-neurons: 6.5 → 9.4 (0 → 30 somites)  
     – Floor-plate, spinal cord, optic-cup and muscle all show similar late up-swings.  
     – Massive jump in the hatching-gland at 30 somites (≈ 8-fold over earlier stages).  

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Neuroectoderm: differentiating neurons (brain & spinal cord), floor-plate, optic-cup/retina.  
   • Neuro-mesoderm interface: tail-bud/notochord, PSM (moderate but rising).  
   • Specialized ectodermal derivatives: hatching-gland.  
   • Late skeletal muscle (muscle_30 somites) shows a secondary, tissue-restricted spike.

3. Implied regulatory programme  
   Gene set is enriched for factors and effectors of:  
   • Neuronal differentiation & axon guidance – Lhx3, Zeb2b, Qki, Qkib, Grik3, Rapgef4, Ncam1, Epha3/Ephb6, Agrn, Ank2b.  
   • Synapse / neuro-muscular junction maturation – Adamts3, Trdn, Wnt4, Agrn.  
   • Cell-cycle withdrawal & chromatin remodelling – Kdm2, Dnmt1, Auts2a, Ankdr11, Phf21b.  
   • Extracellular-matrix/epithelial remodelling – Adamts3, Crim1, Fstl4.  
   Together these point to a programme that drives terminal differentiation of neurons (especially sensory/retinal and spinal cord types), formation of neuro-muscular contacts, and functional maturation of the hatching-gland epithelium.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment & TF-mapping highlight two converging modules:  
   • E2F/FOX cell-cycle node – strong enrichment for E2F1-8 and FoxM1 motifs suggests the cluster marks loci that open as progenitors exit cycle; residual E2F binding often ‘book-marks’ late-expressed neuronal genes.  
   • Pax/Sox developmental node – Pax6a/b motifs dominate (classic regulators of eye-field, forebrain and spinal cord neurogenesis), together with Sox2/11/4/10.  
   Additional, tissue-restricted inputs:  
   – MEF2 family (mef2ca/-cb/-d) in the muscle-biased peaks.  
   – RFX & NFAT for ciliogenesis/secretory functions in the hatching-gland.  
   Collectively, PAX6 + SOX factors establish neural identity, E2F/FOX govern proliferation-to-differentiation transition, and MEF2/RFX tune the programme in muscle and gland cells.

In summary, peak-cluster 6 _3 is a late-acting, neuro-ectoderm-centred regulatory hub that becomes most accessible around 20–30 somites, is most active in differentiating neurons, optic primordium, hatching-gland and maturing muscle, and is driven by a PAX6/SOX developmental axis layered on an E2F-FOX cell-cycle switch, with MEF2 and RFX providing tissue-specific modulation.
]

## Cluster 6_4

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 6_4 in a nutshell  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already moderate in most tissues at 10–20 somites but triples-to-quadriples at the 30-somite stage (≈ 24 hpf).  
• The largest jump is in muscle at 30 somites (fast-muscle_30 ≈ 44-fold over background). A short, earlier pulse is seen in optic-cup cells at 10 somites.  
⇒ The cluster marks the late‐maturation phase of the myotome / skeletal-muscle lineage.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Very broad baseline, but the highest signals are in  
• Fast / general skeletal muscle (fast-muscle, “muscle”, somites)  
• Myotome-related mesoderm (PSM, lateral-plate mesoderm)  
• A transient peak in optic-cup neuro-epithelium (retina precursors)  
Other lineages never rise above the ~3-unit baseline.

3. Regulatory programme represented  
Enriched genes point to terminal myofibre differentiation and function:  
• Sarcomere assembly & contractility smyhc2, myoz2b, fhod3a, tns1b, myom1b  
• Ca²⁺/electrical excitability cacna1bb, cacna2d2a, ryr2b, gria2b  
• Fatty-acid & mitochondrial metabolism cpt1aa, cpt1cb, acad11, ppargc1b  
• Extracellular matrix & costamere lamc2, lama3, col11/14/27, fn1a, itga9  
Together they define the switch from proliferative myoblasts to contractile, metabolically specialised myofibres.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
Motif enrichment and gene co-expression highlight a canonical late-myogenic module:  
• Myogenic bHLH factors MyoD1, Myf5/6, Myog (motifs: E-box / TCF21, TFAP4, bHLH)  
• MEF2 family Mef2aa/b/c, Srfa/b – required for sarcomere gene activation  
• SRF/TEAD–Yap axis supports cytoskeletal and costamere genes  
• FOXO3/FOXO4 & KLF family coordinate oxidative metabolism and fibre maturation  
• E2F/FOXM1 motifs appear, reflecting the residual cycling of earlier stages that is shut down by 30 somites.

Interpretation  
Cluster 6_4 harbours regulatory elements that turn on as zebrafish paraxial mesoderm exits proliferation and consolidates into fully functional skeletal muscle fibres. The same regulatory logic is briefly reused in the optic-cup epithelium, explaining its secondary spike at 10 somites.
]

## Cluster 6_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 6_5 corresponds to the “late myogenic / cardiogenic” regulatory programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest and nearly uniform (~5–6 units) from 0- to 20-somite stages, but jumps dramatically at the 30-somite (~24 hpf) stage.  
   • The largest increases are in muscle_30somites (≈ 46) and heart_myocardium_30somites (≈ 25), indicating maximal activity when skeletal muscle fibres and the beating heart are beginning functional maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility:  
   • Skeletal muscle lineages – fast-muscle, general “muscle”, and differentiated somites.  
   • Cardiac myocardium.  
   Moderate accessibility: presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and early somites, reflecting precursor activity; low / absent in non-mesodermal tissues (e.g. pronephros, epidermis).

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Associated-gene list is enriched for:  
   • Sarcomeric / contractile machinery (mylk3, vcl, myo18ab, myo9ab, actin regulators, collagens).  
   • Muscle/heart signalling & maturation factors (mef2cb, tbx5b, gata4/5/6, srfa/srfb, tead1b).  
   • Cytoskeleton- and ECM-remodelling genes important for myofibril assembly and cardiomyocyte morphogenesis.  
   Together with the temporal pattern, this points to enhancers that drive terminal differentiation and functional assembly of skeletal muscle fibres and embryonic myocardium.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and TF-mapping highlight canonical muscle/heart regulators:  
   • MEF2 family (mef2ab/b/c/d) – sarcomere gene activation.  
   • SRF (srfa/srfb) and TEAD1/TEAD3 – actin–myosin and Hippo–Yap–Tead control of muscle growth.  
   • Myogenic bHLH factors (myod1, myog, myf5/6) and TCF/LEF (for Wnt-responsive myogenesis).  
   • Cardiac TFs: TBX5/20, GATA4/5/6, NKX2-5, HAND2.  
   • Proliferation–coupled E2F/FOXM1 motifs suggest cycling myoblasts just prior to terminal differentiation.

Taken together, peak-cluster 6_5 marks late-stage, muscle- and heart-specific enhancers that switch on between 20 and 30 somites to orchestrate myofibril assembly, contraction machinery expression and final maturation of the zebrafish musculoskeletal and cardiac systems.
]

## Cluster 7_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 7_0 corresponds to a broad “neuronal differentiation/maturation” chromatin module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0–5-somite stages and remains high through 20 somites.  
   • It falls sharply in many non-neural tissues by 30 somites, but stays high in differentiating-neuron pseudobulks (e.g. differentiating_neurons_30somites = 1.46 vs PSM_30somites = 0).  
   ⇒ The module is most active from early neurulation through early organogenesis and is retained only in maturing neuronal lineages at 24 hpf.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Differentiating neurons / generic neurons  
   • CNS territories: hindbrain, spinal cord, midbrain-hindbrain boundary, telencephalon, optic cup  
   • Early neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs) show accessibility that wanes by 30 somites  
   • Virtually absent in mesodermal (PSM/somite) and endodermal derivatives at late stages

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Gene set is enriched for:  
   – Neurotransmitter receptors and ion-channel genes (GRIN2, GABRB2, CACNA*, KCN*),  
   – Synaptic vesicle/active-zone components (UNC13B, RIMS, SV2, SNAP25),  
   – Axon-guidance/adhesion molecules (L1CAM family, NRXN2/3, CNTN-, NLGN-, ROBO/SLIT),  
   – Activity-dependent TFs (NPAS3, CREB family).  
   GO/KEGG terms would centre on: neurogenesis, axonogenesis, synapse organisation, electrical excitability.  
   Thus cluster 7_0 marks enhancers/promoters that collectively launch and sustain the transition from generic neural progenitor to electrically active, synaptically connected neuron.

4. Likely driver transcription factors (motifs highly enriched & matching expressed factors)  
   • Proneural bHLH: NeuroD1/2/4, Atoh1/7, Neurogenins, Olig2  
   • SoxB & SoxC: Sox2/3/11/21 – maintain neural identity and promote neurite outgrowth  
   • Homeobox AP-patterning and neuronal subtype factors: Pax6, Lhx1/2/5/9, Otx/Crx, Uncx, Vsx1, multiple Hox-PBX/MEIS combinations (consistent with segment-specific spinal/cranial neurons)  
   • Ebf family & Tcf4 (Tcf12) – neuronal differentiation and synaptic gene activation  
   • CREB/ATF & NPAS – activity-dependent maturation  
   • MEF2 – late neuronal activity / synapse pruning

Together these TFs form a cascade: Sox/Proneural factors open the loci early, Hox/Pax/Lhx refine positional identity, and activity-dependent CREB/MEF2 complexes keep the elements accessible in firing neurons.

In summary, peak-cluster 7_0 encodes the regulatory backbone for pan-neuronal gene expression that initiates during early neurulation, peaks as neurons differentiate, and is selectively retained in mature neuronal cell types by 24 hpf.
]

## Cluster 7_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 7_1 is best interpreted as the “constitutive-promoter” cluster of the atlas.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Already open at the first sampled stage (10 hpf; 0-somite) but accessibility rises steadily (≈10–20 % increase) and reaches a maximum at the late 20-/30-somite stages (≈24 hpf).  
   • The gradual increase matches the global surge in zygotic/organogenetic transcription rather than a pulse restricted to a single developmental window.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Accessible in virtually every lineage examined.  
   • Highest signals are seen in differentiated derivatives at 30 som (endocrine-pancreas > endoderm ≈ fast-muscle ≈ differentiating-neurons ≈ neurons).  
   • No lineage is uniquely enriched, indicating that the regions are shared regulatory elements rather than lineage-restricted enhancers.

3. Regulatory program represented  
   • Peaks overlap the promoters (and immediate gene-body 5′ regions) of >10 000 genes, including housekeeping genes and a broad spectrum of tissue-specific loci (e.g. myod1, pax genes, hox genes, gata genes).  
   • They therefore represent the core chromatin state that supports basal Pol II loading, RNA-processing, metabolic and cell-cycle programmes needed in all cells, with a modest up-shift as cells exit gastrulation and commence organogenesis.

4. Key transcription factors  
   • Motif analysis shows little positive enrichment (all motifs have slightly negative Z-scores), a signature of CpG-rich, nucleosome-depleted promoters rather than enhancer modules.  
   • The motifs that are least depleted (closest to neutral) are those bound by general promoter factors: SP/KLF family (Sp1/Klf4/13), NF-Y, YY1, E2F, NRF1, RFX and CTCF.  
   • These factors – together with TBP/TFIID and the basal machinery – are the likely drivers that keep this cluster constitutively open; lineage TFs (Sox, Fox, Hox, etc.) are present in the motif list only because their promoters reside in this cluster, not because they open the chromatin.

In summary, peak-cluster 7_1 comprises ubiquitously accessible promoter regions that progressively gain accessibility during the gastrula-to-organogenesis transition and serve as a common transcriptional platform across virtually all emerging zebrafish cell types.

## Cluster 7_2

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 7_2 behaves like a transient, genome-wide “patterning enhancer wave” that sweeps through the embryo during the mid-somite stage.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low and fairly constant (≈0.35–0.5) from 0-, 5- and 10-somite stages, spikes sharply at the 15-somite stage (values 1.8–2.7 in every lineage), and drops back to baseline by 20- and 30-somites.  
   • The 15-somite stage (≈18–19 hpf) corresponds to the zebrafish phylotypic/early-organogenesis period when most organs initiate overt differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • The spike is pan-tissue but most pronounced in endodermal and mesendodermal derivatives (endoderm, endocrine-pancreas, hatching gland, pronephros, heart, somites/PSM) and in neural crest / spinal cord.  
   • Thus the cluster marks a global but developmentally coordinated burst of chromatin opening rather than a lineage-restricted program.

3. Regulatory program inferred from associated genes  
   • Gene set is heavily enriched for pattern-formation and early differentiation factors (Pbx1/2/3/4, Hox paralogs, Prrx1/2, Uncx, Lhx/Msx/Dlx/Isl, Tbx family, Pax genes) plus guidance/ECM/neurogenic genes (Tenm2, Unc5c, Rims2, Grm7, Adamts, Col genes).  
   • Functional themes:  
     – Anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral positional identity (HOX/PBX, LHX, MSX, DLX, IRX).  
     – Initiation of organ primordia (Pdx1 – pancreas, Isl1/2 – heart & neurons, Pax6/7 – neural/eye, Nkx2 family – endoderm & brain).  
     – Early axon guidance and synaptogenesis (Rims2, Unc5c, Grm7, Neurod6).  
     – Matrix remodelling and morphogenesis (Adamts, Col, Angpt).

4. Key transcription factors/motifs enriched  
   • Patterning TFs: HOX (multiple HoxA/B/C/D motifs), PBX/MEIS, LHX, MSX, DLX, IRX, PAX, SIX, TBX.  
   • Germ-layer pioneers: FOX (FoxA/D/F/K family), SOX (Sox2/3/5/10/11/17/19), GATA (Gata4/5/6).  
   • Chromatin priming factors: Kdm2ba/CXXC1 (CpG-binding, found as the sole “direct” hit), CTCF/YY1 (architectural).  
   • Cell-cycle/E2F motifs are present but moderate, fitting the transient genome-wide opening during rapid proliferation.  

Overall interpretation  
Peak cluster 7_2 represents a cohort of regulatory elements that become simultaneously accessible across the embryo at ~15 somites to allow broad deployment of positional-identity and organ-initiation gene programs. The wave is driven by classical embryonic patterning transcription factors (HOX–PBX/MEIS axis, FOX/SOX/GATA pioneers, PAX/IRX/LHX/MSX/DLX families) and appears to license multiple germ-layer derivatives for the onset of overt differentiation during early organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 7_3

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 7_3 marks one of the “neuro-epithelial / eye-field” regulatory modules in the embryo.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already detectable at 0–5 somites but rises sharply during mid-segmentation (10–20 somites ≈ 14–19 hpf).  
• In most tissues it falls again by 30 somites (24 hpf), but remains very high in optic-cup derivatives, indicating continued use of the module during retinogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest scores)  
• Optic cup / retinal progenitors (values >8–10, the strongest signal in the whole matrix).  
• Anterior neural tube derivatives – midbrain–hindbrain boundary, hind-/fore-brain, spinal cord, differentiating neurons.  
• Moderate early use in neuromesodermal progenitors and paraxial mesoderm, but these decline later.  
• Low or absent in late mesodermal organs (heart, muscle) and endoderm-derived tissues.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
The associated gene set is enriched for:  
• Eye / forebrain specification and early retinogenesis (rpe65a, opn4xb, pax6-motif hits, vsx1, crx-motif, rx1/3, six3/6, otx2).  
• Generic neural differentiation and axon-guidance genes (neurod cluster, cntn2/3, robo1, epha4, sema3/6, shank, nrxn, grm family).  
• Extracellular-matrix and basement-membrane components typical of optic stalk and cranio-facial mesenchyme (col11a1b, col12a1a, adamts6/7, mmp15b, tnc).  
• Retinoic-acid / nuclear-receptor targets (rar, rxr, rorb, ror2) consistent with RA-dependent eye morphogenesis.  
Together these point to a programme that sets up eye-field identity, organizes retinal neuro-epithelium and supports early neuronal maturation and path-finding.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs enriched and matching factors)  
• Pax family – Pax6, Pax2/3/7 (multiple PAX motif clusters 23, 33, 54, 111). Essential for optic-cup and forebrain patterning.  
• SoxB group – Sox2/3/19, Sox11, Sox4/14 (clusters 35, 61, 63). Maintain neuro-epithelial competence and promote neuron birth.  
• Six/Rx/Crx/Otx axis – Six3/6, Rx1/3, Crx, Otx1/2 motifs present (clusters 17, 52), hallmark of eye-field and photoreceptor programmes.  
• Irx/Lhx/Msx/Dlx homeobox factors – pattern dorsal neural tube and cranial neural crest (clusters 7, 25, 30, 48, 68, 73).  
• Fox family – FoxG1, FoxD1/3, FoxC1, FoxP (cluster 68, 107) for telencephalon, optic-stalk and neural-crest inputs.  
• Nuclear receptors – RAR/RXR, ROR, NR2F1/2 (clusters 11, 26, 31, 57, 77) integrating retinoic-acid signalling.  
• bHLH neurogenic factors – Atoh1/7, NeuroD1/4/6, Olig2 (clusters 15, 42) driving neuronal commitment.

In summary, peak cluster 7_3 corresponds to a chromatin module that becomes highly accessible during mid-somitogenesis in anterior neural/optic tissues, orchestrating the transcriptional network for optic-cup formation and early neuronal differentiation, principally controlled by a Pax-Six-Sox-Fox homeobox/bHLH TF ensemble modulated by retinoic-acid receptors.

## Cluster 7_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 7_4 represents a large set of constitutively open, promoter-proximal regions that drive the core transcriptional programme of rapidly proliferating embryonic cells.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at the earliest sampled stage (0-somite, 10 hpf) and remains maximal through the main segmentation window (5–20 somites, 11–19 hpf).  
• Signal falls noticeably in many lineages by 30 somites (≈24 hpf), indicating that these regions close as cells exit the cell-cycle and differentiate.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is seen in highly proliferative, undifferentiated compartments:  
• axial progenitors – neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) and presomitic mesoderm (PSM)  
• early neuro-epithelium / differentiating neurons, neural crest, spinal cord  
• mesendodermal progenitors (early heart, endoderm, lateral plate)  
Accessibility is lowest or lost earliest in slowly dividing/external tissues such as mature epidermis, epidermal derivatives (hatching gland, epidermis 30 som), and primordial germ cells.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
The enormous, genome-wide gene list is enriched for:  
• cell-cycle and DNA-replication factors (e2f, mcm, pcna, cdc genes)  
• generic transcription/RNA-processing machinery (taf/tbp, pol II subunits, splicing factors)  
• basal metabolic genes (glycolysis, TCA, ribosomal protein genes)  
Together with its broad accessibility, this points to a “house-keeping / proliferative” chromatin module that supplies the core molecular toolkit required for rapid embryonic divisions before lineage-specific programmes take over.

4. Key transcription-factor motifs driving the cluster  
Motif enrichment and TF–motif mapping highlight TF families that underpin this generic proliferative state:  
• E2F family (E2F1/2/3/4/5/7/8) – canonical activators of S-phase genes.  
• CHR/FOX/KLF/SP families (FOXO1/3/4, FOXK1/2, KLF4/6/8 etc.) – general promoters of growth and metabolic genes.  
• ETS factors (ELK/ELF/ETV/Fli1/ERG) – reinforce transcriptional output at active promoters.  
• Nuclear receptors of the RAR/RXR/NR2F family – broad integrators of retinoid and metabolic signalling that remain active in many progenitors.  
• SOX / IRX / PAX motifs appear but are ubiquitous across the developing neuro-mesoderm and likely reflect mixed cell-type input rather than cluster specificity.  
• Architectural factors CTCF/YY1 and the chromatin reader KDM2 (CxxC DNA-binding) are also enriched, consistent with promoter-linked, CpG-rich, constitutively open regions.

In summary, cluster 7_4 marks promoter-like elements that stay accessible in rapidly dividing embryonic cells across many germ layers, are gradually shut down as differentiation proceeds, and are driven by the universal proliferative TF ensemble dominated by E2Fs, FOX/KLF, ETS and basal nuclear receptors.
]

## Cluster 7_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 7_5 marks a mid-embryonic regulatory module that first operates in axial mesoderm (notochord) and is later reutilised by definitive endoderm derivatives, in particular the nascent endocrine pancreas.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Highest signal is already present at 0–10-somite stages in notochord and endoderm (Endoderm_0 = 6.6; Notochord_0 = 10.8).  
• Accessibility keeps rising in endoderm through 20- and 30-somite stages (Endoderm_30 ≈ 17) and in endocrine-pancreatic progenitors (from 5.4 to 9.6).  
• By 30 somites accessibility has fallen in neuromesodermal progenitors / PSM (≤ 1.1) but peaks in gut-lineage cells, indicating a developmental hand-over from axial mesoderm to foregut/endocrine organ programs.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Early axial mesoderm: Notochord (0–20 somites).  
• Definitive endoderm / foregut tube.  
• Endocrine-pancreas lineage (increasing 5 → 30 somites).  
Moderate signal is seen in floor plate and hindbrain, consistent with shared midline/foregut transcriptional circuitry.

3. Inferred regulatory program  
Gene and motif content point to:  
• Midline patterning and notochord differentiation (noto, foxa2, lhx1/5, shh-associated factors).  
• Foregut specification and pancreatic endocrine commitment (pd​x1, rfx6, onecut1/2/3, hnf4a/g, gata4/5/6, foxa1/2/3).  
• ECM remodelling and epithelium morphogenesis (multiple collagens, lama1, itgb4, tgfa, tln1).  
Thus cluster 7_5 likely contains enhancers driving transition from axial mesoderm identity to foregut-endocrine organogenesis.

4. Key enriched transcription factors  
Motif enrichment + gene list converge on:  
• Forkhead factors: FOXA1/2/3, FOXC1, FOXF1/2, FOXD1/3/5 – master regulators of notochord and foregut.  
• GATA4/5/6 – required for endoderm and pancreas.  
• HNF4A/G & HNF1A/B – gut epithelium maturation.  
• PDX1, RFX6, ONECUT1/2 – endocrine-pancreas specification.  
• NOTO & LHX family (LHX1/5, MNX1/2) – notochord/ventral neural tube.  
• HOX / CDX class – anteroposterior foregut patterning.  

Together these factors define a developmental cascade that starts in the notochord and is redeployed to establish foregut-derived organs, with cluster 7_5 harbouring the shared cis-regulatory scaffold.
]

## Cluster 7_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 7_6 represents a set of “house-keeping / promoter-like” regulatory elements that stay open in virtually every cell during early zebrafish development.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at the first sampled stage (0-somite, 10 hpf) and remains high through 30-somite (≈ 24 hpf).  
• The values vary little (≈ 2.0-2.7) between successive stages, indicating a constitutively open state rather than a stage-restricted burst.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• Nearly all cell types score >2, but the largest values are seen in highly proliferative, posterior progenitor populations (neuromesodermal progenitors, tail-bud, paraxial mesoderm/PSM, early somites).  
• Late-differentiating, low-proliferation tissues (e.g. epidermis 30 s, mature blood/vasculature) show the few sub-threshold (≈0) values.  
• Conclusion: peaks are broadly accessible but most pronounced in dividing progenitors.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
• The gene list is enormous and dominated by ribosomal proteins, translation factors, metabolic enzymes, membrane transporters and cell-cycle regulators.  
• GO/KEGG themes: DNA replication, RNA processing, protein translation, oxidative metabolism – the core biosynthetic machinery required by every cell.  
• Together with the ubiquity of the peaks, this points to canonical CpG-island promoters that drive basal transcriptional programmes.

4. Key transcription-factor signatures  
Enrichment pattern is characteristic of generic promoter/CpG-island binding factors rather than lineage TFs:  
• Kdm2b / CxxC-domain proteins (row “direct = kdm2ba”) – bind unmethylated CpG-islands, keep them hypomethylated and accessible.  
• E2F family, MYBL, FOXM1 – controller set for S-phase and proliferation, consistent with higher signal in cycling progenitors.  
• NF-Y / SP / KLF / YY1 / TBP core-promoter factors – classic constituents of ubiquitously active promoters.  
• CTCF/Rest motifs are also present, reflecting architectural/insulator roles around active promoter regions.

Overall interpretation  
Cluster 7_6 marks constitutively open, CpG-rich promoter elements that underpin basic cellular biosynthetic and cell-cycle programmes.  Accessibility is highest in rapidly dividing embryonic progenitors but is maintained across virtually all lineages from gastrulation through early organogenesis, supplying the transcriptional infrastructure required for growth and differentiation.
]

## Cluster 7_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 7_7 = the “fast-skeletal-muscle” module

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already elevated at the 0-somite stage (10 hpf) but rises steadily and reaches a clear maximum between 10–30 somites (~14-24 hpf).  
   • This coincides with segmental myotome formation and the terminal differentiation/maturation of fast–twitch fibres.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest values)  
   • Fast muscle (all time points; 3.7–5.5 a.u.)  
   • Generic “muscle” cluster (4–6 a.u.) and differentiated “somites” (>3 a.u.)  
   • Paraxial mesoderm / PSM and NMPs show moderate signal; most non-mesodermal lineages stay near baseline.  
   → The peak set therefore marks the somitic/fast-skeletal lineage, not cardiac, smooth-muscle or neural derivatives.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Associated genes are strongly enriched for structural and Ca²⁺-handling components of adult‐type fast fibres (TNNC2, ACTC1, MYL1/13, MYHZ1, RYR1/3, CACNA1/2 subunits, SGCD/SGCG, TNNI/TNNT family, XIRP2, TTMN, etc.).  
   • Additional hits (MEF2C, MYO18, MYOZ2, VGLL2, LMOD, ACTN-binding proteins) point to sarcomere assembly, excitation–contraction coupling and fibre-type specification.  
   • Pathway signature: myogenic differentiation, sarcomerogenesis, metabolic switch to glycolytic “fast” muscle.

4. Key transcription factors driving the programme  
   Motif enrichment + TF–gene presence converge on the canonical myogenic cascade:  
   • Early progenitor phase – Pax3/Pax7 & E-box bHLH priming (Pax3a/b, Pax7a/b motifs).  
   • Commitment – Myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs): Myod1, Myf5, Myf6, Myog (bHLH/E-box motifs, cluster 41).  
   • Maturation – MEF2 family (Mef2ca/cb/d, motifs cluster 10 & 113) cooperating with SRF.  
   • Fibre-type modulation – TEAD/VGLL2, Six1/4, Runx1/3, and Hippo-related co-factors.  
   • Cell-cycle exit support – E2F repression motifs, Kdm2/Cxxc chromatin readers.

Together these data define peak-cluster 7_7 as a fast-skeletal-muscle–specific regulatory module that becomes progressively accessible during somitogenesis, orchestrated by the Pax–MRF–MEF2 axis to activate the structural and functional gene set of mature fast-twitch myofibres.
]

## Cluster 7_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 7_8 marks the chromatin programme of primordial germ cells (PGCs)

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is low at 0-somite and explodes at 5-somite (~11–12 hpf; 27-fold above background).  
• It collapses again by 10-somite and shows a modest secondary rise at 20-somite (~19 hpf; 2-fold).  
→ The cluster is therefore transient and confined to early-mid somitogenesis, matching the window when PGCs leave the yolk syncytial layer and migrate towards the gonadal ridge.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• The only lineage with a true “spike” is primordial-germ-cells_5 somites (27.6).  
• All somatic populations hover around basal values (~1.3-1.8) indicating background coverage.  
• Minor signal (~2) at PGCs_20 somites reinforces the PGC identity; other tissues do not exceed background.  
→ Specific for PGCs rather than for any somatic tissue.

3. Regulatory/biological programme inferred  
Associated gene set is enriched for classical germ-line factors:  
• piwil2 (piwi), ddx4 (vasa), nanos-related RNA-binding proteins, dazl-like factors, tdrd-family helicases, prdm genes, nanog etc.  
• GO terms that dominate: “piRNA metabolic process”, “germ-cell development”, “meiosis I”, “transposon silencing”, “RNA helicase activity”.  
Physiologically this cluster corresponds to activation of the piRNA/​germ-plasm machinery and the transcriptional reboot that accompanies PGC migration and the first mitotic divisions.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene presence)  
Highest positive motif Z-scores and concurrent TF expression point to:  
• Sox family – Sox19b/3/2/14/5 (motifs highly enriched; sox genes expressed).  
• Fox family – FoxK2, FoxD3, FoxL1/2, FoxC1/​FoxI3 (multiple FOX motifs, many FOX genes present).  
• Nanog and Pou-class pluripotency factors (nanog and pou2f1b genes present; OCT/SOX motif combination).  
• Klf (Klf17/9/11) – typical for germ-line/open-chromatin states.  
• Nr5a2 / Nr5a1 nuclear-receptor motifs – regulators of sterol metabolism and germ-cell fate.  
• Prdm/Blimp-related zinc-finger (prdm2b etc.) – epigenetic priming of the germ line.

Together these TFs create a Fox/Sox/Nanog-centred, pluripotency-like network that opens piRNA- and meiosis-related loci while keeping somatic differentiation genes inaccessible.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 7_8 is a short-lived, PGC-exclusive regulatory module that peaks at 5-somite stage, drives expression of germ-plasm/piRNA genes and is controlled by a Fox-/Sox-/Nanog-dominated transcriptional circuitry.
]

## Cluster 7_9

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 7_9 – concise interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is fairly flat (~1.2–1.7) in most lineages but shows a single, striking spike (22-fold above background) at the 20-somite stage.  
• That stage corresponds to ~19–20 hpf, when the optic vesicle has invaginated and the optic cup begins stratifying.  
• Accessibility falls back to baseline by 30 somites (~24 hpf), indicating that these cis-elements act during a short developmental window.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• The 22-fold peak occurs in the optic-cup / neural-optic pseudobulk; all other cell types stay at baseline.  
• Minor elevation (still <2-fold) is seen in generic neural tube / differentiating-neuron pseudobulks, but no other germ-layer derivatives.  
⇒ Cluster 7_9 marks regulatory DNA that is highly specific to the nascent retina/RPE.

3. Likely biological programme  
• Gene set is heavily enriched for eye-field and early retinal genes (rx1/2/3, pax6a/b, vsx1/2, otx1/2, six3/6, lhx2, crx, nrl, mitfa/b, tfec) plus photoreceptor and neuronal signalling genes (ion channels, glutamate & GABA receptors, opsins).  
• GO/pathway implication: optic-cup morphogenesis, retinal neurogenesis, photoreceptor specification, pigment-epithelium differentiation, axon-guidance onset.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif & gene co-expression)  
High-confidence direct or indirect motif hits that are themselves expressed in the optic cup at 20 hpf:  
• Eye-field / retinal TFs Pax6, Rx (Rax), Vsx1/2, Sox2/3, Six3/6, Lhx2, Otx1/2  
• RPE / photoreceptor TFs Mitf (mitfa/mitfb/tfec), Crx, Nrl, Maf family, Nr2e3  
• Broad neural regulators FoxG1, FoxD3/FoxL1/FoxP, Meis/Pknox, E2F (transient proliferation).  

Together these factors can account for the short, optic-cup-restricted burst of accessibility and the downstream gene programme driving early eye formation.
]

## Cluster 7_10

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 7_10 represents a late-segmentation “neuro-secretory maturation” module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at early somitogenesis (0–10 somites) and rises steadily, peaking at 20- to 30-somite embryos (≈ 22–24 hpf).  
   • The ∼30 % gain seen in most lineages at 30 somites (e.g. differentiating-neurons 1.62, endocrine-pancreas 1.69, neural ectoderm 1.58) indicates that the underlying cis-elements become fully open only during early organogenesis, once cells start to acquire mature physiological functions.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in derivatives that require regulated vesicle exocytosis:  
   • Neural lineages – differentiating neurons (brain, spinal cord, optic cup), hindbrain, telencephalon, neural crest–derived neurons.  
   • Secretory endoderm – endocrine pancreas, entero-endocrine/enteric neuron precursors.  
   • Low-to-moderate signal in mesodermal tissues and early PSM; almost absent in purely structural cell types (fast muscle, notochord, epidermis).

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
   The gene set is heavily enriched for:  
   • Synapse / neuro-secretory machinery – SNAP25, STX1A, STXBP1, SYT family, RIMS, RIMBP2, ELAVL2/4, UNC13, SV2, MUNC13, SLC8A/6A/12A transporters.  
   • Voltage-gated channels and neurotransmitter receptors – large arrays of CACNA, KCN, SCN, GRIA/K/M, GABR genes.  
   • Axon guidance / adhesion – NRXN1-3, CNTNAPs, TENM2, SORCS3, L1-family, CNTN, ROBO1.  
   • Secretory/endocrine regulators – PDX1 partners (ISL1, NKX2‐2), RAB, RAMP, ANGPTL2, SLC30 (Zn transport) etc.  
   Together these point to a programme that equips neurons (and endocrine β-like cells) for electrical excitability, Ca²⁺-triggered vesicle fusion, and synaptic/secretory connectivity.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs enriched)  
   • Proneural / bHLH: NEUROD1/2/4/6, ATOH1/7, ASCL1 – initiate neuronal differentiation and synaptic gene expression.  
   • Homeobox patterning factors: PAX6/7, LHX2/9, DLX1/2/5/6, BARHL, TLX – refine regional neuronal identity and axon targeting.  
   • Fork-head and SOX families (FOXG1, FOXP1/2, FOXD3, SOX4/11/14/21) – maintain neural competence and neuro-secretory maturation; FOXP/FOXG1 links shared neuron-pancreas secretory programmes.  
   • MEF2 and NR (COUP-TF/NR2F, ROR, RAR/RXR) motifs – associated with later neuronal maturation, activity-dependent gene sets and retinoid responsiveness.  
   • BACH/MAF, CREB/ATF and RFX motifs – support secretory vesicle, circadian and cilia/axoneme components often co-regulated in neuro-endocrine cells.

In summary, peak cluster 7_10 encodes late-acting enhancers that turn on a broad neuro-secretory gene set.  Accessibility rises as embryos transition from patterning to functional maturation (≈20–24 hpf) and is highest in differentiating neurons and hormone-secreting pancreatic cells.  Proneural bHLH, PAX/LHX homeobox, FOX/SOX and MEF2/NR TFs are the principal regulators orchestrating this programme.
]

## Cluster 7_11

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 7_11 highlights the chromatin program that turns on when early post-mitotic neurons start wiring up the embryonic nervous system.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low at 0 som (10 hpf), rises sharply by 5–10 som (12–14 hpf), and peaks between 15–30 som (18–24 hpf).  
   • This trajectory matches the onset of neuronal differentiation and the first wave of synaptogenesis that characterise mid- to late-somite stages.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest scores)  
   • Differentiating neurons (all regional subclasses) – strongest signal, steadily increasing across time-points.  
   • Enteric neurons – parallel rise, slightly lagging behind spinal/hindbrain neurons.  
   • Moderate in general “neurons”, hindbrain, spinal cord and neural crest-derived neuroblasts.  
   • Near-baseline in mesodermal, endodermal or progenitor (NMP/PSM) populations.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Gene set is heavily enriched for neuronal adhesion/axon-guidance receptors (CNTN, NCAM, L1/IGSF, PCDH clusters), synaptic vesicle and active-zone components (SNAP25, SYT1, RIMS2, CADPS), ion-channel subunits (multiple voltage-gated Ca²⁺ and K⁺ channels, GRIK/GRIA/GRIN glutamate receptors, GABA-A/B receptors), and signalling modulators (RET, NRGs, FGFs).  
   → Together these point to:  
     • Terminal differentiation of glutamatergic / cholinergic neurons  
     • Axon path-finding and fasciculation  
     • Assembly and maturation of chemical synapses.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs & mapping)  
   • Proneural/basic-helix–loop–helix: ATOH/NEUROD/NGN, OLIG2 – initiate neuronal fate and neurite outgrowth.  
   • SOX cluster (SOX2/5/11/19/21) – maintain neurogenic competence, activate cytoskeletal/synaptic genes.  
   • LIM / HOX / DLX homeodomain factors (LHX1/2/9, PBX/MEIS, DLX, regional HOX paralogs) – confer axial and subtype identity.  
   • FOX family (FOXP1/2, FOXG, FOXC) – axon guidance, forebrain patterning.  
   • MEF2 & NFAT motifs – activity-dependent maturation of synapses.  
   • Nuclear receptors NR2F/COUP-TF & ROR – late neuronal subtype specification.

In summary, peak cluster 7_11 represents a neuron-specific, late-somite chromatin program that coordinates regional identity cues with the core machinery needed for axon extension and synapse formation, driven by a combinatorial network of proneural bHLH, SOX, LIM/HOX, FOX and activity-responsive TFs.
]

## Cluster 7_12

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 7_12 captures the chromatin programme that turns on when the neural tube starts to differentiate into mature spinal-cord neurons.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low–moderate from 0-15 somites and rises sharply after 20 somites, reaching a clear maximum at 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • The >5-fold signal in “spinal_cord_30somites” (5.66 vs. ~1 baseline) marks the late-neurulation / early-organogenesis window.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in neural-tube–derived populations at late stages:  
   • spinal cord ≫ hindbrain, floor plate, posterior neural tube, differentiating neurons, midbrain-hindbrain boundary.  
   • Mesodermal/endodermal lineages (PSM, NMPs, endoderm, muscle, etc.) show little or no signal, indicating neural restriction.

3. Likely biological processes regulated  
   Associated gene set is heavily enriched for neuronal maturation functions:  
   • Axonogenesis / guidance (L1cam-family, Robo, Unc5, Ntrk2/3, Runx, Lhx, Mnx genes)  
   • Synapse assembly & neurotransmission (Adarb2, Erbb4, Gria/Grik/Grin receptors, Rims2/3, Slc6a11, GABRB2, Cadm/Cntl genes)  
   • Ion-channel activity and excitability (Cacna1/2/4, Kcnq5, Hcn4, Ryr1/2).  
   • Transcriptional regulators of spinal neuronal subtype identity (Pax6/7, Irx1/3/5, Nkx2.2/2.4, Mnx1/2, Lhx1/2/8/9).  
   Altogether the cluster represents the switch from proliferative neuroepithelium to post-mitotic, synaptically competent spinal neurons.

4. Key transcription factors driving the programme  
   Motif enrichment and TF-gene presence highlight four cooperating modules:  
   • Patterning/homeodomain module – Pax6, Pax3/7, Irx (1/3/5/7), Nkx2.2/2.4, Uncx, Lhx (1/2/8/9), Mnx1/2: set up dorsoventral and rostro-caudal spinal identities.  
   • Proneural / basic-helix–loop–helix – Atoh1/7, Olig2, NeuroD1/2/4/6, Neurog3: trigger neuronal cell-cycle exit and neurogenic differentiation.  
   • Synaptic-maturation / activity-dependent – MEF2 (mef2a/b/c/d), NFAT (nfatc1/2/3/4), CREB/ATF family: promote axonal growth, synapse formation and activity-responsive genes.  
   • Sox/Fox maintenance factors – Sox2/3/11/21, Foxg1/Foxp1/2/4, FOXK2: keep neural chromatin competent while steering toward neuronal fate.

In summary, peak-cluster 7_12 is a late-neurogenic, spinal-cord-biased chromatin module that coordinates transcription factors required for neuronal subtype specification and the onset of synaptic function during zebrafish embryogenesis.

## Cluster 7_13

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 7_13 represents a large set of broadly accessible, promoter-rich regions that behave like “house-keeping” chromatin.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Already open at the earliest sampled stage (10 hpf; 0–5 somites).  
   • Accessibility rises modestly during segmentation (10–20 somites) and stays high through early organogenesis (30 somites / 24 hpf).  
   • No sharp on/off switch – the cluster is constitutively active once zygotic transcription is established.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Accessibility values are high (≈ 1.2–1.7) in virtually every lineage examined – differentiating neurons, muscle, epidermis, endoderm, vasculature, pancreas, heart, etc.  
   • Slightly lower in very early axial progenitors (NMPs) and tail-bud, suggesting opening accompanies, rather than precedes, lineage commitment.  
   • Conclusion: the regions are \"ubiquitous\" rather than lineage-restricted.

3. Regulatory program inferred  
   • Gene list is overwhelmingly enriched for core metabolic, translational, cytoskeletal and signaling genes (thousands of loci).  
   • GO/GSEA (implicit) would return “cellular metabolic process”, “RNA processing”, “protein translation”, “chromatin organisation”, “cell cycle”.  
   • Hence the cluster most likely contains CpG-island promoters and adjacent proximal enhancers that drive basal, cell-essential transcription across the embryo.

4. Key transcription factors  
   (No single lineage driver – instead, classical promoter-binding factors dominate)  
   • General factors: SP/KLF family (Sp1/2/3, Klf2/4/6/9), NF-Y (NFYA/L), YY1, GABPA/ETS, NRF/NR2F, TBP/TFII-D components, NF-κB (Rel), CREB/ATF, CTCF.  
   • CpG-island binders: KDM2B/CXXC-motif factors, REST/ZNF143/CTCF.  
   • Cell-cycle / growth regulators: E2F1-4-7, FOXM1, MYRF-E2F network.  
   • Motif spectrum also contains ubiquitous pioneer families (FOX, SOX, GATA) which readily appear in open promoters.

In summary, peak cluster 7_13 corresponds to constitutively open promoter/proximal regulatory elements that support the core transcriptional machinery required in every zebrafish embryonic cell once differentiation begins.

## Cluster 8_0

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 8_0 captures a broad “early-specification” enhancer program that is switched on during the earliest segmentation stages and then progressively shut down as organs begin to mature.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is maximal between 0-10 somites (≈10–14 hpf).  
• Signal weakens by 15-20 somites (≈17–20 hpf) and is largely silenced by 30 somites (24 hpf).  
→ The cluster marks regulatory regions that are only needed during the first wave of tissue specification.

2. Cell-type specificity (top accessible populations)  
• Midbrain–hindbrain boundary progenitors (MHB) – strongest signal (15.4 at 0 somites).  
• Cranial/ trunk neural-crest cells – equally high (14.4–14.0).  
• Haemato-vascular mesoderm (haemangioblast / haematopoietic-vasculature) – 14.5–13.1.  
• Early endocrine-pancreatic endoderm – 14.0–13.5.  
• Early somites / paraxial mesoderm – 13.7–12.9.  
• Heart myocardium and differentiating neurons show moderate levels.  
→ The program is shared by multiple progenitor fields, particularly those that must migrate, pattern or set up boundaries soon after gastrulation.

3. Regulatory programme and biological functions  
Gene list and motif repertoire converge on four processes.  
a. Anterior neural patterning / MHB formation – pax2a/5/8, en1/en2, fgf8a, otx/gbx, plus Pax, Engrailed and Hox motifs.  
b. Neural-crest induction & EMT – sox10, foxd3, tfap2, snai1/2, cadherin switch genes; AP-1, Sox and Fox motifs.  
c. Early vasculogenesis & blood specification – tal1, gata2/3, etv2/fli1, runx1/3 with GATA, ETS and Runx motifs.  
d. Endodermal organ priming (pancreas, liver, gut) – pdx1, gata4/6, onecut, foxa/f, plus Fox and Onecut motifs.  
All groups are enriched for ECM/cytoskeleton genes (fn1, col5a1, lama5, ptk2) suggesting a shared requirement for cell migration and tissue morphogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (high motif enrichment & matching genes)  
• Forkhead family (FoxA/FoxC/FoxD/FoxG/FoxK) – central hubs for mesendoderm and boundary enhancers.  
• Sox family (Sox2/3/5/10/14/19) – pluripotency-to-lineage transition and neural-crest genes.  
• Pax2/5/8 & Engrailed (En1/2) – MHB organiser.  
• ETS factors (Etv2, Fli1, Erg) – vasculature/blood.  
• GATA (2/3/4/6) & Tal1 – haemato-vascular and endodermal priming.  
• Hox cluster motifs – axial identity and segmentation.  
• E2F/Klf – proliferative burst accompanying early fate commitment.  
Collectively these TFs activate enhancers that set positional identity, initiate lineage-specific gene cascades and equip progenitors for migration and boundary formation.

In summary, peak cluster 8_0 represents a transient, multi-lineage enhancer set that orchestrates early embryonic patterning and progenitor mobilisation across neural (MHB, neural crest), mesodermal (somite, haemangioblast) and endodermal (pancreatic/liver) lineages during 10-20 hpf zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 8_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 8_1 marks an early, trunk-mesodermal chromatin programme that lights up during the somite-forming window and then switches off once definitive organs start to mature.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is highest from 0-20 somites (≈10–20 hpf) and falls sharply by 30 somites (≈24 hpf) in almost every lineage (e.g. NMP 18 → 5, PSM 22 → 16, somites 24 → 1).  
   • The profile therefore tracks the segmentation period and fades as embryogenesis enters overt organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (greatest accessibility)  
   • Presomitic/somitic mesoderm (PSM & nascent somites)  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs)  
   • Early paraxial muscle and notochord; moderate in trunk neuroectoderm; minimal in epidermis/endoderm and largely absent at 30 somites.

3. Inferred biological processes / pathways  
   • Somitogenesis and rostro-caudal patterning – presence of many Hox (A/B/C/D 1-10), Meis/Pbx, Uncx, Tbx6, Runx, Prdm5, Ripply partners, Collagens (Col5/9/11/12/18) and ECM modifiers (Fn1, Fndc, Loxl1).  
   • Early myogenic priming and connective-tissue matrix assembly (Mef2, Tcf/Lef, Wnt5b, Fgf17, Pdlim5, Smad1/3/5 signalling components).  
   • High cell-cycle/E2F and E-box (MyoD/Mrf) motif load suggests rapidly dividing, still-unspecified mesoderm.  
   • Overall, the cluster represents the chromatin state that sets up trunk identity, periodic segmentation and initial myotome differentiation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (high motif enrichment & matching genes)  
   • T-box / segmentation: Tbx6, Tbx16, Tbx18/20  
   • Hox–Meis–Pbx code: extensive anterior-trunk Hox motifs plus Meis1/2/3 and Pbx1/3/4 motifs/genes  
   • Fox family (FoxC1/2, FoxF1/2, FoxD1/3/5, FoxG1) – paraxial mesoderm & axial patterning  
   • Mef2/Srf and MyoD/Myf5 – early myogenic activation  
   • Tcf/Lef and β-catenin (Wnt pathway) plus Smad1/3/5 (BMP/TGF-β) motifs – signalling integration for segmentation clocks  
   • E2F/FOX M1 cluster – proliferative drive of NMP/PSM cells.

Taken together, peak-cluster 8_1 defines the early segmentation/para-axial mesoderm regulatory landscape, peaking during active somite formation and tapering as tissues exit the segmentation clock and commit to specialised muscle, skeletal and neural derivatives.
]

## Cluster 8_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 8_2 marks a neural enhancer program that switches on as soon as the neural tube begins to regionalise and peaks while first neurons are being born.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises sharply from the 5- to 20-somite stages (≈13-18 hpf) across most neural tissues and then subsides by 30 somites (24 hpf).  
   • Example: hindbrain 0 s 12.9 → 10 s 16.6 → 20 s 17.0 → 30 s 14.9; midbrain–hindbrain boundary 0 s 12.6 → 20 s 17.5 → 30 s 17.4.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest log-accessibility)  
   • Midbrain-hindbrain boundary & hindbrain (rhombomeres)  
   • Differentiating neurons / generic “neurons” pools  
   • Spinal cord & floor plate  
   • Neural crest and posterior neural tube show intermediate signal; mesoderm/endoderm, muscle, epidermis are low.

3. Biological / regulatory programme inferred  
   • Hindbrain and midbrain patterning (rhombomere identity, MHB organiser)  
   • Onset of primary neurogenesis: neuronal fate commitment, axon guidance, neurotransmitter loading (e.g. SLC18A1, NPAS3, LHX3, EPH/EFN, CADM/NCAM, ROBO, CNTN genes in the correlated list).  
   • Hox-code-driven anterior-posterior specification, coupled with Pax/En/Gbx boundary formation.  
   • Early neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis genes (agrn, slit1a, sema3/4, plxns) are coherently co-accessible.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene list)  
   • Regional patterning: HOX cluster members (Hoxb1/2/3, Hoxa2, Hoxd4/9/10), Pbx/Meis cofactors, En1/En2, Gbx1/2.  
   • Boundary & neural tube TFs: Pax2/5/6/7, Otx/Gbx opposition, Uncx, Irx family.  
   • Core neural stem & early neuron factors: SoxB (Sox2/3/19), SoxE (Sox10), Zic1/3/5, Fox (Foxd3/Foxp1), Lhx/Lbx, Dlx/Msx, Neuro-bHLH (Atoh1, NeuroD, Olig2, Ascl1).  
   • Activity/TGF-β responders that shape neuronal differentiation: CREB/ATF, NFAT, MEF2.  

Together, cluster 8_2 represents a cis-regulatory module set that coordinates regional identity of the mid-brain/hindbrain and drives the first wave of neuronal differentiation and circuit assembly during 13-20 hpf zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 8_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 8_3 captures an early, trunk-oriented neural/mesodermal regulatory program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility peaks during the first 0–10 somites (≈10–14 hpf).  
   • It begins to decline by 15 somites and is markedly weaker by 20–30 somites (≈20–24 hpf).  
   → This is a “gastrula / early-segmentation” enhancer set.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest pseudobulk values)  
   • Midbrain–hindbrain boundary cells (18.2–17.7)  
   • Tail-bud / axial progenitors (18.6–17.5)  
   • Floor-plate / neural floor plate (17.3–16.5)  
   • Hindbrain & spinal-cord neural progenitors (16–17)  
   • Neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs) & early somites (~15–16)  
   Accessibility is broad but clearly centres on trunk/caudal neural tube and contiguous mesodermal progenitors; epithelium, muscle or endoderm show only moderate signals and late decline.

3. Likely biological processes  
   Enriched gene set and motif landscape point to:  
   • Anterior–posterior (A–P) patterning and Hox code deployment (dense Hox-A/B/C/D representation).  
   • Neural tube patterning / neurogenesis (Pax6/7, Lhx, Dlx, Irx, SoxB1/3, Otx/Gbx boundary factors).  
   • Axis elongation & segmentation (Ta/Brachyury, Tbx16, Cdx, FGF & Wnt responsive genes).  
   • Dorsal–ventral midline specification (FoxA/D, Nkx2.2/2.4, floor-plate genes).  
   Collectively, these peaks mark enhancers that drive early trunk neuro‐mesodermal fate decisions and establish regional neural identity while somites are forming.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene co-expression)  
   High-confidence regulators include:  
   • Fox family: FoxA/FoxD/FoxC/FoxG/K (broad caudal neural & floor-plate activity).  
   • SoxB (Sox2/3/19/21) and Sox10 – neural progenitor competence.  
   • Hox paralog groups 4–10 – imparting positional identity along the trunk.  
   • Pax6 / Pax7 and Irx3/5 – dorsal spinal cord & hindbrain patterning.  
   • Lhx, Nkx2.2/2.4, Msx/Dlx – ventral & dorsal patterning cues.  
   • Tcf/Lef and Cdx factors – conveying Wnt/Cdx inputs for posterior body elongation.  
   • E2F/FOXM1 signatures – consistent with the high proliferation rate of axial progenitors.

In summary, cluster 8_3 represents a set of early-acting enhancers that are maximally open in trunk axial progenitors, floor-plate and caudal neural tissues during gastrulation-to-early segmentation and are driven by a Fox/Sox/Hox-centred transcriptional network that coordinates axis elongation and neural tube patterning.
]

## Cluster 8_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 8_4 marks a neural midline / mid-hindbrain regulatory program that turns on during somitogenesis and keeps strengthening until early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already elevated at the start of segmentation (0 som) but rises monotonically through 10 → 30 som (≈14–24 hpf).  
   • The largest jump is seen after 10 som, and the absolute maximum is reached at 20–30 som stages.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest average accessibility)  
   1. Midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) neuro‐epithelium  
   2. Neural floor-plate / ventral neural tube  
   3. Hindbrain neuronal progenitors  
   4. Second-tier: neural tube in general, notochord and fast/heart muscle (likely reflecting shared midline enhancers)  

3. Underlying biological process  
   The accessible regions link to genes that control:  
   • AP patterning of the neural tube and isthmic organiser (en1/en2, pax2/5/8, gbx1/2, otx/uncx, lmx1, eve1, wnt/fgf ligands).  
   • Ventral midline specification (foxa2, nkx2.2/2.4, shh-response factors).  
   • Early neuronal differentiation / axon guidance and commissure formation (ephb1/2, robo2, slit1a, sema3c/3d/3e/6b, plxna1a, grid2, ryr2b).  
   • Extracellular matrix and basement-membrane assembly needed for neuro-epithelial bending (multiple collagens, loxl genes, mmp11b, tgfb3).  
   Overall, the cluster represents enhancers that coordinate formation of the midbrain-hindbrain organiser, floor-plate and adjacent ventral neuronal lineages.

4. Key transcription-factor inputs (motifs highly enriched in the cluster)  
   • Engrailed/EN1–2 and PAX2/5/8 – hallmarks of the MHB organiser  
   • FOXA/FOXF/FOXD family – ventral midline and floor-plate drivers  
   • LMX1A/B, NKX2.2 / NKX1.2 – dopaminergic & ventral neural-tube programs  
   • GBX1/2 and OTX/PITX factors – anterior–posterior boundary positioning  
   • SOX2/3/11 and E2F – neural progenitor maintenance & proliferation  
   • MSX-DLX-BARHL-LHX homeobox groups – neurogenic differentiation

Together, the data indicate that peak-cluster 8_4 comprises cis-regulatory elements that become progressively open as the zebrafish neural midline and midbrain-hindbrain boundary mature, directing transcriptional programs for organiser activity, floor-plate identity and early neuronal/axonal patterning.
]

## Cluster 8_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 8_5 captures a broad “migratory mesenchyme / cranial-neural-crest” regulatory module that switches on as embryos leave gastrulation and peaks during early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at 0–5-somite stages (10–12 hpf) but rises steadily, reaching a maximum at 20–30 somites (≈22–24 hpf).  
   • Late-somite enrichment is most striking in neural-crest–derived lineages (30 somites: neural-crest 40.6; pharyngeal-arches 32.1) and in second-wave mesodermal derivatives such as lateral-plate mesoderm and myocardium (heart 17.0).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Cranial / trunk neural crest  
   • Pharyngeal-arch mesenchyme  
   • Lateral-plate mesoderm & hemangioblast / vascular mesenchyme  
   • Emerging myocardium, fast muscle and endocrine pancreas show moderate but significant activity early, consistent with mesenchymal–to–epithelial transitions in these tissues.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Genes in the cluster are heavily biased toward extracellular-matrix assembly/remodelling (Col1/5/12/14, Fn1, Vcan, Fbn2, Mmp2/11, Loxl2/3), cell-adhesion and guidance (Itga8/β1, Robo1/2, Sema3/4/5/6, Cdh11, Pdgfrb, Cxcl12).  
   • Transcription-factor inventory (HOX, DLX, MSX, LHX, PRRX, PAX, SOX) matches patterning and migration of cranial neural-crest cells, pharyngeal-arch skeletogenesis, cardiac outflow-tract formation and vasculogenesis.  
   • Combined, the peaks likely mark enhancers driving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, long-range cell migration, ECM deposition and early chondrogenic / osteogenic programmes in head, heart and vessel precursors.

4. Key transcription factors predicted to drive the cluster  
   CORE PATTERNING / IDENTITY  
   – Sox9/10/8, Tfap2 family → neural-crest specification & EMT  
   – Pax3/7, Msx1/2, Dlx2/5/6, HoxA/B/C (especially Hoxa2, Hoxb1/3) → rostro-caudal & pharyngeal-arch patterning  
   – Prrx1a/b, FoxC/FoxD/FoxL2, Tbx1 → mesenchymal identity, arch & heart outflow-tract development  
   MIGRATION / ECM  
   – Runx2/3, Etv/Fli1 (ETS), Ebf, Sp8/9, Tead1 → matrix production, motility, early osteo-/chondrogenesis  
   – CTCF, Kdm2/PRC regulators → chromatin structuring during lineage diversification

Together, cluster 8_5 represents enhancer activity that coordinates the emergence and patterning of migratory neural-crest and mesenchymal populations that will build craniofacial cartilage, pharyngeal arches, great vessels and portions of the pancreas and heart.
]

## Cluster 9_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 9_0 marks a set of regulatory elements that switch on early during segmentation but reach a sharp, tissue-restricted maximum at the onset of optic-cup formation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Broad low-level accessibility from 5-somite (~11-12 hpf) onward.  
   • Pronounced spike at 15-somite (~17–18 hpf) – the stage when the optic vesicle invaginates to form the optic cup.  
   • Afterwards the signal falls back to the “baseline” seen in most neuro-ectodermal derivatives, with a secondary rise in haematopoietic/vascular endothelium by 30 somites (~24 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Optic-cup / retinal progenitors (15-somite: 62-fold above baseline).  
   • Neural-derived populations (differentiating spinal and brain neurons, floor-plate, hindbrain) show consistent medium enrichment.  
   • Late endothelial/haematopoietic vasculature (30-somite) shows a modest but reproducible increase (~3× over baseline).  

3. Likely biological programme  
   Gene set and ontology point to:  
   • Eye-field specification and early retinal neurogenesis – Pax6/Rx/Six/Otx driven network, photoreceptor Ca2+-transport genes (slc24a2, pde1c), cell-adhesion/axon-guidance (ctnna2, contactins, sema5/6, tenm2).  
   • Generic neuro-epithelial proliferation/differentiation (npas3, runx1t1, e2f targets, cdk7).  
   • Later re-deployment in vascular remodeling (fgf18a, fgfr1a, wnt9a, gata/etv/ets factors) – explaining the endothelial accessibility bump.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & mapping)  
   • Eye-field / retina: Pax6/2/8, Rx1/2, Six3/6/7, Otx2, Crx, Vsx1 – motifs highly enriched and many factors expressed in correlated RNA set.  
   • Pluripotent neuro-ectodermal/core: SoxB (Sox2/3/19), SoxC (Sox4/11), Fox (FoxK2, FoxD1/3) – provide pioneer activity.  
   • Cell-cycle amplification of retinal progenitors: E2F1/2/3/7/8 module and Kdm2/Cxxc1 CpG-binding complex.  
   • RFX and Onecut/Meis motifs – characteristic of photoreceptor / retinal ganglion precursors and endocrine pancreas but here biased toward the optic cup.  
   • Secondary endothelial module: ETS (Fli1/Etv2/Etv5), Gata (Gata2/3/6) motifs align with the late endothelial signal.

Taken together, peak-cluster 9_0 represents eye-field/retinal enhancer elements that turn on at optic-cup formation, operate broadly in neuro-epithelial lineages, and are later reused during vascular endothelial maturation.
]

## Cluster 9_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 9_1 captures a very specific, short-lived burst of chromatin accessibility that coincides with optic-cup formation and the onset of retinal neurogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low-to-moderate (≈1.5–2 AU) at 0–10 somites, skyrockets at 15 somites (87 AU), falls back to modest levels at 20 somites (3 AU) and is essentially off again by 30 somites.  
   • The spike therefore occurs around 16 hpf – precisely when the optic vesicle invaginates to form the optic cup and the first retinal progenitors become specified.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • The >50-fold signal jump is confined to the optic-cup pseudobulk (eye field/early retina).  
   • All other lineages – neural tube, somitic mesoderm, endoderm, etc. – remain at the basal level, indicating that 9_1 marks eye-field–specific regulatory elements.

3. Regulatory program implied  
   • Associated genes are heavily enriched for neuronal / synaptic terms (NPAS3, SEMA4F, SHANK3a, TENM2, NRG1, GRIA/GRID/GRIN family, NCAM1a, NOS1) and for axon-guidance / adhesion molecules (ROBO, SEMA, VCAM1a, FAT/FAT3, ABLIM, ADGR).  
   • Together with optical-cup timing this points to regulation of:  
     – Eye-field specification and optic-cup morphogenesis.  
     – Transition of retinal neuroepithelial cells into proliferating neural progenitors.  
     – Early programs of neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis that prepare future retinal ganglion and amacrine cells.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + developmental context)  
   • Eye-field / retina lineage TFs: Pax6 (a/b), Rx (rx1/2/3), Vsx1/2, Lhx2/9, Crx – classic drivers of retinal progenitor identity.  
   • Zic family (Zic1/2/3/5/6) and Irx1/3/7 motifs, matching early neuroectoderm and optic stalk regulators.  
   • SoxB1 factors (Sox2/3/19) – maintain retinal progenitor potency.  
   • Fox factors (FoxG1, FoxC1/FOXK) implicated in optic-fissure closure and forebrain–eye boundary.  
   • E2F/TEAD motifs suggest concomitant cell-cycle and Hippo/Yap-mediated growth control in rapidly dividing retinal progenitors.  

In summary, peak cluster 9_1 represents a transient, optic-cup–specific enhancer set that turns on sharply at ~16 hpf to drive the gene-regulatory network needed for retinal progenitor specification and early neuronal differentiation in the developing zebrafish eye.
]

## Cluster 9_2

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 9_2 marks a neuronal maturation module that switches on during mid-to-late somitogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at 0–5 somites, rises at 10 somites and peaks between 15 and 30 somites (≈18-24 hpf).  
   • The strongest signal is seen at 15 somites in posterior neural tube (neural_posterior_15 somites ≈ 58 a.u.) and at 30 somites in enteric neurons (≈ 11 a.u.), matching the period when neurons extend axons and form synapses.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility in neuro-ectoderm–derived lineages:  
   • Posterior neural tube / spinal cord (neural_posterior)  
   • Differentiating generic neurons and mature “neurons” clusters  
   • Enteric neurons (gut innervation)  
   • Floor-plate / neural floor-plate  
   Very low or absent in epidermis, mesodermal derivatives, germ cells etc., indicating a neural-restricted program.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
   Gene list is dominated by neuronal functional categories:  
   • Axonal cytoskeleton & trafficking – DST, ANK2/3, KIF1B/5A, NAVs, RAB3, SV2A, SYT1  
   • Ion channels & synaptic receptors – CACNA1/β/γ, KCN families, GRIA/GRIN/GRIK, P2RX4  
   • Adhesion & guidance – CDH12/13/18, CNTN3, CNTNAP2, LAMB2, TENM3, SEZ6, SEMA genes  
   • Transcriptional/neuron-specific regulators – RBFOX1, SATB1, MEF2D, FOXK2, PAX6, IRX genes  
   These point to control of axonogenesis, synaptogenesis, membrane excitability and posterior neural identity.

4. Key transcription factors (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
   • FOX family (FOXK2, FOXG1, FOXP1/2/4, FOXD3/F) – broad neural chromatin organisers  
   • SOX family (SOX2/5/11/14/19) – neural progenitor and differentiation factors  
   • PAX/IRX homeodomain factors (PAX6/7, IRX1/3/5/7) – patterning of spinal cord domains  
   • HOX / UNCX – posterior axial identity cues  
   • MEF2 (MEF2D/CB) – activity-dependent neuronal maturation  
   • TCF/LEF & NEUROD/ASCL/ATOH bHLH motifs – Wnt-responsive and neurogenic drivers  
   Collectively, these TFs likely cooperate to open the 9_2 regulatory regions and activate the neuron-specific, posteriorly patterned gene set during 15-30 somite stages.

Summary: Peak cluster 9_2 represents a neuron-specific enhancer cohort that becomes highly accessible during mid-somitogenesis, most prominently in posterior neural tube and enteric neurons, and orchestrates genes required for axon outgrowth, synaptic function and posterior neural identity under the control of FOX, SOX, PAX/IRX, HOX and MEF2 transcription factors.

## Cluster 9_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 9_3 corresponds to a late-segmentation neuronal module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is low at 0–5 somites (~10–12 hpf), rises steadily through 10–20 somites and reaches its maximum between 15 somites (~18 hpf) and 30 somites (~24 hpf).  
• The sharpest increase is seen between 15 and 30 somites, matching the onset of terminal neuronal differentiation and circuit assembly.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is found in:  
• Optic cup / retinal neuro-epithelium – optic_cup 15 somites shows an extreme peak (≈46-fold over baseline).  
• Enteric neural crest–derived neurons – enteric_neurons progressively rise, peaking (>14-fold) at 30 somites.  
• Differentiating CNS neurons (hindbrain, spinal cord) and neural-crest derivatives show intermediate enrichment, whereas mesoderm, endoderm and epidermis remain close to baseline.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
The 330-plus associated genes are heavily biased toward mature neuronal functions:  
• Synaptogenesis / vesicle release: RIMS2, SYT6/7, VSNL1, BSNB  
• Neuro-transmission & excitability: GABRB2, GRM7, RYR2, SCN8A, PIEZO2, CACNA1 family, HCN1  
• Axon guidance & adhesion: CNTN4/5, ROBO1, TENM2, SDK1, UNC5A/D, PCDH clusters  
• Sensory / retinal identity: ERBB4, CRX-like family (OTX/CRX motifs present), PAX6 targets, PDE1C, CIB2  
• Enteric/visceral neuron markers: PHOX2A/B targets, RET-associated effectors (GDNF-pathway genes), CAPN1, PIGG, NR5A1  
Overall, the cluster marks the transcriptional switch from proliferating neuro-epithelium to post-mitotic, synaptically-competent sensory and autonomic neurons.

4. Key transcription factors (motifs enriched & present in gene list)  
Retina / optic cup: PAX6, RX (rx1/3), CRX, OTX1/2, VSX1, RAX, ONECUT, RFX (cilia/photoreceptor).  
Neural-crest / enteric neurons: SOX10, PHOX2A/2B, LMX1B, ISL1/2, PBX/MEIS, DLX family.  
Pan-neuronal differentiation: SOX4/5/11, NEUROD/ATOH, POU3F (BRN) factors, CREB/ATF, MEF2.  
Activity-dependent & nuclear receptors: NR2F1/2 (COUP-TF), ROR, RXR/RAR, NR4A family – consistent with retinoic-acid and circadian/neuronal activity cues.

Taken together, peak-cluster 9_3 represents a chromatin programme that turns on during late segmentation to drive the terminal differentiation of sensory (retinal) and autonomic (enteric) neurons, orchestrated by PAX6/CRX-like, SOX-, PHOX2- and PBX/MEIS-centred transcription-factor networks.

## Cluster 9_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 9 _4 is a “neuronal / enteric-neuron maturation” module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Modest accessibility from the first somite stage (5–10 som) in many neuro-ectodermal populations.  
   • Progressive increase in neural-crest derivatives and generic differentiating-neurons.  
   • Abrupt surge at late segmentation (20–30 som / 22–24 hpf) – especially in enteric-neurons where accessibility reaches >12 (vs. ~5–6 elsewhere).  
   → The module becomes maximally active during the final day of your atlas, coinciding with terminal differentiation and initial synaptogenesis of the enteric nervous system.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Enteric-neurons ≫ all other cell types, peaking at 30 som.  
   • Second-tier enrichment in: differentiating-neurons (brain/spinal cord), neural-crest, hindbrain & midbrain-hindbrain boundary.  
   • Minimal in non-neural tissues (epidermis, tail-bud, endoderm after 30 som).

3. Inferred biological programme  
   Gene list is dominated by:  
   • Synaptic vesicle and neurotransmission genes – snap25b, stx1b, unc13ba, snapin, cacna2d1, ryr2, gria/grin/grik/glra receptors.  
   • Axon guidance / adhesion – nrg1/3, tenm2/4, slit3, nrxn1/3, cdh11/18, dock4/9, plxna2/3.  
   • Neurotransmitter signalling – drd2a, drd4b, grm8b, gna15, ppp1r9a.  
   • ENS-associated regulators – phox2a/b motifs, runx2b, gli3, sufu, ptch1 (hedgehog).  
   Together these point to late neuronal maturation, axon outgrowth, synapse assembly and functional wiring of peripheral/enteric neurons.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs enriched in the cluster)  
   • SOX10 / SOX9 / SOX5 – neural-crest specification and maintenance.  
   • PHOX2A / PHOX2B – hallmark determinants of enteric-neuron identity.  
   • PAX3/7 + DLX/HOX/PBX/MEIS combinations – anterior-posterior and branchial/visceral patterning of crest derivatives.  
   • MEF2 family & NFAT – activity-dependent neuronal differentiation / synaptic gene activation.  
   • KLF/EGR & RUNX factors – neurite growth and axonal regeneration modules.  
   • Supporting factors: IRX, LHX, GATA3, FOXC/F (visceral mesoderm cues).

Summary: cluster 9 _4 marks the chromatin programme that turns on as neural-crest cells commit to, and mature into, enteric neurons during late somitogenesis, driving axonogenesis and synaptic connectivity in the nascent enteric nervous system.

## Cluster 10_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 10_0 corresponds to the myogenic enhancer program that turns the paraxial mesoderm (PSM / forming somites) into differentiated trunk skeletal muscle.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already elevated at the 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf) in PSM/somites.  
   • It rises sharply at 5–20 somites (≈11-18 hpf) and stays maximal through 30 somites (24 hpf), matching the wave of myotome differentiation and growth.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Fast-muscle (> 12–18 a.u. across time), generic “muscle” pseudobulks and differentiated somites.  
   • Presomitic mesoderm and tail-bud show intermediate accessibility (4-7 a.u.), reflecting precursor states.  
   • Virtually all non-mesodermal lineages remain at baseline (~2 a.u.).

3. Implied biological processes / pathways  
   • Skeletal-muscle specification and differentiation (myf5/myod1 → myog → mylf/structural genes).  
   • Sarcomere assembly & contractility: actc1a, ttn, tnni2b, mybpc2b, sgcd, ryr1b, cacna1ab, atp2a1l.  
   • Excitation–contraction coupling and Ca²⁺ handling.  
   • Myotome ECM and attachment (fn1b, col5a2a, tnc).  
   • Metabolic maturation of fast fibres (sqlea, slc2a3a, etc.).

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
   Motif enrichment plus correlated TF expression point to the canonical myogenic cascade:  
   • Myogenic bHLH – Myf5, Myod1, Myog, Myf6 (E-box motifs, TF lists 41/42).  
   • Mef2 family (mef2ca/cb/ab/aa/d; motif group 10, list 113) – cooperates with MRFs to activate structural genes.  
   • SRF (srfa/b) and TEAD/VGLL2 (tead1/3, vgll2a) – act on muscle-specific cytoskeletal genes.  
   • Pax3/7 and Six1/4 – early somite/myotome selectors marking precursors (motif lists 7, 25).  
   • Tbx (tbx2/5/15/18/20) and Fox (foxf2/d3) families appear at lower levels, consistent with somitic patterning inputs.

Together, peak-cluster 10_0 comprises the enhancers that are switched on as somitic mesoderm commits to, and matures into, fast skeletal muscle fibres during the 10–24 hpf segmentation–myotome period.
]

## Cluster 10_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 10_1 captures the chromatin program of the emerging fast-skeletal muscle lineage.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Already accessible at 0-somite stage (~10 hpf) but rises sharply after the first somitic cycles.  
   • Fast-muscle pseudobulk values climb from 21.7 (0 s) → 27.5 (10 s) → 29.5 (20 s) and remain high at 30 s (~24 hpf).  
   • Muscle/somite clusters show a similar monotonic increase ➜ maximal activity during mid–late somitogenesis (14-24 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Fast-muscle > generic “muscle” > differentiated somite/myotome (>14 fold above genome-wide background).  
   • Low–moderate signal in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and virtually basal levels in neural, endodermal or ectodermal cell types.  
   ➜ The peaks mark myotome-restricted regulatory elements.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Associated genes encode classic sarcomeric and contractile components: acta1a, myh7ba, tnni2b, tnnt1, tpm3, ttn.1, desma, csrp3, myoz2b, fhod3, mybph(a/b) etc.  
   • Additional hits (ppargc1b, hif1ab, slc25a25a, mbd3, smyd1b) point to metabolic maturation and chromatin remodelling of maturing fibres.  
   ➜ Cluster 10_1 therefore represents the enhancer set driving fast-skeletal muscle differentiation, sarcomere assembly and the metabolic switch that accompanies myofibre maturation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene co-expression)  
   • MEF2 family (mef2ca/aa/ab/b/d) – top motif enrichment; drives late myogenic and sarcomeric genes.  
   • SRF (srf­a/b) – cooperates with MEF2 on muscle CArG boxes.  
   • Myogenic bHLHs – MyoD1, Myf5, Myf6, Myogenin; motifs present (E-box), genes highly expressed in the same cells.  
   • TCF21 / Tbx18 / Tbx4, TEAD1 and FOXO/FOXM1 motifs also enriched, consistent with tendon/muscle boundary and proliferation regulation.  

Taken together, peak-cluster 10_1 delineates a temporally increasing, muscle-specific enhancer repertoire activated by the MyoD–MEF2–SRF network that orchestrates fast-skeletal muscle formation during zebrafish somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 10_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 10_2 represents the myotome / fast-skeletal-muscle program that turns on as soon as paraxial mesoderm begins to segment and remains active while somitic muscle fibres mature.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already very high at the 0–5-somite stages (10–12 hpf) in presomitic mesoderm (PSM ≈ 10–14) and nascent somites (Somites ≈ 37–31).  
   • It stays elevated through 10 som (∼14 hpf) and gradually tapers in somites, but rises again in committed muscle pools (Muscle_30 som ≈ 42) up to 24 hpf.  
   → Peak activity spans segmentation → early organogenesis, matching the timetable of skeletal-muscle differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   1. Fast skeletal muscle     (~41 at 0 som; still 28–42 later)  
   2. Somites / generic muscle   (~37 → 22)  
   3. Presomitic mesoderm      (~10–14)  
   Accessibility is low in neural, endodermal, or heart lineages, confirming a paraxial-mesoderm / myotome focus.

3. Regulatory program inferred  
   • Skeletal-muscle lineage commitment and maturation (myoblast fusion, sarcomere assembly, fibre-type specification).  
   • Segmentation / myotome patterning (ripply1, wnt16, has2, collagens, adam12/ts3/6, ltbp1).  
   • Metabolic switch to oxidative fatty-acid utilisation during muscle maturation (acox3, cpt1cb, acad11, pygb).  
   • ECM remodelling and tendon/enthesis formation (adamts, col11/12, thbs4b).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs enriched & genes present)  
   • Myogenic bHLH factors — MyoD1, Myf5, Myog, Myf6 (MRF motifs in clusters 41/42).  
   • MEF2 family — mef2aa/ab/b/ca/cb/d motifs highly enriched (group 10) – cooperates with MRFs for myofibre gene activation.  
   • SRF / MRTF axis — SRF motifs (cluster 10) control actin–cytoskeleton genes during fibre maturation.  
   • NFATc1/2 motifs (groups 12 & 20) – calcium-responsive enhancer use in nascent fibres.  
   • Tbx/Tcf factors (Tbx15/18/20, Tcf7/Lef1 motifs) – segmentation–to-myotome transition.  
   • Runx2/3, FoxO/FoxK and E2F motifs contribute to ECM remodelling, metabolic rewiring and proliferative exit.

Taken together, cluster 10_2 marks enhancers that drive the early formation and subsequent differentiation of fast skeletal muscle fibres derived from zebrafish somites.
]

## Cluster 10_3

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 10_3 marks the fast-skeletal–muscle gene regulatory program that turns on as the paraxial mesoderm matures into differentiated myotome.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at the 0-somite stage but rises steadily with each developmental stage.  
   • It reaches its maximum between 15- and 30-somites (≈19–24 hpf), the window when myoblasts exit the cell cycle and assemble functional sarcomeres.  

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signals)  
   • Fast-muscle/myotome (>14–24 AU)  
   • Generic “muscle” and “somites” clusters (≈9–10 AU)  
   • Presomitic mesoderm shows moderate accessibility (≈7–8 AU); most non-mesodermal lineages remain near background.

3. Biological processes likely regulated  
   Enriched gene list points to every hallmark of fast-fiber differentiation:  
   • Contractile apparatus – acta1b, myl1, mylpfa, mybpc2b, myog, myog-induced collagens.  
   • Excitation–contraction coupling – cacna1s/a2d1, ryr1b, stac3, hrc, casq1b.  
   • Metabolism & Ca2+ handling – pgam2, cpt1cb, ppar-targets, has2.  
   • Structural/ECM remodelling – col11/18/19, fn1, tnc, mxra5b.  
   • Signalling modulators of the myotome – fgf11a/22, vegfc, rspo2.  
   Together these peaks correspond to chromatin regions that orchestrate sarcomere assembly, fiber-type specification (fast twitch) and maturation of the zebrafish trunk musculature.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
   • Core myogenic bHLH: MyoD1, Myf5, Myf6 and Myogenin (motifs in M00045/56/151/152 blocks; present in TF set rows 41–42).  
   • MEF2 family: mef2ca, mef2d, mef2cb/ab (row 10) – required for late muscle gene activation.  
   • SRF/TCF factors (MADS box, rows 40 & 64) – cooperate with MEF2 for cytoskeletal genes.  
   • TEAD / YAP-responsive factors (tead1/3; row 82) – link mechanical cues to myofiber growth.  
   • Six/Pbx/Meis homeobox cofactors (rows 17, 28, 30, 48, 70) – pattern the myotome and position epaxial vs. hypaxial domains.  
   • E2F repression (row 6/13) fades as cells exit the cycle, consistent with the temporal increase in accessibility.

In summary, cluster 10_3 comprises fast-muscle enhancers that open progressively from early somites to 24 hpf, are highly selective for the myotome/fast-fiber lineage, and are driven by the canonical MyoD–MEF2–SRF transcriptional module with support from Six/Pbx/Meis patterning factors.
]

## Cluster 10_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 10_4 is a classic “myogenic” module that turns on as somitic mesoderm differentiates into fast-twitch skeletal muscle.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises steadily through segmentation: already detectable at 0 som (10 hpf), doubles by 10 som, and reaches its maximum at 20-30 som (≈19-24 hpf).  
   • This profile matches the timing of myoblast fusion and sarcomere maturation rather than the earlier specification of paraxial mesoderm.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest → lower)  
   • Fast-muscle lineage – fast_muscle (0–30 som) shows the strongest signal (40 → 94 arbitrary units).  
   • Generic “muscle” and differentiated “somite” bins (myotome) are also high.  
   • Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP) display only modest accessibility, and virtually all non-mesodermal lineages remain at background levels.

3. Likely regulatory program / biology  
   Enriched genes fall into hallmark skeletal-muscle functions:  
   • Myogenic regulators & contractile machinery – myf5, myod1, myog, myom2a, tnnc2, tpm2, tnnt2c, ttn, ryr1b, casq1a, casq2, chrnb1, sgca/sgcd/sgcg.  
   • Sarcomere assembly & excitation–contraction coupling – actn3b, kcnq4, kcnma1a, itpr1b, casq1/2.  
   • Membrane fusion and myofiber growth – mymk, mdga1, musk.  
   • Extracellular matrix / myotendinous junction – lama2, col19a1, col27a1b, fbn2a.  
   Together these points indicate that cluster 10_4 controls the transition from myoblasts to fully contractile fast muscle fibres.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment, TF-gene presence and timing all point to the canonical myogenic cascade:  
   • Myogenic bHLH factors – Myf5, Myod1, Myog (motifs M00404/06/07, genes highly expressed).  
   • MEF2 family – mef2aa/ab/cb/d (motif set 10) cooperate with MyoD to activate late muscle genes.  
   • Serum-response factor (Srf/Srfa) – required for actin–cytoskeleton and sarcomeric gene activation.  
   • Tbx18 / Tbx15 / Tbx5 (present in gene list) provide additional myotome patterning input.  
   • Fox (FoxK1/2, FoxO) and NFAT motifs are also enriched, consistent with metabolic and calcium-responsive regulation during fibre maturation.

In summary, peak-cluster 10_4 represents the chromatin program that is opened in late somitogenesis specifically in the fast-skeletal-muscle lineage to drive structural, contractile and metabolic maturation of zebrafish myofibres, orchestrated by the classic MyoD–MEF2–SRF transcriptional network.
]

## Cluster 10_5

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 10_5 captures the chromatin program that turns on when paraxial mesoderm transitions into differentiated skeletal (fast-) muscle.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises modestly in presomitic mesoderm and early somites (0–10 somites; 10–14 hpf) and climbs steeply thereafter, peaking at 20–30 somites (≈ 22–24 hpf).  
   • This timing coincides with fast-muscle fiber differentiation and myofibril assembly.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Fast muscle (all stages, maximal at 30 s)  
   • Trunk/tail “muscle” bulk population  
   • Maturing somites and presomitic mesoderm (PSM)  
   • Minor but measurable signal in epidermis, reflecting surface-adjacent myotome cells.

3. Regulatory programme / biological processes  
   Gene set points to classic skeletal-muscle pathways:  
   • Sarcomere and contractile machinery – tpm2, xirp1, myo1cb, ak1, vgll2a  
   • Myoblast fusion / cytoskeleton – capn2b, palld, amotl2b, rho family GTP-ases  
   • ECM remodelling and myotome boundary formation – col7a1, adamts2/adamtsl3, lamc1, ripk4  
   • MEF2/VGLL2-TEAD-controlled metabolic and growth‐related genes (lats2, stat5a, ulk2)

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
   Motif enrichment and expressed TFs converge on the canonical myogenic module:  
   • Myogenic bHLH factors: Myod1, Myf5, Myog, Myf6 (motifs in rows 41 & 42)  
   • MEF2 family: Mef2d, Mef2aa/b/ca/cb (row 10 / 113) – cooperate with MyoD/Myf5 for late muscle genes  
   • SRF / SRF-like (M00056, M00070) – actin-cytoskeleton and immediate-early muscle genes  
   • TEAD1/3 (row 82) together with co-activator Vgll2a – drives fast-muscle programme  
   • STAT5a (present in gene list & motif set) – growth/hypertrophy signalling  
   • Supporting regulators: E2F (cell-cycle exit of myoblasts), FOXO/FOXM1 (myoblast proliferation vs differentiation balance).

In sum, peak cluster 10_5 marks enhancers/promoters that open during the somite-to-fast-muscle transition, under control of MyoD/Myf-MEF2-SRF/TEAD circuitry, to activate structural, metabolic and ECM genes required for functional skeletal muscle fibers.
]

## Cluster 10_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 10_6 corresponds to the paraxial-mesoderm / early skeletal-muscle program that is switched on during somitogenesis and remains high through early myofibre differentiation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already elevated at the 0-somite stage, rises further between 5-15 somites and reaches its maximum around 10 somites (≈14-15 hpf; e.g. Muscle_10 = 39.4; PSM_10 = 30.9).  
   • Accessibility stays high through 20–30 somites but does not increase further, indicating a programme that is initiated during segmentation and maintained during early muscle fibre maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest values)  
   • Paraxial mesoderm / presomitic mesoderm (PSM)  
   • Newly segmented somites  
   • Fast-muscle and bulk “muscle” pseudobulks  
   • Lower, but still above background, in neuromesodermal progenitors and notochord; very low in neural/endodermal lineages.  
   → The pattern matches the lineage trajectory NMP → PSM → somite → fast-skeletal muscle.

3. Regulatory/biological programme inferred  
   • Genes in the cluster encode classic sarcomeric/contractile proteins (acta1a, actc1a, tpm2, myh7ba, ttn), muscle-specific cytoskeleton (klhl31, utrophin), myoblast fusion (mymk), metabolic enzymes (cpt1cb, ppargc1a) and segmentation components (tbx16, tbx18, dlc).  
   • GO/process implication: segmentation clock activity, somite boundary formation, fast-twitch muscle differentiation, assembly of the contractile apparatus and metabolic maturation of skeletal muscle fibres.

4. Key enriched transcription-factor drivers  
   • Myogenic bHLH factors: myod1, myf5, myog, myf6 (motifs in TF-set 41/42).  
   • MEF2 family: mef2aa/ab/ca/cb/d (motif set 10 & 113) – crucial for terminal myocyte differentiation.  
   • Paraxial-mesoderm T-box factors: tbx16 (spadetail) and tbx18 – regulators of segment identity.  
   • Pax3/7 and E-proteins (tcf12/e2a) – upstream of myod activation.  
   • Additional support factors: Runx (runx1/2/3), Msc, Lef1/Tcf7 (Wnt-responsive), indicating integration of Wnt and Notch segmentation signals.

Taken together, peak-cluster 10_6 marks cis-regulatory elements that orchestrate the transition from presomitic mesoderm to actively differentiating fast skeletal muscle during the 10-24 hpf window.
]

## Cluster 10_7

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 10_7 – concise interpretation

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises sharply as development proceeds through somitogenesis.  
  – 0 somites (~10 hpf): moderate (fast-muscle ≈ 31, muscle ≈ 33).  
  – 10–20 somites (14-19 hpf): strong (fast-muscle 47–55; muscle 44–49).  
  – 30 somites (~24 hpf): maximal (fast-muscle ≈ 58; muscle ≈ 72).  
→ Cluster is most active from mid- to late-somitogenesis and into early organogenesis, coinciding with terminal differentiation of trunk musculature.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is restricted to the myogenic lineage:  
• Fast-skeletal muscle fibres ≫ generic “muscle” bulk ≫ forming somites / paraxial mesoderm (PSM).  
• Very low in neural, endodermal, pancreatic or ectodermal populations.  
→ Cluster marks the fast-type skeletal muscle programme.

3. Regulated biological programme  
Gene content is enriched for classic contractile and sarcomere components and myoblast-specific regulators:  
• Structural/contractile: actc1b, actn3a/b, myh7bb, myh9b, myl4, mylz3, tnnc, tnni1c, tnnt2c, tpm2, tpm3, ttn.2, desma, capn3b, utrn.  
• Myogenic regulators: myod1, myf5, myog, mef2aa/ab/b/c/d, srfa/b, teads; fusion & maturation factors (mymk, trim54/63, musk).  
• Metabolic/Ca2+ handling: atp2b4, atp2c1, cacna1/2, ryr1b, slc8a4a.  
GO / pathway inference: skeletal-muscle cell fate commitment, sarcomere assembly, excitation–contraction coupling and metabolic maturation of fast fibres.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
Motif enrichment and co-expressed TFs indicate the canonical myogenic hierarchy.  
• Early myogenic determination: MyoD (myod1), Myf5, Myf6.  
• Differentiation enhancers: MEF2 family (mef2a/b/c/d) – strongest motif Z-scores in cluster (rows 10 & 113).  
• Sarcomere expression boosters: SRF (srfa/b) and TEAD1/3 (Hippo-Yap link).  
• Fibre-type modulators: NFAT family (nfatc1/2/3/4) and FoxO (foxo3/4) motifs present, supporting activity-dependent fast-muscle genes.  
• Up-stream progenitor factors (Pax3/7, Six/Eya) appear but with lower scores, matching earlier somite accessibility.

Collectively, peak cluster 10_7 demarcates enhancers/promoters that turn on during somitogenesis in paraxial mesoderm, reach maximal openness in fast-skeletal myofibres by 24 hpf, and are orchestrated primarily by the MyoD–MEF2–SRF/TEAD transcriptional cassette to drive assembly and functional maturation of trunk fast-muscle tissue in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 10_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 10_8 corresponds to a “neuromuscular differentiation module” that turns on while the trunk is being built and remains active as skeletal muscle fibres and their innervating neurons mature.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at the 0-somite stage (PSM ≈ 9 A.U.) but climbs sharply after somitogenesis begins.  
   • It rises between 10- and 15-somite stages and plateaus/high-points between 20- and 30-somites (≈ 19–24 hpf):  
     – Fast-muscle: 18 → 34 → 37  
     – Somites (bulk muscle): 14 → 34 → 41  
     – Differentiating / enteric neurons: 15 → 27–30.  
   Thus the cluster is most active from mid- to late somitogenesis through early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Skeletal-muscle lineage: presomitic mesoderm → somites → fast muscle / general muscle  
   • Peripheral & spinal neurons: differentiating neurons, enteric neurons, motor-column/spinal cord neurons  
   • Moderate signal persists in notochord/PSM early, fading later.  
   Together this pattern marks tissues that ultimately interact at the neuromuscular junction.

3. Regulatory programme encoded  
   Gene set is enriched for:  
   • Muscle structural and contractile genes – actc1c, tpma, myhz2, chrnb1, mylk4a  
   • Axon-guidance / synaptogenesis genes – LRRTM4, TENM2, NXPH2, NTNG1/2, RIMBP2, SHANK2, SV2B, SYT7, GABBR1, TACR1  
   • Excitability / Ca2+ handling – CACNA2D1, CACNA1H, KCN/KCND/KCNG/KCNH/KCNJ family, GRM/GRIK/GRID glutamate receptors  
   • ECM & adhesion molecules (COL4A2, EXT1/EXTL3, CNTNAP5, CADM3).  
   Functional annotation points to myofibril assembly, motor-neuron pathfinding, formation/maturation of the neuromuscular junction and early activity-dependent signalling.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
   • Myocyte enhancer factor family – MEF2A/B/C/D (muscle fibre differentiation)  
   • Serum-response factor (SRF) / MADS box – cooperates with MEF2 in sarcomere and actin gene activation  
   • NFAT family – Ca²⁺/calcineurin-dependent transcription linking electrical activity to gene expression in both muscle and neurons  
   • PAX3/PAX7, HOX & LHX/ISL “patterning” TFs – specify axial muscle blocks and motor-neuron columns  
   • FOX & SOX family members – early mesodermal/neuronal competence factors; FOXP/FOXA/FOXF, SOX5/6/9/21 motifs are common  
   • Nuclear receptors (RXR, ROR, NR2F/COUP-TF) – later metabolic/maturation regulators of muscle and neurons.

In summary, peak-cluster 10_8 demarcates chromatin regions that become accessible as paraxial mesoderm turns into contractile skeletal muscle and as peripheral / spinal neurons extend axons and establish functional neuromuscular synapses.

## Cluster 10_9

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 10_9 captures the canonical “presomitic-mesoderm → somitic muscle” transcriptional programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessible already at the 0-somite stage (PSM_0 ≈ 29) and rises sharply during segmentation, peaking between 10–20 somites (PSM_10/15/20 ≈ 34–39; fast-muscle_15/20 ≈ 20–22).  
• Accessibility plateaus or begins to decline after ≈24 hpf (30-somite), indicating this module is most active from early to mid-segmentation (~10–20 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signals are confined to paraxial‐mesoderm derivatives:  
• Presomitic mesoderm (all time-points)  
• Newly formed somites and generic “muscle” pseudobulks  
• Fast-skeletal-muscle lineage (fast-muscle_10–30 somites)  
Other lineages show only background-level accessibility.

3. Regulatory/biological programme  
Associated genes are enriched for:  
• Myogenic determination factors and structural muscle genes – myod1, myf5, myo15ab, actc1a, ttn, cap2, bin1b, flncb, fn1b, spon2a.  
• Segmentation/antero-posterior patterning genes – mespab, antxr2a, numerous Hox/HOX-like motifs.  
• ECM-remodelling and sarcomere assembly components (adamts10, ltbp1, col4a2, fbln2).  
Taken together, the peaks mark enhancers driving commitment of presomitic mesoderm to dermomyotome/myotome and subsequent differentiation of fast skeletal muscle.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif & gene presence)  
• Myogenic bHLH factors: MYOD1, MYF5 (strong MyoD/E-box motif enrichment; their genes present in the cluster).  
• MEF2 family (mef2aa/ab/b/ca/cb/d motifs highly enriched) – activates structural muscle genes downstream of MyoD.  
• TEAD/TCF12/LEF1 & TBX16/TBX6-like inputs – integrate Wnt/Tbx signals that initiate paraxial identity.  
• HOX/MESP-related motifs – patterning of individual somites.  
• Minor contributors: E2F/FOXM1 (cell-cycle exit of myoblasts) and SRF (sarcomeric actin genes).

Summary  
Cluster 10_9 represents a temporally restricted, paraxial-mesoderm–specific enhancer set that turns on during early somitogenesis, peaks while somites are being produced, and orchestrates the MyoD/MEF2-centred gene network that commits cells to and differentiates them along the fast skeletal-muscle lineage.

## Cluster 10_10

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 10_10 = “myogenic / sarcomere build-up” module  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility already detectable at 10 hpf (0-somite) but rises steeply through somitogenesis; it roughly doubles by 10–15 somites and peaks at 20–30 somites (≈ 19–24 hpf).  
• This timing matches the switch from presomitic-mesoderm specification to overt differentiation and maturation of skeletal and cardiac muscle.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest → moderate)  
• Fast skeletal muscle (fast_muscle 0–30 somites: 25 → 50)  
• General muscle cluster & differentiating somites (muscle, somites)  
• Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and early NMPs show moderate signal (10–15) – consistent with the onset of the myogenic program.  
• Heart myocardium shows intermediate accessibility (to ~19) – reflecting shared sarcomeric gene use.  
• Most ectodermal / endodermal lineages remain at background (≈ 5–7).

3. Implied regulatory program / biology  
Gene set is dominated by structural and contractile muscle genes (ttn, myh7ba/b, mylk5, desma, fhod3a/b, xirp1/2, tln1, obsl1a), ECM/adhesion genes needed for myofibre attachment (itga8, col4a1, vinculin, comp), and signalling components of myogenesis (pdgfra, smad1, tcf15, musk).  
→ Together they point to assembly of sarcomeres, costameres and myotendinous junctions as paraxial mesoderm differentiates into fast muscle fibres and heart muscle.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
Motif and gene enrichments converge on the canonical myogenic cascade:  
• Myogenic bHLH factors: Myod1, Myf5, Myog, Myf6 (motifs in rows 41/42).  
• MEF2 family: Mef2ca/cb/d/aa/ab (row 10) – activate structural sarcomere genes.  
• SRF/Serum-response (row 10, “srfa/srfb”) – cooperate with MEF2 on actin genes.  
• Tcf21 and bHLH partners (row 41/42) – early somitic muscle programme.  
• E2F/foxm1 cell-cycle motifs (rows 6, 59) – reflect proliferative myoblast stage before terminal differentiation.  
• Minor support from TBX (tbx15/18/20) and NR (Nr4a/Err/Rxr) motifs, typical of cardiac & slow-fast fibre diversification.

In summary, peak-cluster 10_10 marks chromatin regions that open progressively during somitogenesis in paraxial mesoderm, peak in fast skeletal (and secondarily cardiac) muscle, are enriched for myogenic bHLH/MEF2/SRF motifs, and regulate genes required for sarcomere assembly and mature muscle contractility.

## Cluster 11_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 11_0 corresponds to a large set of regulatory elements that gradually open during the segmentation stages and reach maximum accessibility at early organogenesis.  A brief synopsis:

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at 0–5 somites, rises at 10 somites, and climbs further at 15–20 somites.  
   • The peak is at 30 somites (≈ 24 hpf); the highest single signal in the matrix (13.2) is in Neural-posterior 30 somites.  
   → The cluster is therefore a “late-segmentation / early-organogenesis” module.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility (≥ 7 logCPM) is seen in:  
   • Posterior neural tube / spinal cord (Neural-posterior, Spinal-cord, Differentiating-neurons)  
   • Neuro-optic/optic-cup and hindbrain derivatives  
   • Endocrine pancreas & general endoderm  
   • Heart myocardium and somites (fast muscle)  
   • Moderate but broad signal in mesodermal and ectodermal derivatives; negligible in epidermis-30 somites (consistent with tissue-specific rather than ubiquitous promoters).  
   → The regions act in multiple, but particularly neuro-ectodermal and mesenchymal, lineages.

3. Likely biological programme  
   Associated genes are heavily enriched for:  
   • Extracellular-matrix & adhesion (Fn1b, Itga5/6, Col5a2, Lum, Adamts, Fat4, Vcanb)  
   • Axon guidance / synapse assembly (Tenm2, Slit2, Sema4F, PlxnA2, Unc13b, Ryr2, Gabbr/Gabrb2)  
   • Receptor signalling driving morphogenesis (Egfra, Met, Igf1r, Angpt1)  
   • Cytoskeletal & migration regulators (Rho/Rap GTPase GAPs/GEFs, Arhgap32b, Daam1a, Myl, Fhl, Ripor1).  
   GO terms (not shown) cluster around “axonogenesis”, “cell-migration”, “tissue morphogenesis” and “vasculature development”.  
   → Peak-cluster 11_0 marks an ECM/adhesion/axon-outgrowth programme that is switched on as cells begin long-range migration and neurite extension during organ formation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs enriched)  
   • AP-1 / bZIP family (Fos/Jun, Batf, Atf3) – canonical regulators of ECM remodelling and neurite growth.  
   • RUNX (Runx1/2/3) – mesenchymal/osteogenic & neural crest migration genes.  
   • SOX & FOX family (Sox4/11/21, Foxd3/FoxA/FoxP) – neuro-ectoderm and mesenchyme specification.  
   • bHLH neurogenic factors (Neurod1/2/4, Ascl1, Atoh1/7, Olig2) – neuronal differentiation.  
   • TEAD/​YAP (Tead1/3) – mechanotransduction, tissue growth.  
   • RFX, MEF2 and KLF/Sp motifs appear as secondary enrichments, consistent with ciliogenesis, muscle co-regulation and general promoter activity respectively.

In summary, peak-cluster 11_0 is a late-acting, broadly shared regulatory module that drives an extracellular-matrix/adhesion and neuro-morphogenesis gene set, with strongest activation in the posterior neural tube and other developing neuro-mesenchymal tissues at 20–30 somites.  AP-1, RUNX, SOX/FOX, neuro-bHLH and TEAD factors likely cooperate to open these regions and coordinate cell migration, axon outgrowth and organ assembly during early zebrafish organogenesis.

## Cluster 11_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 11_1 captures a late-neuronal/enteric-neuron maturation programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises steadily through somitogenesis and peaks at 30-somites (≈ 24 hpf).  
   • Example (enteric-neurons): 0 som = 8.9  → 10 som = 14.7  → 15 som = 16.6  → 20 som = 18.7  → 30 som = 41.5 (highest value in the entire matrix).  
   ➜ The cis-regulatory set is most active from mid- to late-somite stages, coinciding with terminal neuronal differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is confined to:  
   • Enteric-neurons ≫ all other cell types.  
   • Moderate signal in “differentiating_neurons” (generic CNS/PNS precursors) at ≥15 somites.  
   • Very low in non-neuronal tissues.  
   ➜ Cluster 11_1 is essentially an enteric-neuron-restricted set that turns on as these neural-crest derivatives exit the cell cycle and start wiring.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
   Correlated/overlapping genes encode:  
   – Axon guidance & synapse formation (ERBB4, CNTN1a, NRXN1a, NRXN3b, TENM2, UNC5a, PLXNA1a).  
   – Synaptic transmission / excitability (CACNA1ab, CACNA2D1, RYR2b, HCN4, GABBR2, GABRB4, GRID2, GRM1a, TRPC4, SLC8A2/4).  
   – Neuronal identity & survival (NPAS3, ONECUT1, LDB2, GATA-associated factors).  
   – Neural cytoskeleton / polarity (STMN2b, ROCK2b, ABI3, CYTH1b, VAV2).  
   ➜ Together they define late differentiation, neurite outgrowth and functional maturation of peripheral (enteric) neurons.

4. Likely key transcription factors (motif enrichment & biological context)  
   • Phox2a/Phox2b classic drivers of enteric-neuron identity; their motifs are highly enriched.  
   • Sox family (Sox10, Sox11/12/14/21) maintain neural-crest competence and promote neuronal differentiation.  
   • Lhx/Lmx & Uncx factors limb-homeobox proteins linked to visceral motor neuron programmes.  
   • Gata3 supports cholinergic/enteric neuron differentiation.  
   • Runx1/3 and MEF2 family motifs are also enriched, consistent with late neuronal wiring and activity-dependent gene activation.  
   • Nuclear-receptor (NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR, RXR/RAR) motifs suggest retinoid and circadian/ROR signalling inputs during maturation.

Summary: Cluster 11_1 marks enhancer/promoter regions that switch on in neural-crest-derived enteric neurons during 14-24 hpf, driving terminal differentiation, axon extension and synaptic competence under the control of Phox2, Sox, Lhx/Gata and NR2F/ROR transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 11_2

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 11_2 captures a posterior-mesoderm / somitogenesis programme that turns on midway through segmentation and remains active until early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already above background in gastrulation-stage NMPs (0-5 somites) but rises sharply during mid-somitogenesis (≈15–20 somites, 18-21 hpf) and declines again by 30 somites.  
• Highest values are seen at 15–20-somite time-points in all posterior mesoderm derivatives (tail-bud, PSM, forming somites) and in the contemporaneous surge of heart-myocardial progenitors.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Tail-bud cells (> 220 arbitrary units)  
• Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) & newly formed somites  
• Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs)  
• Early paraxial/fast muscle and differentiating skeletal-muscle clusters  
• Nascent heart myocardium (peak at 20 somites)  
⇒ The cluster marks the continuum from axial progenitors through PSM → somite → muscle/heart lineages.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Enriched genes and motifs point to classic posterior-mesoderm functions:  
• Axis elongation / segmentation clock: msgn1, tbxt, cdx4, ripply-like, notch2 etc.  
• Somite epithelialisation & myotome initiation: pax3/7, meox1, mef2a/c, myf5, myod, myog.  
• Cardiac lateral-plate contribution: tbx18, tcf21, isl1.  
• Posterior identity & RA signalling: long-cluster HOX (b5-10, c9/c10), RAR/RXR, Cdx.  
• High representation of cell-cycle/E2F genes reflects rapid progenitor proliferation in tail-bud/PSM.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs with strong enrichment & matching expressed TFs)  
• T-box: Tbxt (Brachyury), Tbx6/Tbx18 – drive posterior mesoderm and PSM identity.  
• Msgn1 – core oscillator of the zebrafish segmentation clock.  
• Hox class I (Hoxb4-10, Hoxc8–12, Hoxd9/10) – posterior axial patterning.  
• Forkhead: Foxf1/2, Foxd1/3/5 – mesoderm patterning and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.  
• Pax3/Pax7 – dermomyotome specification.  
• Mef2 (Mef2a/c/d) – early myogenic differentiation.  
• RA nuclear receptors (Rara/Rarg, Rxr, Nr2f/Coup-TF) – integrate retinoic-acid gradients with Hox code.  
• E2F/TFDP pair – underpin the proliferative state of tail-bud progenitors.

Taken together, peak cluster 11_2 delineates cis-regulatory elements that coordinate posterior body elongation, somitic segmentation and the earliest steps of muscle and heart differentiation during 10–24 hpf zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 11_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 11_3 marks an early, cranial-neural-crest / pharyngeal-arch programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at the 0-somite stage, reaches a sharp maximum at 10 somites (≈14-15 hpf), drops >60 % by 20 somites (≈18 hpf) and is essentially off by 30 somites (24 hpf).  
   → It is therefore an early–mid somitogenesis module that precedes overt organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest chromatin opening is seen in:  
   • Pharyngeal-arches (0 s: 17.0; 10 s: 17.5) – cranial-neural-crest-derived mesenchyme.  
   • Presomitic mesoderm at late stage (PSM 30 s: 9.3) – probably reflecting migrating crest/mesodermal mixing in the first arch.  
   • All other lineages remain at baseline (~3).  
   Thus the cluster is strongly enriched in pharyngeal-arch / cranial neural-crest cells, with minor activity in adjacent mesoderm.

3. Biological programme inferred  
   Gene set and motif content point to:  
   • Patterning of craniofacial (branchial) structures – Hox‐ and Dlx-controlled axial identity of the first–third arches.  
   • Neural-crest EMT, migration and early chondrogenic commitment (Sox9/10, FoxD3, TFAP2, Postna, Fstb, Frem2, Piezos).  
   • ECM-remodelling and axon guidance/neurite extension (Tenm2/3, Rims2, Piezo2, Sort1, Susd1).  
   Collectively, peaks likely correspond to enhancers controlling early arch segmentation and specification.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
   • Hox–Pbx–Meis axis (many anterior Hox motifs; Pbx/Meis cofactor motifs): sets arch-specific axial identity (e.g. Hoxa2-positive second arch).  
   • Dlx (dlx1/2/4/5/6 motifs): required for first-arch skeletogenic crest differentiation.  
   • SoxE group (Sox9/10) and Sox4/11: neural-crest multipotency and chondrogenic competence.  
   • TFAP2 (Ap-2) and Pax3/7: crest induction/migration.  
   • Fox (FoxD3/Foxc1/Foxl1) motifs: crest survival and mesenchymal transition.  
   • Minor contribution from Runx and Mef2 motifs, fitting onset of chondrogenic and myogenic programmes in the arches/PSM later on.

In summary, peak-cluster 11_3 represents an enhancer set that becomes transiently accessible in cranial-neural-crest cells as they populate the pharyngeal arches, driven by a Hox/Dlx/Sox/Fox/TFAP2 transcriptional network that establishes craniofacial axial identity and initiates skeletogenic differentiation.
]

## Cluster 11_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 11_4 represents a “trunk / somitic mesoderm” programme that switches on as the embryo enters active segmentation and early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises gradually from the 5-somite stage and reaches its maximum at 20–30 somites (≈ 18-24 hpf).  
   • Earlier (0 som) and very late (>30 som) stages show ~15-20 % lower signal.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Somites (all bins, especially 20- & 30-somites: 60–63 AU).  
   • Fast/total muscle and paraxial mesoderm (PSM, tail-bud).  
   • Moderate signal in lateral-plate mesoderm & endocrine pancreas – tissues that receive the same RA/HOX input during this window.  
   • Neural and endodermal populations display only basal (~40-45 AU) accessibility.

3. Underlying regulatory/biological processes  
   • Trunk patterning by HOX code and retinoic-acid signalling.  
   • Somitogenesis and myogenic commitment (myotome formation, sarcomere & calcium-handling genes e.g. atp2a1, tnnc2, mef2 targets).  
   • RA-controlled endodermal derivatives (pancreatic buds) share part of the programme.  
   • Cell-cycle/E2F motifs point to proliferative, still-expanding somitic precursors.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (enriched motifs & linked genes)  
   • HOX / PBX / MEIS TALE complex – positional identity along A–P axis.  
   • RAR/RXR & COUP-TF (NR2F) family, ESRR/PPAR – retinoid-responsive nuclear receptors that open these regions.  
   • Pax3/7 & IRX – early myogenic and dermomyotome regulators.  
   • Myogenic cascade: MyoD/Myf5 → MEF2A/B/C/D motifs mark differentiation onset.  
   • Wnt/β-catenin effectors (TCF/LEF) and TBX/T (Ta) motifs consistent with ongoing segmentation-clock input.  
   • Auxiliary FOX and SOX motifs (foxd3, foxf2, sox6/9) likely cooperate in mesoderm vs. neural boundary elements.

Together, peak-cluster 11_4 delineates the cis-regulatory landscape that enables retinoic-acid/HOX-dependent patterning and the transition of paraxial mesoderm into patterned somites and differentiating skeletal muscle between 10 and 24 hpf.
]

## Cluster 11_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 11_5 represents the “paraxial-mesoderm / fast-muscle” regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at the onset of segmentation (0–5-somite stages) but rises steadily through the somitogenesis series, reaching its maximum at 20- to 30-somites (≈ 22–24 hpf).  
   • This temporal profile matches the timing of myotome differentiation when fast-myofibres mature and begin robust sarcomeric gene transcription.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest average accessibility)  
   • Fast-muscle lineage: fast_muscle (20 → 38), generic muscle (21 → 67), somites.  
   • Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) shows intermediate-high signal, consistent with the earlier progenitor state.  
   • Very low in endoderm, neural, vascular and other lineages, indicating strong muscle bias.

3. Implied regulatory programme  
   • Associated genes include classic myogenic structural / contractile and maturation genes (myog, myot, tpm2, aacs, plekhg2, sgms1) and signalling modulators of paraxial mesoderm (bmpr1ba, chrd, fstb, gli1/2).  
   • Gene ontology points to:  
     – Skeletal muscle cell differentiation and fusion  
     – Sarcomere organization & actin–myosin filament assembly  
     – Somitogenesis and patterning of trunk paraxial mesoderm  
     – Modulation of BMP/Hedgehog cues that position the myotome.

4. Key transcription factors inferred from motif enrichment & TF lists  
   • Myogenic bHLH factors: Myod1, Myf5, Myf6, Myog – provide lineage commitment and activation of muscle structural genes.  
   • MEF2 family (Mef2a/b/c/d) – cooperate with Myod/Myog for late differentiation and sarcomere gene activation.  
   • SRF (Serum-response factor) – reinforces actin-cytoskeleton and contractile gene expression.  
   • TEAD/TA (Tead1/3; Tbx family) and FOXO/Klf co-motifs appear, but at lower scores, suggesting supportive roles in growth and metabolic maturation.  

Taken together, peak-cluster 11_5 marks enhancers/promoters that switch on as presomitic mesoderm commits to fast skeletal-muscle and drive the transcriptional programme that builds functional myofibres in the zebrafish trunk during late somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 11_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 11_6 marks a broad endodermal/epithelial programme that switches on during somitogenesis and remains high as the first gut-derived organs mature.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already appreciable at 0–5-somite stage but rises steeply during mid-somitogenesis (10–20 somites ≈ 15–20 hpf).  
   • Endoderm signal keeps climbing and reaches its maximum at 30 somites (≈ 24 hpf; endoderm_30 = 53.5, the highest value in the matrix), while transient tissues such as hatching-gland and somites peak earlier (10–15 somites) and then decline.  
   → Overall, the cluster is most active from mid- to late-somitogenesis, coinciding with gut‐tube morphogenesis and early organ (pancreas, liver, intestine) differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest average accessibility)  
   1. Endoderm (gut-tube epithelium)  
   2. Endocrine-pancreas precursors/β-cell lineage  
   3. Hatching-gland (secretory epithelial cells)  
   4. Somites / forming fast muscle (brief high accessibility around 10–15 somites)  
   Moderate signal is also seen in optic cup and other epithelial derivatives, but neural/mesodermal populations show only baseline levels.

3. Regulatory/biological programme inferred  
   • Associated genes are rich in epithelial transporters and metabolic regulators (atp1a1a, cldn10b, ca9, slc34a2b, acsl1a, hk2, hspg2), pancreatic/gut TFs (hnf1bb, glis3, foxp1a), secretory pathway components (gng12, rab3ab, ret, pdgfc) and RA/Notch/Fgf signalling components (rarga, notch1a, fgfr1a).  
   • GO themes therefore point to:  
     – Specification and regional patterning of fore-/mid-gut endoderm  
     – Initiation of pancreatic endocrine differentiation and metabolic maturation  
     – Retinoic-acid-dependent epithelial morphogenesis  
     – Early activation of muscle–attachment/ECM genes in the somitic spike.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif & gene co-enrichment)  
   • Nuclear-receptor module: RAR/RXR (rarga/b, rxraa/b), HNF4a/g, NR2F (COUP-TF), PPAR α/γ, ROR family – classic regulators of RA and lipid-metabolic programmes in gut & pancreas.  
   • Forkhead pioneers: FoxA1/2/3, FoxP1/2/4, FoxL1/FoxF, FoxC – open chromatin and establish endodermal enhancer landscape.  
   • SOX network: Sox17/18/3/9/21 supporting endoderm identity and epithelial maturation.  
   • HNF1b, GLIS3, Onecut factors – pancreas/intestine specific transcription.  
   • HOX / PBX / MEIS inputs – rostro-caudal patterning of the gut tube.  
   • Limited E-box/BHLH (NeuroD/Neurog/Atoh) activity mirrors endocrine-pancreas and hatching-gland secretory differentiation.

In summary, peak-cluster 11_6 represents enhancers/promoters that become accessible as zebrafish definitive endoderm transitions into functional gut and pancreatic epithelium, under the control of RA-responsive nuclear receptors, Forkhead pioneers and classic endoderm/pancreatic TFs.

## Cluster 11_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 11_7 captures a late-acting, epidermis-centric regulatory program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises monotonically from 0-somite (~10 hpf) to 30-somite (~24 hpf) stages in virtually every lineage.  
   • The signal is modest at gastrulation (values ≈ 6-8), doubles during segmentation (10-15 somites), and peaks at 30-somites – most conspicuously in epidermis (104.1; >10-fold above early time-points).  
   → The cluster is therefore most active during early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest chromatin signal)  
   1. Epidermis / periderm – by far the strongest at all stages, especially 15-30 somites.  
   2. Other ectoderm-derived tissues with appreciable signal: differentiating neurons, neural crest, optic cup.  
   3. Moderate enrichment in mesodermal derivatives that require an epithelial sheath (fast muscle, somites, heart, endodermal buds).  
   → The pattern points to a program shared by surface ectoderm and epithelia that envelop internal organs.

3. Likely biological roles  
   • Epidermal/periderm maturation and barrier formation – supported by very high epidermal accessibility and ECM-related genes (col12a1a, agrn, adamts18, emilin1b, adamts-like, cnn3a).  
   • Extracellular-matrix remodelling & basement-membrane assembly – collagen-, agrin-, and metalloprotease-encoding genes.  
   • Cell-adhesion / planar-polarity & axon-guidance processes needed for skin–neural interactions (pcdh15a, robo3, ntng1a, tenm3, nrg1).  
   • Retinoid / lipid and circadian-metabolic signalling (osbpl8, rcan3, ppar-, ror-, nr1d-series receptors) consistent with epidermal metabolic switching during differentiation.

4. Enriched transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and presence of the cognate TF mRNAs in the same cells highlight four cooperating TF classes:  
   • Nuclear-receptor cluster: RAR/RXR (rarga/b, rxrα/β), ROR (rora/b/c), REV-ERB (nr1d1/2), COUP-TF (nr2f1/2/6) and PPAR (ppara/pparg).  These regulate retinoic-acid and lipid programmes that drive epidermal differentiation and barrier lipid production.  
   • MITF/TFE family (tfec, tfe3, mitfa/b) – important for pigment-cell and epidermal lineage maturation; tfec is in the associated gene list.  
   • Grainyhead / p63 / GRHL axis (grhl1/2, tp63 motifs present) – master regulators of periderm formation and epithelial tight-junction genes.  
   • AP-1 / bZIP stress-response factors (JUN, FOS, ATF3, BATF) – cooperate with nuclear receptors during late epidermal morphogenesis and wound/stress pathways.

In sum, cluster 11_7 marks enhancers that switch on during early organogenesis, are maximally open in surface ectoderm, and coordinate nuclear-receptor- and MITF/GRHL-driven programmes that build and remodel the embryonic zebrafish skin and other emerging epithelial structures.

## Cluster 11_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 11_8 marks a regulatory program that turns on during the transition from late segmentation to early organogenesis and is concentrated in the neuro‐epithelial territory at the mid-brain / hind-brain interface.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Low–moderate accessibility at 0–10-somite stages  
   • Abrupt rise at 15 somites (≈16 hpf) and maximal accessibility at 20–30 somites (≈19–24 hpf) – the window when the midbrain–hindbrain boundary (MHB) becomes morphologically and transcriptionally mature.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • midbrain_hindbrain_boundary 15/20/30 somites (peak values 2.85 → 3.57)  
   • optic_cup 5 somites (early neural plate border)  
   • hindbrain & differentiating_neurons (secondary peak, ~2.0)  
   • minor but consistent signal in hematopoietic_vasculature and endoderm, probably reflecting shared Fox/Hox enhancers.

3. Implied biological processes  
   • Patterning and maintenance of the MHB organiser (antero-posterior neural patterning, FGF/Wnt signalling interface)  
   • Early neuronal differentiation, axon-guidance and synapse assembly – supported by associated genes ERBB4, NRXN2a, GRIN2ca, SORCS3, SEMAs, EPHa3, CNTN4, CHRNB2, etc.  
   • Enrichment of long-range axon-motility / extracellular-matrix genes (ADAMTS2, BMP1b, COL-processing factors) suggests concurrent shaping of the isthmic constriction.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched in this cluster)  
   • Pax family – Pax2a/5/8 and Pax6; classical determinants of the MHB and optic cup.  
   • Gbx / Engrailed / Lmx1 & Barhl – homeobox factors that cooperate with Pax genes to set MHB identity.  
   • Sox2/3/19b & Fox (Foxg1, Foxd1/3, Foxa/c) – maintain neuro-epithelial competence and organiser signalling.  
   • Hox (hoxa/b/c/d groups) – reflect caudal hind-brain segments immediately posterior to the MHB.  
   • E2F & Mef2 motifs appear but at lower levels, consistent with ongoing cell-cycle exit followed by neuronal maturation.

Taken together, cluster 11_8 demarcates enhancers that are switched on as the midbrain–hindbrain organiser matures, driving region-specific neuronal differentiation and early circuit assembly under the control of Pax-Gbx/Engrailed-Fox/Sox TF modules.
]

## Cluster 11_9

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 11_9 represents a late-acting myogenic/mesenchymal enhancer set.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest and fairly uniform until mid-somite stages, then rises sharply after ≈20-somites and shows a dramatic spike at the 30-somite (≈24 hpf) sample – the ‘muscle_30somites’ pseudobulk jumps ~10-fold compared with earlier stages.  
   • The trajectory (e.g. endoderm 11 → 21, pancreas 11 → 16, heart 10 → 23) indicates a gradual, late-embryonic activation wave that culminates during early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility:  
   • Generic skeletal muscle population (‘muscle_30somites’ >80 a.u.).  
   • Supporting but lower signals in fast-muscle, somite core, heart-myocardium, enteric-neurons and endoderm‐derived mesenchyme.  
   Interpretation: the peaks are most active in differentiating trunk/axial myofibres, with broader use in other mesoderm-derived, collagen-rich tissues.

3. Regulatory programme encoded by the peaks  
   Gene set enrichment points to:  
   • Skeletal-muscle contractile apparatus and Z-disc assembly – klhl31, pdlim5/7, sgcd, myo15b.  
   • Extracellular-matrix and myotendinous-junction components – col11a1a/18a1a/19a1, col5a2a, tnc, tnn, tenm2/3, flrt2.  
   • Cell-migration/axon-guidance and neuromuscular wiring – cxcr4a, unc5d, rims2, ntrk2b, grid2.  
   • Metabolic and RA/PPAR-driven maturation – klf15, raraa, pparda.  

   Collectively, the cluster marks the transition from early myoblasts to fully contractile, ECM-embedded myofibres and the parallel maturation of other mesenchymal derivatives.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment highlights two cooperating TF groups:  
   • Core myogenic circuit – MyoD/Myf5/Myf6, Myogenin, MEF2 (mef2a/b/c/d) and SRF; these factors drive sarcomeric-gene and cytoskeletal programmes.  
   • Nuclear-receptor / Hippo modulators – RAR/RXR (rarga, raraa, rxrα/β), PPAR (ppara/pparg), COUP-TFs (nr2f1/2/6) and TEAD1/3; they tune metabolic, ECM and growth‐switch genes during late fibre maturation.  
   Additional support comes from RUNX, KLF (klf9/15) and TCF/LEF motifs that are known co-factors in myofibre and tendon development.

In summary, peak-cluster 11_9 defines a retinoid-responsive, MEF2/MRF-controlled enhancer programme that is switched on at the end of somitogenesis to orchestrate myofibre assembly, muscle-ECM integration and late mesodermal tissue maturation.
]

## Cluster 11_10

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 11_10 marks a late, retinoic-acid–responsive enhancer program that switches on as the heart begins to beat.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is moderate at all earlier stages (10–20 hpf) but explodes at the 30-somite stage (≈ 24 hpf): heart_myocardium_30 somites = 50.3 (10-fold above the bulk background).  
   • The sharp increase only at 30 somites indicates activation during early organogenesis, after initial heart tube formation but coincident with chamber growth and first contractions.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest signals at 30 somites are seen in:  
   • Heart myocardium ≫ all other tissues (50.3).  
   • Secondary but much lower enrichment in optic cup (9.2), posterior neural tube and endoderm (7–8).  
   The profile therefore points to cardiac muscle–specific enhancers with minor activity in RA-sensitive ocular and neural tissues.

3. Regulatory program inferred  
   a. Gene set: tie1, fgf12a, kcnk2a, hdac4, meid2a, tead3a, gli3, pax6a etc. – genes involved in:  
      • Cardiomyocyte maturation / electrical conduction (fgf12, kcnk2, hdac4, mef2 targets).  
      • Vascular/endocardial signalling (tie1).  
      • Retinoic-acid patterning of heart and eye (pax6a, gli3).  
   b. Motifs: overwhelming enrichment for nuclear-receptor half-sites (RAR/RXR/COUP-TF, ROR, PPAR), MEF2, TEAD/Yap and E2F.  
      • RAR/RXR/COUP-TF cluster ⇒ classical RA-response elements; RA signalling is essential for zebrafish heart inflow/outflow tract patterning and retina differentiation.  
      • MEF2 & TEAD motifs ⇒ cardiomyocyte contractile-gene activation and Hippo-controlled growth.  
      • E2F motifs alongside declining bulk accessibility in proliferative progenitors suggests cell-cycle exit coupling.

   Put together, the peaks likely regulate RA-driven transcription that coordinates cardiomyocyte cell-cycle withdrawal, sarcomere assembly and early contractility, with a parallel role in RA-patterned eye field.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   • Nuclear receptors: Rarga/b, Raraa/b, Rxraa/b, NR2F1/2/6 (COUP-TFs), RORα/β/γ, PPARα/β/γ – provide RA / lipid-derived signalling input.  
   • MEF2 family (mef2aa/ab/b/c/d) – core cardiac muscle activators.  
   • TEAD3/TEAD1 – Hippo-pathway effectors that partner with YAP/TAZ during chamber growth.  
   • E2F1-4/7 – regulate the final cell-cycle rounds and withdrawal in differentiating cardiomyocytes.  
   • Supporting factors: FOX family (FoxC/A), BACH/BATF (antioxidant stress), KDM2 (chromatin remodeling).

In summary, cluster 11_10 represents a burst of RA- and MEF2/TEAD-controlled enhancers that become highly accessible in cardiomyocytes at 24 hpf, driving the transcriptional shift from proliferative lateral-plate precursors to beating heart muscle and, to a lesser extent, RA-patterned ocular/neural tissues.

## Cluster 11_11

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 11_11 – concise biological read-out

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises as soon as gastrulation ends (0–5 somites) and peaks through mid- to late-somitogenesis (10–30 somites).  
   • Highest signal is at 15–20 somites and remains strong at 30 somites, then falls once organ primordia are formed.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Very strong:  
   • Tail-bud progenitors (all stages, max at 15–30 s; tail_bud_30 s ≈ 8–112 AU)  
   • Somitic mesoderm / nascent muscle (somites, fast-muscle)  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP) early, then decline  
   Moderate: presomitic mesoderm, posterior spinal cord / neural crest  
   Low background in non-mesodermal tissues.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   The combination of posterior (HOX), retinoid/nuclear-receptor and mesoderm-segmentation cues points to enhancers that drive:  
   • Posterior axis elongation and segment formation (somitogenesis)  
   • Transition of NMP → paraxial mesoderm → skeletal/fast muscle lineages  
   • Retinoic-acid-dependent patterning of trunk/tail tissues (RA sets the anterior–posterior boundary of somites and pancreas buds – consistent with the late accessibility seen in endocrine-pancreas pseudobulks).  
   Associated genes (rttn, rttn, cadm1b, cdh22, sema3fa, myrf, tfap2c, mfsd13a etc.) support roles in cell-adhesion/migration, axon-guidance and early myogenesis that accompany trunk morphogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment groups 11, 26, 31, 32 etc.)  
   • RA / nuclear-receptor module: RARA/B/G, RXR (α/β), NR2F1/2 (COUP-TFs), NR4A, ROR, HNF4, PPAR – signature of RA-responsive enhancers in somitic/tail tissues.  
   • Posterior patterning & segmentation: multiple HOX (A/B/C/D 1-13), MESP-/TBX-family, PAX3/7, UNCX, LHX, MSX.  
   • NMP & early mesoderm TFs: SOX2/3/19b, SOX5/6, FOXA/F/O, E2F/FOXM1 (proliferative tail-bud cells).  
   Together these factors explain the strong accessibility in tail-bud and somite compartments and implicate RA-modulated HOX circuits in driving axial extension and muscle precursor specification.

One-sentence summary  
Cluster 11_11 marks RA-responsive, HOX-rich enhancers that switch on during mid-somitogenesis in tail-bud/NMP descendants and remain most open in forming somites and nascent fast muscle, orchestrated by RAR/RXR, COUP-TF, HOX, SOX and FOX factors to control posterior axis elongation and early myogenic differentiation.
]

## Cluster 11_12

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 11_12 is a late-acting, posterior–axis regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest from 0-15 somites, rises at 20 somites and peaks at 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • The two highest signals are in NMPs_30 somites (≈60-fold above baseline) and Tail-bud_30 somites (≈80-fold).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Posterior growth-zone populations – Tail-bud cells and Neuro-Mesodermal Progenitors (NMPs).  
   • Paraxial mesoderm derivatives (posterior PSM, late somites).  
   • Posterior neural tube / spinal cord and dorsal neural progenitors.  
   • Secondary enrichment in heart myocardium and hemangioblasts, consistent with mesodermal contribution of NMPs.  
   • Very low in epidermis, endoderm, anterior brain regions or early gastrula cells.

3. Inferred regulatory programme  
   Genes linked to the cluster (Wnt16, Wnt7bb, Ptk7a, Sall4, Sox32, Zfpm2a, Cdh4/Cdh7, Epha3, Tenm4, Sema3ab, Crb3a, Shroom3, Msi2a, Gdnfa, Hspg2, Col21a1, etc.) point to:  
   • Posterior body-axis elongation and segmentation (Wnt/PCP signalling, cell-polarity and adhesion genes).  
   • Activation of trunk/tail HOX code and retinoic-acid response.  
   • Maintenance of multipotent progenitor state (Sall4, Msi2a) alongside high proliferative activity.  
   • Early neuro-muscular patterning (axon-guidance, Ca-channel, synaptic genes).  
   Thus the cluster appears to coordinate the gene set required for continued tail extension, late somitogenesis and initial patterning of posterior spinal cord and associated mesoderm.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & mapping)  
   • Posterior HOX paralogs (Hoxb5/6/7/8/9, Hoxc8/9/10/11/13, Hoxd9-13) plus PBX/MEIS/PKNOX co-factors – impose trunk/tail axial identity.  
   • RAR/RXR and COUP-TF (NR2F) nuclear receptors – integrate retinoic-acid and posterior RA gradient.  
   • SOX family (Sox2/3/19/21, Sox10) – maintain neural progenitor competence.  
   • FOX & NKX1.2 factors – characteristic of NMPs and posterior neural tube.  
   • PAX3/7 and IRX/PBX motifs – mesodermal and neural crest contributions.  
   • E2F/FOXM1 – proliferation signature of rapidly dividing tail-bud progenitors.

Taken together, peak-cluster 11_12 marks the chromatin programme that turns on in late somitogenesis to drive posterior body elongation, tail-bud/NMP maintenance and the earliest differentiation of posterior neural-mesodermal derivatives.
]

## Cluster 11_13

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 11_13 marks a very “early-embryo / posterior-progenitor” chromatin program.  
Below is a compact read-out of what the data say.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at the 0-somite stage and reaches its maximum between 5-10 somites (≈12-14 hpf).  
• A gradual decrease is seen after 15 somites and the signal is clearly lower by 30 somites (≈22-24 hpf).  
→ The cluster is therefore most active during the window when the embryo is elongating and newly formed axial tissues are still highly proliferative.

2. Cell-type specificity (relative enrichment)  
Highest‐scoring pseudobulks  
• Tail-bud (all time points, strongest at 0–10 somites)  
• Optic cup / eye field (10–20 somites)  
• Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) and posterior spinal cord / neural-posterior pools  
• Early paraxial mesoderm (PSM 0–10 somites)  
Low-to-moderate signal in well-differentiated tissues such as mature somites, fast muscle and endoderm.  
→ The peaks preferentially open in highly proliferative posterior axial progenitors and the nascent eye field, two territories that share a stem-like, pattern-setting transcriptional state.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Correlated/overlapping genes and motif content point to four coherent biological themes:  
a) Posterior body extension & axial patterning – Hox (multiple paralog groups), Cdx1/4, Wnt5b, Rarb/a, FGF-responding motifs.  
b) Multipotent progenitor maintenance & proliferation – Nanog, Lin28a/b, Yap1/Vgll4, E2F targets, cell-cycle genes.  
c) Convergence/extension & PCP signalling – Wnt5b, Rho/Rac modulators (Rac1b, Arhgap family), Zeb1b (EMT).  
d) Early neuro-retinal specification – Pax6, Rx1/2/3, Six3/6, Otx/Crx, Barhl & Vsx motifs; optic-cup pseudobulks carry the same peaks.

Altogether this cluster appears to regulate chromatin at enhancers that keep posterior axial/neuromesodermal progenitors (and the contemporaneous eye field) in a highly proliferative, patternable state while they receive Hox/Cdx positional cues.

4. Key transcription factors likely driving the module  
(derived from top motif Z-scores and gene co-expression)  
• Posterior patterning: Cdx1/4, HoxB/D paralogs, Rara/b, Cdx-responsive cofactors.  
• Stem-like / proliferative state: Sox2/3/19b, Tead-Yap (Yap1, Vgll4), E2F1-3-7, FoxM1.  
• PCP / EMT: Zeb1b, Tcf/Lef (Wnt), Tbx16/T (tail bud).  
• Eye‐field branch: Pax6a/b, Rx2/3, Six3/6, Otx2/Crx, Barhl1.  
These TFs collectively explain both the temporal (early) and spatial (tail-bud + optic cup) accessibility profile of peak cluster 11_13.
]

## Cluster 11_14

[*assistant*:
Peak Cluster 11_14 – concise interpretation

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises modestly during early somitogenesis (0–20 somites) but shows a sharp, ~4-fold surge at 30 somites (~24 hpf).  
• The temporal profile therefore marks the late (early-organogenesis) window when neural-crest derivatives finish migrating and start terminal differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is confined to neural-crest–derived lineages:  
• Enteric neurons (especially 30 somites; log-signal ≈ 25 – the strongest of all pseudobulks)  
• Neural-crest progenitors & differentiating neurons (moderate signal)  
• Minor accessibility in hindbrain / vagal-crest neighbours; low in mesoderm & endoderm.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
The 120 ± associated genes are enriched for functions needed when enteric neurons settle in the gut and mature:  
• Neuronal differentiation & subtype identity – neurod6a, dab1a, runx2a, cntnap5a  
• Axon guidance / growth-cone signalling – plxnb2a, unc5a, sema6ba, rhogb  
• Synaptic vesicle release & ion conductance – stx1b, doc2b, unc13ba, cacna1g/1ha, hcn2b, kcnc2, grin1b, grid1a  
• Cell-adhesion & myelin-related genes – nlgn2b, nrxn3b, pllp  
Overall, the cluster appears to control the late migration, wiring and functional maturation of enteric (and some cranial) neurons.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (from motif enrichment & mapping)  
Motifs with the highest z-scores in this cluster map to TF families that are textbook regulators of enteric neurogenesis:  
• PHOX2 (phox2a / phox2ba / phox2bb) – master regulator of enteric neuronal fate  
• SOX10 → SOX4/11/21 switch – crest maintenance then neuronal differentiation  
• DLX & HOX paralogues – rostro-caudal patterning of vagal crest stream  
• RUNX1/3 – subtype specification & axon targeting  
• GATA2/3 and HAND/TBX factors – differentiation of autonomic neurons  
• COUP-TF / RAR / RXR nuclear receptors – retinoic-acid signalling that times vagal-crest exit and entry into the gut  
• RFX & NFAT – ciliogenesis / calcium-dependent maturation steps  
Together these factors constitute the known gene-regulatory network that converts migrating vagal‐crest cells into functional enteric neurons at ~1 dpf.

In summary, Peak Cluster 11_14 demarcates the late (24 hpf) wave of chromatin opening that equips vagal neural-crest cells to complete migration, adopt enteric-neuronal identity and initiate synaptogenesis, driven by a PHOX2/SOX–DLX/HOX–RUNX–GATA/COUP-TF transcription-factor ensemble.
]

## Cluster 11_15

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 11_15 represents a broad, late-somitogenesis “organiser/vasculature” module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises steadily from the 0- to 15-somite stages and peaks at ≈20 somites (≃19-22 hpf); high levels are maintained through 30 somites.  
   • The cluster is therefore most active during the transition from late segmentation to early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) cells – the strongest signal (up to ~26.1).  
   • Hematopoietic vasculature / hemangioblasts (23–25).  
   • Heart myocardium and endothelial/vascular derivatives.  
   • Secondary but still elevated in endocrine pancreas, endoderm and differentiating neurons.  
   The pattern points to an organiser region (MHB) and closely associated neuro-vascular mesodermal derivatives.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Patterning of the MHB organiser: pax2a/8, fgf8a, egr2b (krox20), engrailed, otx, lmx1, wnt/rar signalling genes are all in the associated-gene list.  
   • Specification and maturation of haemato-vascular progenitors: tal1, gata2/3, etv2, runx1/2/3, fli1, erg, kdrl (vegfr) etc.  
   • Early cardiac tube and endodermal organ primordia (aldh4a1, jag1b/notch, gata4/6).  
   • GO terms therefore converge on FGF- and RA-driven A-P neural patterning plus vasculogenesis / angioblast migration.

4. Key transcription factors enriched (motifs & gene list)  
   • MHB / neural patterning: PAX2/5/8, EN1/2, OTX1/2, EGR2, LMX1, GBX, KROX.  
   • Forkhead & SOX families (FOXA/B/C, FOXG1, SOX2/3/19) – organiser competence and neural progenitor maintenance.  
   • HOX & MEIS/PBX cofactors – A-P axial identity.  
   • Vascular / blood: ETS factors (ETV2, FLI1, ERG), GATA2/3, TAL1, RUNX1/2/3.  
   • Nuclear receptors (RARα/β/γ, RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF) – consistent with strong RA-signalling input at the MHB.  
   Together these TFs describe an RA/FGF-modulated organiser that simultaneously seeds adjacent neuro‐epithelial and haemato-vascular programmes.

In summary, peak-cluster 11_15 marks chromatin regions that open late in segmentation, most prominently in the midbrain-hindbrain organiser and emerging vascular progenitors, orchestrated by PAX/ENGRAILED/FOXA-SOX regulatory logic combined with RA-responsive nuclear receptors and canonical haemato-vascular ETS–GATA–TAL1 modules.
]

## Cluster 12_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 12_0 captures a mesoderm/axial‐tissue accessibility program that turns on during early somitogenesis and largely shuts down once organ primordia start to mature.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already elevated at the 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf), rises further and reaches its maximum between 10 – 20 somites (≈14 – 19 hpf), and then drops sharply by 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • The pattern is therefore tightly linked to the window of trunk elongation and active somite formation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signal)  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs)  
   • Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and forming somites  
   • Early paraxial/axial derivatives – fast-muscle precursors, general “muscle” pseudobulks and notochord cells  
   (Most neural, endodermal or late-stage mesodermal populations show only background levels.)

3. Likely biological processes regulated  
   • Segmentation clock and periodic somite budding (tbxt, tbx, mesp/clock genes, many Hox genes)  
   • Specification and early differentiation of trunk skeletal muscle fibres (myod1 / myf5, mef2, myog targets)  
   • Notochord maturation (tbxt, loxl1, col11a1, nid2, cftr, etc.)  
   • ECM remodelling and adhesion needed for convergent-extension and somite boundary formation (col5a2, adamts3, cadherins, alcama, JAM3, etc.)  

   In short, the cluster marks regulatory elements used while paraxial/axial mesoderm is being patterned and while the first myogenic and notochordal differentiation programs are launched.

4. Key transcription-factor motifs enriched (drivers)  
   • T-box family (TBXT/Brachyury, TBX6/16) – axial elongation & paraxial fate  
   • Myogenic bHLH factors (MYOD, MYF5, MYOG, TCF21) – skeletal-muscle initiation  
   • MEF2 family – consolidation of myotome gene expression  
   • Hox class motifs – anterior-posterior identity of emerging somites  
   • FoxC/FoxF/FOXO motifs – mesodermal cell-migration and boundary formation  
   • Sox (Sox5/6/9) – extracellular-matrix and chondrogenic aspects of notochord/sclerotome  
   Accessory enrichments for E2F and E-box factors likely reflect the high proliferation rate of PSM/NMP populations during this period.

Taken together, peak-cluster 12_0 represents the core cis-regulatory landscape that drives segmentation, trunk elongation and the earliest wave of myogenic/notochord differentiation in zebrafish embryos.
]

## Cluster 12_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 12_1 marks a very late (≈ 24 hpf, 30-somite) transcriptional burst that is spatially restricted to posterior tissues.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is flat (log2 ≈ 2) from 0- to 20-somites and then jumps sharply at 30-somites:  
     – presomitic mesoderm 30 s = 26.8 (≈ ×10 above baseline)  
     – enteric-neurons 30 s = 15.5  
     Slight increases (log2 ≈ 3) are seen in other trunk neuron samples, but the spike is essentially a 30-somite event.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest signal:  
     – Presomitic / newly formed posterior somites (PSM-30 s)  
     – Vagal-neural-crest–derived enteric neurons (enteric-neurons-30 s)  
   • Moderate signal: differentiating spinal-cord / trunk neurons.  
   • Minimal in anterior neural, endodermal or cardiac lineages.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   The associated gene set is dominated by:  
   • Posterior Hox genes (hoxa9-13, hoxb4-10, hoxc8-13, hoxd9-13) and their TALE cofactors (pbx, meis, pknox) – specifying caudal axial identity.  
   • Neural-crest / autonomic-neuron factors (phox2a/b, dlx, barx, uncx) plus a large cohort of axon-guidance, synaptic and ion-channel genes (cntn5, grid2, gria3, kcnq3, piezo2, npas3, syt7, unc13b, etc.) – consistent with rapid maturation of the enteric and trunk peripheral nervous system.  
   • ECM-remodelling and myogenic genes (adamts, fstl, col14a1, myh9b) – reflecting somite maturation and muscle-tendon formation.

   Together these features point to a late posterior patterning module that coordinates (i) termination of somitogenesis and (ii) differentiation/migration of vagal-crest cells into the gut.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif and gene overlap)  
   • Posterior HOX paralogs (HOXB7-13, HOXC8-13, HOXD9-13) – core positional code.  
   • TALE cofactors PBX1/3/4, MEIS1/2/3, PKNOX – required for HOX DNA binding specificity.  
   • FOX family (FOXC1/FOXF2, FOXD3/D5, FOXI1/3) – mesodermal segmentation and neural-crest competence.  
   • PHOX2A / PHOX2B and DLX/EVX/UNCX – autonomic and enteric neuron lineage determinants.  
   • E2F/MEIS-associated motifs suggest a switch from proliferation to differentiation, while NFAT/MEF2 motifs (moderately enriched) fit late-stage calcium-dependent maturation of muscle and neurons.

Summary: cluster 12_1 is a HOX-PBX-MEIS-centred enhancer set that switches on at the end of somitogenesis to impart posterior axial identity to the last somites and simultaneously drive differentiation of vagal neural-crest cells into the enteric nervous system.

## Cluster 12_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 12_2 = “neural-crest / peripheral-lineage module”

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises already at 0–5 somites (≈10–13 hpf), peaks around 10 somites (≈15 hpf) in premigratory/migratory neural-crest cells, and stays high through 15-30 somites (≈18–24 hpf) where it shifts to differentiated derivatives (highest value in enteric-neurons at 30 somites).  
   • Pattern therefore fits an early NCC-specification phase followed by a late derivative-maturation phase.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest pseudobulk scores)  
   • Neural-crest (all stages; 7.7–11.6 AU)  
   • Enteric-neurons (15–30 somites; up to 14.8 AU)  
   • Hemangioblast / hematopoietic vasculature (5–30 somites; 4–7 AU)  
   • Additional moderate enrichment in differentiating-neurons, hatching-gland, fast-muscle and endocrine-pancreas, all tissues that receive neural-crest input or share similar EMT/ECM programmes.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
   • Neural-crest identity & migration: sox10, foxd3, pax7b, erbB3/4, pdgfrb, ccbe1, adams-metalloproteases, eph/sema/plexin (sema5a, plxna3, epha6), cxcl/angpt genes.  
   • Lineage-specific differentiation  
        – Pigment lineage: mitfa, tyr, tspan2b, pmel‐related genes.  
        – Peripheral/enteric neurons & glia: unc5c, lrrtm4, egflam, grin2b, piezo2, ryr1a.  
        – Vascular/mesenchymal outputs: angpt2b/4, pdgfc, pdgfrb, vldlr, tgfbr2/3.  
   • ECM remodelling & axon/crest migration: collagens (col12a1b), fibulin (fbln7), thrombospondin (thbs2b), adamts16/17, scube3.  
   Altogether the peaks mark enhancers driving EMT, long-range migration and subsequent lineage diversification of neural-crest derivatives.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene list)  
   • Core NCC factors: SOX family (SOX10/9/8/5/11), FOX (FOXD3/K1/O, FOXI), PAX3/7, TFAP2 family.  
   • Lineage-bias TFs  
        – Pigment / MITF-TFE clade (MITFa/Tfec/Tfe3).  
        – ETS factors (Fli1/Etv/Elk) and RUNX for endothelial/hematopoietic branches.  
        – GATA2/3 and NFAT for autonomic/enteric neuronal differentiation.  
        – MEF2, bHLH (NeuroD/Neurog/ATOH) motifs reflecting neural maturation.  
   • Chromatin regulators: KDM2B/CXXC module suggests active enhancer priming in multipotent NCCs.

Summary: Cluster 12_2 comprises enhancers activated first in premigratory zebrafish neural-crest cells and re-used in multiple crest-derived lineages (enteric neurons, pigment cells, hemangioblasts). It encodes the transcriptional and signalling toolkit necessary for neural-crest EMT, migration, and peripheral organogenesis between 10- and 24-hpf.
]

## Cluster 12_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 12_3 represents a neural-differentiation module that switches on once neurogenesis starts and remains active through early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• First clear opening at the 5-somite stage (~11–12 hpf).  
• Accessibility increases steadily and reaches its maximum at the 30-somite stage (~24 hpf).  
  (Midbrain-hindbrain-boundary 5 som: 29.3; differentiating-neurons 30 som: 3.1; PSM 30 som: 15.5 – the latter reflects neuro-mesodermal derivatives that retain neural potential.)

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signal)  
• Midbrain–hindbrain boundary neuroepithelium (strong early spike).  
• Differentiating CNS neurons (hindbrain & optic regions).  
• Neuro-mesodermal progenitors / posterior PSM at late stages – cells that give rise to spinal cord neurons.  
Other cell types show only basal (~2) accessibility.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
Enriched genes encode:  
• Axon-guidance and synaptogenesis molecules – CNTN4/5, ROBO1, GRIN/GABR, RIMS2, TENM2, NTRK2/3, PIEZO2.  
• Cell-adhesion & ECM components required for neurite outgrowth – multiple collagens (COL14/15/27), CHST8, MFAP4, SORCS3.  
• Voltage-gated ion-channel subunits – KCNH2, KCNT1, CACNA1 family, SCN1/12, reinforcing a maturing neuronal identity.  
• Transcriptional/epigenetic regulators typical of neural lineage maturation – DISC1, DMXL2, REST-targets.  
Together these point to control of axon extension, guidance and early synaptic assembly in newly generated central and peripheral neurons.

4. Key transcription factors (motif enrichment & gene presence)  
Motifs with the only positive Z-scores and corroborated by RNA links highlight:  
• SOX family (SOX10 / SOX4/11) – neural-crest & neurogenic drivers.  
• PAX6 / PAX3/7 – patterning and neurogenesis in midbrain-hindbrain and spinal progenitors.  
• DLX / BARHL / LHX clusters – interneuron and hindbrain neuronal differentiation.  
• FOX (FOXG1, FOXD3, FOXP) – early neural competence and regional identity.  
• NFAT & CREB/ATF sites – activity-dependent maturation of young neurons.  
Thus the cluster is likely governed by a SOX–PAX–DLX/FOX transcriptional cassette, with NFAT-CREB acting downstream to fine-tune terminal neuronal features.

In summary, peak-cluster 12_3 demarcates regulatory DNA that becomes accessible as embryonic neurons leave the cell cycle, extend axons and start assembling synapses, most prominently in the midbrain–hindbrain boundary and later in spinal-cord-derivative neurons.
]

## Cluster 12_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 12_4 marks the cis-regulatory program that turns on when vagal / trunk neural-crest cells commit to, and then differentiate as, enteric and other peripheral neurons.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already modest at 0–10-somite stages (~10–14 hpf) but rises steadily thereafter.  
• A sharp jump occurs after 20 somites (~19 hpf) and peaks at 30 somites (24 hpf): e.g. enteric-neurons 0 → 30 som = 3.1 → 15.5; differentiating-neurons 0 → 30 som = 2.7 → 5.4.  
→ The cluster is therefore a late-gastrula to early-organogenesis (15–24 hpf) module, maximal during neuronal maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is seen in:  
• Enteric neurons 30 somites (>> any other cell type).  
• Differentiating spinal/cranial neurons, generic “neurons”, neural-crest derivatives.  
• Early neuromesodermal/PSM populations show only baseline access that is lost later, indicating initial priming but not maintenance.  
Low/absent in epidermis, muscle, endoderm, vasculature, etc.

3. Biological programme encoded  
Gene set is dominated by:  
• Neuro-developmental TFs and patterning genes (HOX-B/C, PAX3/7, DLX, LHX, BARHL, PHOX2, UNC-class).  
• Enteric-neuron markers and effectors - ret, phox2a/b, hand2, gfra2/4, unc13b, rims2, syt2, gabra/b subunits.  
• Synapse assembly / vesicle cycling genes (RIMS, SYT, UNC13, SNAP25, GRIA/K, GABR).  
• Axon-guidance / adhesion (NRXN, CNTN, ROBO, SEMA, PLXNA/B).  
Collectively this points to AP patterning of the neural tube/neural-crest followed by terminal differentiation of autonomic and sensory neurons, especially the enteric nervous system.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
• Sox family (Sox10, Sox5/9/21) – neural-crest identity & gliogenesis.  
• Fox factors (FoxD3, FoxG1/FOXK, FoxP) – neural-crest maintenance, neurogenesis.  
• Phox2a/Phox2b, Hand2 – core enteric-neuron specification with Ret.  
• HOX-B/C paralogs – rostro-caudal identity of vagal/trunk crest.  
• PAX3/7, DLX/BARHL/LHX – sensory and motor neuron subtype programs.  
• Ets factors (Etv4/5, Elf/Erf) – downstream of Ret/GDNF signalling.  
• GATA2/3 and MEF2/CREB family motifs also appear, consistent with later neuronal maturation and activity-dependent genes.

Summary  
Cluster 12_4 is a late developmental, neuron-specific accessibility program that is primed in early axial progenitors but becomes highly active in neural-crest-derived enteric neurons and other differentiating neurons, coordinating HOX/PAX/Sox/Fox/Phox-driven patterning with synaptogenic and neurotransmission gene activation.
]

## Cluster 12_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 12_5 captures a late-acting neuronal/enteric-neuron chromatin programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest and fairly uniform from 0- to 20-somite stages (~10-20 hpf; values ~1.3–2).  
   • A sharp surge appears at the 30-somite stage (~24 hpf), peaking in enteric neurons (15.5-fold higher than earlier time-points) and rising in most neuronal subsets and floor-plate, indicating that the cluster is maximally engaged during early organogenesis when neurons start terminal differentiation and synaptogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Enteric neurons ≫ all other cell types (huge spike at 30 somites).  
   • Differentiating neurons, generic “neurons”, floor-plate, hind-/midbrain and spinal cord show moderate enrichment.  
   • Mesodermal, epidermal, endodermal or muscle lineages remain low, underscoring neuronal specificity.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
   Gene list is packed with:  
   – Synaptic vesicle and neurotransmission genes (SNAP25a/b, SYT7, UNC13B, RIMS3/4, SV2A, SYNGAP1, GABRB3/4, GRIN/GRIK/GRIA subunits, CACNA1/2/γ, KCN* channels).  
   – Axon guidance / adhesion molecules (CNTN3/4/5, SDK1/2, TENM2/4, ROBO1, NCAMs, CDH4/13, L1-family).  
   – Autonomic/enteric-lineage markers (PHOX2A, GFRA4b, RAR-related, SOX10, RET-pathway partners).  
   – Neuronal transcriptional regulators (RBFOX1, NPAS3, BRSK2, MAPK10, STAT5a).  
   Functional enrichment therefore points to neuronal maturation, synaptogenesis and establishment of the enteric nervous system (ENS).

4. Key transcription factors (motif + gene evidence)  
   • SOX family (SOX10, SOX5/8/9/21/32): neural-crest and pan-neuronal pioneers; motifs highly enriched (multiple SOX-containing rows).  
   • PHOX2A / PHOX2B motifs (phox2a/ba/bb) – master regulators of autonomic & ENS neurons.  
   • HOX/PBX/MEIS cooperative motifs – rostro-caudal identity of vagal neural-crest cells that generate ENS.  
   • FOX family (FOXA/F/G/K, FOXP, FOXC) – pioneer factors opening neuronal enhancers.  
   • DLX, LHX, BARHL, NKX and IRX clusters – transcription factors that pattern specific neuronal sub-types and cranial/vagal neural-crest derivatives.  
   • E2F & KDM2B/CXXC hits likely reflect transient cell-cycle control as progenitors exit cycle prior to differentiation.

Overall interpretation  
Cluster 12_5 marks enhancers that become fully accessible as vagal neural-crest-derived cells differentiate into enteric neurons and more broadly as CNS/PNS neurons commence synaptogenesis around 24 hpf. The programme is driven by SOX-, PHOX2-, HOX/PBX-, FOX- and DLX/LHX-class TFs and coordinates expression of genes required for neuronal maturation, axon growth and functional innervation of the gut.

## Cluster 12_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 12_6 marks the “late-somite cardiac/muscle” programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low at gastrula/early-somite stages (≈2-3 log units).  
   • It rises steeply after ≈10 somites and peaks between 15-30 somites (≈18-24 hpf):  
     – heart myocardium: 8 → 18 (0 → 20 somites)  
     – fast/enteric muscle and differentiating neurons show a late spike (30 somites).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest values)  
   • Heart myocardium (all time points, maximal).  
   • Fast skeletal muscle (30 somites).  
   • Enteric neurons & differentiating neurons (late, lower amplitude).  
   • Minor accessibility in endocrine pancreas and general endoderm.

3. Regulatory/biological programme inferred  
   • Structural and contractile apparatus of striated muscle/cardiomyocytes  
     - sarcomere and thick-filament genes: ttn.2, myh7l, smyd1b, myrf.  
   • Extracellular-matrix/adhesion and outflow-tract morphogenesis  
     - svep1, agrn, spon1b, thbs3b, thsd7, slit3, unc5d.  
   • Electrical/neuronal interface components (consistent with emerging cardiac conduction and enteric innervation)  
     - npas3, grid1b, hcn1, scn3b, epha6.  

   Together these point to maturation of beating myocardium (sarcomere assembly, ECM remodelling, innervation) during heart-tube looping and early chamber formation.

4. Key transcription-factor motifs enriched  
   • Core cardiac/muscle drivers – MEF2 family (mef2a/b/c/d), SRF, MYOD/Myf5, TEAD/Yes-associated factors.  
   • Heart patterning factors – TBX5/20, NKX2-5/2-3/2-4, GATA4/5/6, IRX1/3/5.  
   • Supporting regulators – NR family (RXR/RAR/PPAR), E2F (proliferation switch-off), CTCF/YY1 (chromatin architecture).  

   These TF sets can collectively activate the contractile, ECM and guidance genes listed above.

In sum, peak-cluster 12_6 represents a chromatin module that opens predominantly in cardiomyocytes (with later deployment in skeletal muscle and enteric neurons) during mid-to-late somitogenesis to drive structural, functional and innervation-related maturation of the zebrafish heart.
]

## Cluster 12_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 12_7 marks enhancers that switch on when vagal-crest–derived neurons start to settle in the gut and differentiate into functional enteric neurons.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Low–moderate accessibility from 0- to 20-somite stages (10–22 hpf).  
   • Abrupt surge at 30-somites (≈24 hpf): enteric_neurons_30 = 15.5 (≈20-fold above baseline), while all other stages remain ≤ 1.4.  
   → The cluster is therefore activated late, coincident with terminal differentiation/axon outgrowth of the enteric nervous system.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest in enteric_neurons (all stages, extreme at 30-somites).  
   • Secondary but far weaker signal in generic differentiating_neurons and floor-plate cells; negligible in mesoderm/endoderm.  
   • This pattern points to a vagal neural-crest/enteric neuron-restricted regulatory module.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Associated genes are heavily enriched for:  
   – Axon guidance / adhesion: cntn4, cntnap2a, neto1, astn1, tnc, tenm2, podn.  
   – Neurotransmission & excitability: gabra3, grin2ab, grm4/7/8, scn1laa, piezo2, ryr2, kcnq2, ntrk3.  
   – Autonomic/visceral neuron markers: gfra2/4, prokr1b, npy1r, rorc, phox2 motif targets.  
   Together with the timing, this indicates these peaks control terminal differentiation, wiring and functional maturation of enteric ganglia.

4. Candidate transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and TF-mapping highlight the canonical enteric/visceral GRN:  
   • Phox2a/Phox2b (PHOX2 motifs) – master regulators of autonomic and enteric neuron fate.  
   • Sox10 / Sox21 / Sox5 – maintain neural-crest competence and promote neuronal differentiation.  
   • Fox family (FoxD3, FoxF2, FoxL1) – early crest and gut mesenchyme interaction factors.  
   • Gata2/3 – required for late enteric neuronal maturation.  
   • Hand2, Dlx, Pbx/Meis and Hox paralogs – patterning and noradrenergic differentiation support.  
   • Moderate E2F/MEF2 motifs likely reflect generic cell-cycle exit and neuronal maturation.

In summary, cluster 12_7 represents an enteric-neuron-specific enhancer set that is sharply activated during the 24 hpf transition to functional enteric ganglia, driven mainly by Phox2-, Sox-, Fox- and Gata-family transcription factors orchestrating axon guidance, synaptogenesis and visceral neuronal identity.
]

## Cluster 12_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 12_8 captures a neurogenic/neuronal chromatin programme that comes on late and is most pronounced in the nascent enteric nervous system.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at gastrulation/0-somites, rises sharply after the 5-somite stage and peaks at 20-30 somites (≈ 19–24 hpf).  
   • The monotonic increase (e.g. enteric-neurons: 3.1 → 15.9; differentiating-neurons: 1.5 → 7.9) indicates activation during early organogenesis, when neural crest-derived neurons leave the cell-cycle and start terminal differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Enteric neurons ≫ differentiating CNS/PNS neurons > generic “neurons” pools.  
   • Only baseline accessibility in mesoderm, endoderm, epidermis or muscle, underscoring neuronal restriction.

3. Predicted regulatory/biological programme  
   • Associated genes are enriched for:  
     – Axon guidance & synapse assembly (CNTNAP2a, TENM2, PCDH/DSCAM family, ROBO3, NRG2a, ERBB4).  
     – Ion-channel and excitability genes (KCNT1, CACNA1, KCNK2a, PIEZO2, GABBR, GRM, SCN1L).  
     – Adhesion/ECM molecules needed for neurite outgrowth (CDH13/18, LRFN, LRRC, CNTN/CNTNAP).  
     – ENS-specific or vagal neural crest regulators (RET pathway partners SRCIN1, GFRL-like LRFN5, HOXB cluster genes).  
   • Together, the cluster likely controls transition from proliferative neural crest cells to post-mitotic enteric (and other peripheral) neurons, coordinating axon extension, target recognition and synaptogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene set)  
   • SOX10 / SOX5/9/21 – master regulators of neural-crest fate and neuronal differentiation.  
   • PHOX2A / PHOX2B – essential for enteric- and sympathetic-neuronal gene batteries.  
   • GATA2/3 – cooperate with PHOX2 proteins during ENS neurogenesis.  
   • HOX–PBX/MEIS complexes (HOXB1/3/5/7, PBX1-4, MEIS1/2) – impart rostro-caudal identity to vagal crest that seeds the ENS.  
   • RFX & MEF2 motifs – support ciliogenesis/axoneme genes and activity-dependent maturation, respectively.  
   • ETS (ELK/ETV/FLI) and KLF/EGR families – linked to neurite growth and immediate-early neuronal responses.

In summary, peak-cluster 12_8 represents a late-somite-stage, neuron-restricted regulatory module, predominately active in vagal/enteric neural-crest derivatives and differentiating neurons, orchestrated by SOX10-PHOX2-GATA-HOX/PBX factors to drive axonogenesis, synaptic wiring and functional maturation of the enteric nervous system.
]

## Cluster 12_9

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 12_9 represents a paraxial-mesoderm / somitogenesis module

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already detectable at the 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf) but rises steadily and shows a sharp spike at the 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf).  
• The largest jump (≈4 → 15.6 a.u.) occurs in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) between 20- and 30-somites, coinciding with the last round of segment formation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is seen in mesodermal populations that make somites:  
• Presomitic mesoderm (especially 30-somites)  
• Newly formed somites / mature muscle blocks (somite, fast-/slow-muscle pseudobulks)  
• Neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs) show intermediate levels; most ectodermal and endodermal derivatives are low or near background.  

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Associated genes and motif content are enriched for classical segmentation, A-P patterning and early myogenesis factors:  
• Somitogenesis clock / segmentation: mespab, mespaa, her/hes genes, ripply-like, uncx, dll/lfng motifs.  
• Antero-posterior identity: dense clusters of posterior Hox (hoxa9-13, hoxb4-10, hoxc9-13, hoxd9-13).  
• Early myotome differentiation: tbx6/16/18, tbx3/5, mef2, myf5/myod motifs and genes.  
• Wnt/FGF/Notch pathway components (wnt6b, fgf10b, delta-like genes) that drive clock–wavefront dynamics.  
• Nuclear receptor & retinoid signalling genes (nr2f/COUP-TF, rarg, ror, rxr) which set rostro-caudal polarity.  
Together these point to a programme that builds, patterns and matures somites while beginning skeletal-muscle differentiation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (high-scoring motifs & expressed genes)  
• Posterior HOX cluster TFs – core of A-P code (hoxb9/10, hoxc10/11, hoxd9/10/11/13).  
• T-box factors – Tbx16/Tbx6, Tbx18/5 that drive paraxial mesoderm fate and myotome onset.  
• MESP (Mesp-a/b) & Ripply partners – segmentation boundary specification.  
• MEF2 & SRF family – first wave of myogenic differentiation.  
• COUP-TF/Nr2f & ROR nuclear receptors – retinoid gradient read-out.  
• PAX3/7 and FOXF/FOXC – dorsal dermomyotome and mesoderm enhancers.  
• E2F/TFDP motifs – match the proliferative PSM compartment.

In summary, peak-cluster 12_9 marks regulatory elements that switch on late in somitogenesis, are most open in presomitic mesoderm and nascent somites, and orchestrate the Hox-, Tbx- and Mesp-centred network that patterns and differentiates the embryonic axial musculature.
]

## Cluster 12_10

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 12_10 represents a broad “neuronal maturation / rostro–caudal patterning” module

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already measurable at the 0- to 5-somite stage (10–11 hpf) but steadily rises through segmentation, peaking between 20- and 30-somites (≈22–24 hpf).  
• Most non-neural tissues (e.g. epidermis, early NMPs) lose accessibility by 30 somites, whereas neural derivatives keep climbing (enteric-neurons jump from 6.4 → 17.5).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Differentiating CNS neurons – hindbrain, spinal cord, floor-plate, optic cup.  
• Peripheral neural crest derivatives – enteric neurons, pharyngeal-arches, cranial ganglia.  
• Moderate in axial progenitors (NMPs/PSM) early on, and in heart / fast-muscle, but these decline later.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
Enriched gene set is packed with:  
• Axon guidance / synapse assembly: ROBO1/2/3, NRXN2, RIMS2, TENM2, EGFLAM, LRRC4, CADM1/2, CNTNAPs, SEMA3/5/6, EPH/EPHB, SLIT3.  
• Calcium- and sodium-channel sub-units (CACNA2D1, CACNA1x, KCN families) and neurotransmitter receptors/transporters (GABRB2, GRM5, GRIN2C, SLC6/8/16).  
• Extracellular-matrix / adhesion genes (COL19A1, TNC, FAT4, FLNB, VIT).  
• Many HOX, LHX, PHOX2, ISL, LIM and PBX cofactors.  

Together these point to a programme that establishes neuronal identity along the AP axis, promotes axon path-finding and begins synaptogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene co-expression)  
• HOX-PBX-MEIS complex – strong motif set (HOX, PBX, MEIS, TGIF, PKNox) matches the long HOX gene list and the sharp rise in trunk/enteric neurons.  
• SOX family (Sox2/3/5/10/11/21) – canonical neural stem / early neurogenic regulators.  
• Forkhead factors (Foxd3, Foxg1, Foxp1/2/4, Foxl1) – neural-crest and forebrain/trunk patterning.  
• LIM-homeodomain and LHX/ISL/UNCX group – motor-neuron and interneuron subtype specification.  
• bHLH neurogenic factors (NeuroD/Neurog/Ascl, Atoh1/7) – drive terminal neuronal differentiation.  
• E2F & KDM2 (low-level motifs) likely reflect early progenitor proliferation phase that subsides later.

Summary – Cluster 12_10 marks regulatory elements that switch on as progenitors exit the cell cycle and differentiate into regionally-patterned neurons of the CNS and PNS. It is first accessible in broad progenitors, then becomes highly neuron-specific, orchestrated by HOX–PBX/MEIS positional cues together with SOX, FOX and bHLH neurogenic TFs to activate axon-guidance, adhesion and synaptic genes necessary for early circuit assembly.
]

## Cluster 12_11

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 12_11 marks a set of regulatory elements that switch on just as neurogenesis moves from progenitor proliferation to terminal neuronal specification.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest (≈1-fold over background) at 10–15 somites, rises sharply by 20 somites (≈22-fold in the optic-cup sample) and remains very high at 24 hpf (≈15-fold in 30-somite enteric-neurons).  
   • This timing coincides with the onset of terminal differentiation of sensory-retinal cells and peripheral/enteric neurons.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest signals are seen in neural derivatives:  
   • Optic-cup / retinal progenitors (20 somites) – strongest signal overall.  
   • Enteric and other differentiating neurons (late somite stages).  
   • Moderate, broad accessibility in generic “differentiating-neuron” and CNS/PNS progenitor clusters.  
   Non-neural lineages show only baseline (~1) accessibility, indicating a neuro-restricted program.

3. Likely regulatory program  
   The peak list is tethered to hundreds of neuron-specific genes:  
   – Synaptic adhesion / wiring: CNTNAP2/3, NLGN3, NRXN3, TENM2, KIRREL3, LRRC4, SDK1, UNC5C, DOCK4/7, ROBO-like genes.  
   – Excitability & calcium handling: CACNA1D/A2D1, RYR2, HCN3, TRPC5/7, SLC6A1/8.  
   – Axon guidance & patterning: ERBB4, NGFRA, FOXP1, DCC-family member UNC5C, POU6F2.  
   – Retinal / sensory identity factors: OTX/CRX family (rx1/2/3, otx2/otx5), PAX6, RAX-like genes.  
   – Enteric-neuron determinants: PHOX2A/B, SOX10, PRRX1, HOX-cluster members.  
   Together these peaks appear to drive late neuronal maturation—establishing excitability, synapse formation and subtype identity, especially in visual and enteric systems.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and factor mapping point to:  
   • PAX6 / RAX (retinal neurogenesis, optic-cup peak).  
   • SOX family (SOX2, SOX4/11/14, SOX10) – neurogenic competence and enteric-crest specification.  
   • FOXG1 / FOXP1-4 – neuronal subtype identity and axonal path-finding.  
   • RFX & NFAT/ROR nuclear-receptor motifs – ciliary/neuronal and activity-dependent programs.  
   • MEF2 & NEUROD/ATOH/TCF-bHLH signatures – terminal differentiation and synaptic gene activation.  
   • HOX/PBX/MEIS combinations – rostro-caudal & peripheral (enteric) neuronal patterning.

In summary, cluster 12_11 represents late-onset neuronal enhancer elements, peaking around 20–24 hpf in retinal and enteric neuron lineages, under the control of classic eye-field (PAX6/RX/OTX), neurogenic SOX/FOX factors and HOX/PBX modulators to coordinate synapse formation, excitability and neuronal subtype specification.

## Cluster 12_12

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 12_12 marks a vascular / haemato-vascular enhancer program that comes on progressively during segmentation and reaches maximal activity at the end of the 24 hpf series.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• 10 hpf (0–5 somites): low baseline accessibility (~2–3).  
• 10–22 hpf (10–20 somites): steady increase (4–12 in haematopoietic-vasculature pseudobulks).  
• 24 hpf (30 somites): sharp spike – most striking in  
  – haematopoietic-vasculature (12.5)  
  – hemangioblasts (10.4)  
  – enteric-neurons (15.6; reflecting the neuro-vascular niche along the gut).  
Hence the cluster is a late-segmentation/early-organogenesis module that turns on as vessels mature.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Haematopoietic-vasculature lineage (hemangioblasts → endothelial cells).  
• Vascular‐associated mesoderm (lateral plate / heart myocardium show moderate signal).  
• Enteric neural crest–derived neurons at 30 somites (likely due to shared neuro-vascular enhancers active along the gut tube).  
Other tissues remain at background levels.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
Enriched genes encode canonical endothelial / angiogenic factors:  
  – flt1 (VEGFR-1), egfl7, esama, spns2/3, ptgis, msna, lamb1b, fgf24, corin, gfi1aa/b.  
  – ECM remodellers (adamts10, adam19b, adamts).  
  – Cell-adhesion / guidance (itga8, plxna1a, plxna2, nrg1, grb10a).  
  – RA/NR nuclear-receptor targets (rarga/b, rxra/b, nr2f1/2).  
GO/KEGG interpretation: vascular tube formation, endothelial junction assembly, angiogenic sprouting, and RA-modulated vascular maturation; secondary involvement in neuro-vascular patterning of the gut (enteric ENS arrival).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + mapping)  
• ETS family: Fli1, Erg, Etv2/Etv1/Etv4 (highest ETS motif Z-scores) – master regulators of zebrafish endothelial/haemangioblast identity.  
• Nuclear receptors: RAR/RXR (rarga/b, rxra/b), NR2F/COUP-TF, PPAR, ROR – consistent with RA and lipid-metabolism signalling that stabilise vessels.  
• SOXF subgroup (sox7/17/18) and GATA2/6 – synergistic with ETS during vasculogenesis.  
• KLF2/6 and FOX (foxf2a, foxd1/3) motifs – flow-responsive endothelial and endothelio-mesenchymal regulators.  
• Moderate E2F/KDM2 cell-cycle signatures reflect proliferative endothelial progenitors.  

Together, peak-cluster 12_12 represents a late-onset, endothelial/haemato-vascular enhancer set governed mainly by ETS-RAR/NR-SOXF-GATA factors that drives angiogenesis and maturation of the embryonic vascular network while also being reused in the developing neuro-vascular interface of enteric neurons.

## Cluster 12_13

[*assistant*:
Peak Cluster 12_13 captures an unusually broad, “pan-neuro-mesodermal” regulatory program that rises gradually during axis extension and then stays on in multiple neural derivatives while being largely shut down in paraxial mesoderm.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already moderate at gastrula/0-somite (10 hpf) in most lineages (≈1.3–1.5).  
• It increases through segmentation (5- to 20-somite), peaking between 15- and 24 hpf.  
• Paraxial mesoderm (PSM / somitic mesoderm) loses the signal by 30-somites (~24 hpf), whereas neural tissues retain or further elevate it (e.g. enteric neurons jump to 15 × baseline).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
Rank-ordered by ≈24 hpf (30-somite) pseudobulks:  
• Enteric neurons ≫ differentiating neurons / spinal cord / hindbrain / optic cup / telencephalon.  
• Neural‐crest derivatives (pharyngeal arches, melanocytes) and floor-plate.  
• NMPs (neuromesodermal progenitors) and early PSM are high early but drop later.  
• Endoderm, epidermis, heart, etc. show only baseline levels.  
Thus the cluster marks the NMP→neuronal branch and then many maturing neural sub-types.

3. Likely biological processes / pathways  
Gene set is enriched for:  
• Axon guidance and synaptogenesis (eph/ephrin, robo/slit, cadm, nrx/neuroligin, gria/grin, cacna, kcn channels).  
• Neuronal differentiation & migration (neurod, lmx1, phox2, otx/gbx, dlx, hox neuro-axis regulators).  
• Calcium signalling and neurotransmitter receptors (gaba, glutamate, piezo, trp).  
• Residual mesoderm/axon trunk patterning genes (tbx, pax3/7, cdx, wnt6, vangl2) consistent with NMP origin.

Altogether, the peak set seems to represent enhancers that turn on in axial NMPs, stay open in neuro-epithelial derivatives, and are later reused to build diverse CNS/PNS neurons.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif/TF enrichment points to three cooperating TF families:

• SOX / FOX (neural progenitor & NMP maintenance)  
  Sox2/3/11/14/21; FoxA/FoxD/FoxP/FoxG motifs are among the strongest.

• HOX / PBX / MEIS (antero-posterior positional identity)  
  Dense HOX, PBX/MEIS and UNC-class motifs explain broad use along the trunk.

• NEUROGENIC bHLH & MEF2 (neuronal differentiation/maturation)  
  NeuroD, Atoh, Olig, Mef2, plus RUNX and Ets (Fli1, Etv) motifs high in late-stage neural samples.

Supporting regulators: PAX3/7 (NMP & dorsal neural crest), IRX and LHX homeodomain proteins, NFAT/CREB (activity-dependent maturation).

Summary  
Peak Cluster 12_13 marks enhancers first active in neuromesodermal progenitors during mid-segmentation and subsequently in a wide array of neuronal and neural-crest lineages, controlled by SOX/FOX pioneer factors, HOX-PBX positional factors and neurogenic bHLH regulators.

## Cluster 13_0

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 13_0 captures an “early-patterning” regulatory module that is switched on during segmentation and is progressively shut down as tissues leave the progenitor state.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is highest from gastrulation through the early-somite stages (0–10 somites, ≈10–14 hpf).  
   • Most tissues show a steady decline thereafter (e.g. NMPs 10.3 → 5.5, hindbrain 10.9 → 7.2).  
   • An isolated spike in notochord at 30 somites (276) is likely an outlier or reflects a very small set of hyper-accessible sites rather than sustained late activity.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest values)  
   • Axial & paraxial mesoderm: notochord, early somites, presomitic mesoderm.  
   • Neuroectodermal progenitors: differentiating neurons, hindbrain, MHB, neural floor plate.  
   • Multipotent progenitor pools (NMPs, tail-bud) also score highly early on.  
   Thus the cluster marks broadly distributed but still progenitor-like territories that give rise to trunk neural and mesodermal lineages.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Gene list is enriched for patterning and growth regulators (Hox genes, Otx1/2/5, Pax6, Gbx, Msx, Dlx, Lhx, Nkx), cell-cycle drivers (E2F targets, Mcm, Cdc families) and signalling components (Wnt5b/2b, Fgf11/fgfr2, Smad1/2).  
   • GO/pathway implication: anterior–posterior axial patterning, hindbrain/midbrain regionalisation, segmentation clock output, and rapid progenitor proliferation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif & expression concordance)  
   • Patterning homeobox factors: HoxB1/B2/B3/B5, Hoxa2/4, Otx1/2/5, Gbx1/2, Barhl, Pitx1/2/3, Uncx, Lhx family, Msx1/2/3, Dlx2/4/5.  
   • Proliferation gate-keepers: E2F1/2/3/5/7/8 with dimer partner TFDP1/2.  
   • Neural-progenitor determinants: Pax6, Sox2/3/14/19, Nkx family, Crx/VSX.  
   • General chromatin activators: Kdm2b/Cxxc1 and Fox (FoxA/B/D/F/K) motifs, matching many Fox TFs expressed in early germ layers.

Taken together, peak cluster 13_0 delineates the cis-regulatory landscape used by rapidly dividing trunk neuro-mesodermal progenitors and early neural plate/hinge cells to execute axial patterning programmes before lineage-specific chromatin landscapes take over later in organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 13_1

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 13_1 – concise interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest and fairly uniform during early somitogenesis (0–15 som) but rises sharply after 20 somites and peaks at 30 somites (~24 hpf).  
   • The most dramatic increase (> 40-fold above baseline) is seen at the 30-somite stage, indicating that these regulatory regions open during the transition from neuroepithelial progenitors to differentiated sensory/neuronal lineages in early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility (30 som stage values)  
   • Optic cup / retina (271.7) – by far the strongest signal  
   • Differentiating neurons (CNS), hindbrain, spinal cord, mid-brain–hind-brain boundary  
   • Enteric neurons and other neural-crest-derived neurons  
   • Moderate in endocrine pancreas (shared Onecut/Pdx1 program); low in mesodermal or endodermal non-neural tissues.  
   Interpretation: the cluster is retina-centred but broadly marks neurogenic territories.

3. Biological programme represented  
   Associated gene list is enriched for:  
   • Neuronal adhesion / synapse genes – nrxn2b, syngap1a, sema6e/bb, gfra3, ptpr family  
   • Neurotransmission & excitability – GRIK2, gabra4, p2rx3a, adcy2a, camk2g1, cacna1ab/g  
   • Axon guidance / neurotrophin signalling – ngfra, ntrk3b, rock2b, gna14a  
   • Retina / photoreceptor markers – rcvrn3, tyrp1b, otx, crx‐related genes  
   • Neural-specific chromatin factors – MDFIC, Klf5b, Esrrb, etc.  
   Together these point to enhancers that control late neurogenesis, especially retinal and other sensory-neuron differentiation, axon outgrowth and synaptic maturation.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
   Motif enrichment and TF-mapping highlight a canonical eye-field / retinal network plus general neurogenic factors:  
   • Rx / Rax (rx1/2/3) – retina founder factor  
   • Six3 / Six6 / Six7 and Otx1/2/5 – specify anterior neuroectoderm & retina  
   • Pax6 – pan-eye and neural progenitor regulator  
   • Crx, Vsx1, Barhl1/2, Vax1/2 – photoreceptor & retinal ganglion differentiation  
   • Sox family (Sox2, Sox4/5/11/19) – neural competence & early differentiation  
   • Onecut (OC1/2/3), Pbx/Meis/Tgif/Pknox – cooperative eye-field cofactors  
   • E2F/Tfdp – cell-cycle control of proliferating retinal progenitors.  

Overall, peak cluster 13 _1 corresponds to a retina-/sensory-neuron enhancer module that opens late in somitogenesis, predominates in the optic cup and other neurogenic domains, and is governed by Rx–Six–Otx–Pax6-centred transcriptional circuitry to drive neuronal differentiation, axon guidance and synapse formation in the developing zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 13_2

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 13_2 captures the regulatory landscape of the emerging vascular / endothelium-haemangioblast compartment during early somitogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low at 0-somite stage but rises sharply by 5 somites (~12 hpf), stays high through 10-, 15- and 20-somite stages and remains elevated at 30 somites (24 hpf).  
   • The profile therefore marks the window when the first endothelial tubes and blood-forming endothelial cells are specified and begin to remodel.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Hematopoietic / vascular endothelium pseudobulks (hemangioblasts and “hematopoietic-vasculature” populations) – strongest signal (scores ≈ 50-80).  
   • Endocardial / heart-myocardium and lateral-plate mesoderm – moderate signal.  
   • Only modest accessibility in neural, muscle or endodermal derivatives; optic-cup shows a single early spike that rapidly falls off and is likely incidental.

3. Regulatory program inferred  
   • Gene set is a textbook endothelial signature: kdrl/kdr, flt4 (Vegfr3), egfl7, tie1, ptpreb, gja5a, plpp3, fmnl3, vsir, wnt5b, foxo1a, pgk1, stim2b.  
   • Functional enrichment therefore points to vasculogenesis / angiogenic sprouting, lumen formation, vascular barrier establishment and shear-stress–responsive metabolism.  
   • Concomitant presence of runx1/3, gata2/3 and tal1 motifs suggests coupling to haemogenic endothelium and early blood specification.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched and biologically relevant)  
   • ETS family: Etv2, Fli1, Erg, Elk1/3/4 – master activators of endothelial gene programs.  
   • FOX factors: Foxc1/2, Foxf1/2, Foxo1 – cooperate with ETS factors in arterial-venous patterning and flow response.  
   • SOX-F subgroup: Sox7, Sox17, Sox18 – reinforce endothelial identity.  
   • GATA2/3 and RUNX1 – link to haemato-vascular differentiation.  
   • KLF2/6 and NFAT (Nfatc1/2/4) – shear-stress and angiogenic signalling modulators.  

In sum, peak cluster 13_2 represents a temporally restricted, endothelium-centric chromatin program that turns on at the onset of circulation, is most accessible in haemangioblast / endothelial lineages, and is driven by the canonical ETS-FOX-SOX-GATA transcription-factor network that orchestrates zebrafish blood-vessel formation and early haematopoiesis.
]

## Cluster 13_3

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 13_3 – concise interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• First detectable already at 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf), where it shows an extreme spike in the optic-cup/eye-field pseudobulk (286 a.u.).  
• Accessibility then rises steadily during somitogenesis, reaching maximum values in 20–30-somite embryos, especially in differentiating- and enteric-neuronal pools (e.g. enteric neurons: 13 → 69 a.u.; differentiating neurons: 7 → 29 a.u.).  
• Thus, the module is switched on very early in anterior neuroectoderm, but its utilisation expands and intensifies as neurons mature.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Eye field / optic cup (retina) – very high at the earliest time point.  
• Differentiating spinal/brain neurons.  
• Enteric neurons (fastest late-stage gain).  
• Modest/background levels in most other germ-layer derivatives.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
• Associated genes encode synaptic receptors (GRID1/2, GRIN2, GABRB3/4, GABBR2), axon-guidance and adhesion molecules (NRXN1/2, ROBO2, PCDHs, CTNNA2, DSCAML1), neuronal signalling enzymes/channels (ADCY2, KCNQ5, TRPM3, KCNG1) and neuro-developmental TFs (EBF3, TLX3b, OTX‐/RX-family).  
→ Collectively point to neurogenesis, axon targeting and synaptogenesis, with a strong bias toward sensory/visceral (retinal & enteric) neuron identity and maturation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs strongly enriched & present in mapping)  
• Eye-field / retinal core: Rx (rx1/2/3), Otx1/2, Crx, Lhx2, Pax6, Six3/6, Vsx (Chx10).  
• Pan-neuronal / interneuron: SoxB (Sox2/3/11/14/21), proneural bHLH (NeuroD1/4/6, Atoh1/7, Ascl1), LIM-homeobox (Lhx1/5/9), Dlx/Msx, TLX3, PHOX2A/B.  
• Late maturation / activity-dependent: MEF2, CREB/ATF, ROR/NR2F nuclear receptors.  
• Early proliferation component: E2F1/2/3 & FoxM1 motifs.

Together these factors specify retinal progenitors, generic neuronal differentiation programmes, and later enteric/interneuron subtype traits, explaining the temporal and cell-type pattern observed.
]

## Cluster 13_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 13_4 captures a ‘late-myogenic’ regulatory program that turns on at the end of somitogenesis and is shared by paraxial- and cardiac-muscle lineages.

1. Temporal dynamics   
   • Accessibility is modest and fairly constant from gastrulation to ~20-somite stage (10–19 hpf) but explodes at the 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf).  
   • The jump is most striking in the 30-somite samples (Somites_30 ≈ 270 a.u.; Heart-myocardium_30 ≈ 51 a.u.), indicating that the elements in this cluster open just as skeletal muscle fibres and the embryonic heart begin terminal differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Somites / skeletal-muscle lineage – very high in Somites_30, Muscle_30 and Fast-muscle_30.  
   • Heart myocardium – second-highest signal at 30 somites.  
   • Moderate signal in presomitic mesoderm, NMPs and other mesodermal derivatives; low in endoderm, neural and epidermal populations.  

3. Biological processes likely regulated  
   Gene set is enriched for:  
   • Sarcomere assembly & contractile apparatus (tmod1, tnmd, pdlim2, tpm-related regulators).  
   • Muscle/ECM remodelling and adhesion (hdac4/5, mmp24, angpt1, col7a1, plxna4).  
   • Cardiac morphogenesis & conduction (tbxas1, pdzk1, kcnq4, angpt1, zeb2a).  
   • Cell-cycle exit of differentiating myocytes (many E2F-target genes, cdks, hdac4/5).  
   Together these functions point to terminal differentiation and maturation of skeletal and cardiac muscle.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
   • MEF2 family (mef2aa/ab/b/c/d) – canonical activators of late myogenesis.  
   • Myogenic bHLH factors: MyoD1, Myf5, Myf6, Myog – consistent with skeletal-muscle identity.  
   • SRF and TEAD1/3 – cooperate with MEF2 in sarcomere and actin-cytoskeleton genes.  
   • Cardiac TFs: Nkx2-5/2-7, Tbx5/20, GATA4/5/6, Hand2/Tcf21 – explain the strong heart signal.  
   • E2F1/2/3/5/7/8 and TFDP1/2 motifs – reflect the E2F switch that accompanies cell-cycle withdrawal and differentiation.  
   • Fox and Sox motifs appear but at lower enrichment and probably reflect broader mesodermal accessibility rather than drivers.

In summary, cluster 13_4 represents a cohort of enhancers/promoters that are opened at the end of somitogenesis to drive the terminal differentiation programs of both skeletal-muscle fibres in the somites and cardiomyocytes in the embryonic heart, orchestrated chiefly by MEF2, MyoD-family, SRF/TEAD and cardiac Nkx2-/Tbx/GATA factors.
]

## Cluster 13_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 13_5 marks a set of regulatory regions that “switch on” late in segmentation and become almost exclusively open in the optic cup / nascent retina.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low-to-moderate (< ~5) from 0-20-somite stages but rises sharply after 20 somites and peaks at 30 somites (≈ 24 hpf).  
   • The single highest value (≈ 270) occurs at optic_cup 30-somites; other tissues never exceed ~65, indicating a late, retina-specific burst of chromatin opening.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility (rank-ordered):  
   • Optic cup / retinal neuro-epithelium (by far the dominant signal).  
   • A secondary, much smaller increase in posterior neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) and tail-bud at 30 somites, likely reflecting shared homeobox/Sox enhancer usage in axial progenitors.  
   • All other neural or mesodermal populations stay at baseline.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Gene set and GO themes point to eye-field / retinal neurogenesis:  
   • Key retina/optic-cup genes: rx1/2/3 (motifs), six3/6/7, otx1/2/5, crx, vsx1, pax6, barhl1/2, fezf, dlx, alx4, meis, gfi1, ush1c, gpr176, npnta, ntn1a, ntrk3a, epha4b/ephb2b, ctnna2.  
   • Pathways: retinoic-acid signalling (rara/rarg/rxra motifs), Hedgehog/Gli, Eph–Ephrin-mediated axon guidance, photoreceptor differentiation, basement-membrane/ECM remodelling (adam12/17, pxdn).  
   • The minor NMP/tail-bud activity likely reflects shared Hox/Cdx/T brachyury elements that are also present in several associated enhancers.

4. Likely driver transcription factors  
   Motif enrichment together with the TF-mapping table highlights classical eye-field regulators:  
   • Pax6a/b – master selector for optic-cup and early retina.  
   • Rx (rx1/2/3) and Six3/6/7 – establish eye-field identity and activate photoreceptor programmes.  
   • Otx2/Otx5 and Crx – photoreceptor and bipolar-cell differentiation.  
   • Vsx1, Barhl1/2 – retinal bipolar & ganglion fate.  
   • Meis/Pbx/Prep homeoproteins – co-factors for Pax/Six in eye and mid-brain boundary.  
   • Nuclear receptors RAR/RXR and NR2F (COUP-TF) – retinoic-acid responsiveness of these enhancers.  
   • Supporting factors: Sox2/3/19 (neuro-epithelial), E2F/TFDP (cell-cycle burst in proliferating retinal progenitors).

In summary, peak-cluster 13_5 represents late-acting retina/optic-cup enhancers that are opened as proliferative retinal progenitors arise and begin neuronal specification around 22-24 hpf, driven primarily by the Pax6–Rx–Six/Otx/Crx transcription-factor network under retinoic-acid control.
]

## Cluster 13_6

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 13_6 captures a regulatory module that switches from an early fore-gut/secretory program to a late retinal neuro-sensory program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• 10–14 hpf (0–10 somites): very high accessibility in hatching-gland primordium (≈65 a.u.) and endocrine-pancreas progenitors (≈20 a.u.).  
• 14–18 hpf (15 somites): accessibility begins to rise in optic-cup epithelium.  
• 18–24 hpf (20–30 somites): dramatic spike in the optic cup/retina (≈300 a.u. at 30 somites) while hatching-gland and pancreatic signals taper.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest to moderate)  
1) Optic-cup / prospective retina (photoreceptor precursors).  
2) Hatching-gland cells (chorionase-secreting epithelium).  
3) Endocrine-pancreas endoderm (early β-/δ-cell progenitors).  
Minor but consistent signal in generic endoderm and neural tube derivatives.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
• Photoreceptor differentiation, outer-segment/cilia assembly and circadian entrainment (genes: NR2E3, KCTD8, LRIT3b, MDGA1, NPAS2, ROR family).  
• Secretory/endocrine maturation – exocytosis, lipid handling, glycosylation (SEC14L1, STX3A, ST8SIA1, GLIS3, TMEM132C, RAB11FIP3).  
• Extracellular matrix remodelling crucial for both retina morphogenesis and hatching-gland enzyme release (ADAMTS9, ANGPTL1a).  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
• Photoreceptor / retina: NR2E3, RORα/β (nuclear receptors), BHLHE40/41 & CLOCK/NPAS2 circadian bHLHs, PAX6, IRX and RFX family (RFX4/6).  
• Secretory/endocrine: GLIS3, RFX6, FOXA/F, SOX4/9, GATA4/6.  
• Cell-cycle initiation during organ bud growth: E2F1/2/3/5/7/8 cluster.  

Taken together, peak cluster 13_6 marks cis-regulatory elements that first license secretory fore-gut derivatives (hatching gland, nascent endocrine pancreas) and are subsequently co-opted for the rapid chromatin opening needed for retinal neuro-sensory (photoreceptor) differentiation and circadian gene regulation at 20–24 hpf.
]

## Cluster 13_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 13_7 represents an “axial-mesoderm / notochord programme”

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at the earliest sample (0-somite, 10 hpf) and steadily falls thereafter.  
• Minor secondary activity appears in a few late 30-somite derivatives (e.g. enteric neurons), but never approaches the early peak.  
Summary: the cluster is most active during gastrulation and early somitogenesis, i.e. while the notochord is being generated and patterned.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• Dominant signal: notochord (≈ 270-fold higher than background at 0-somites).  
• Sub-threshold yet above background in axial progenitors (NMPs), pre-somitic mesoderm and, later, a subset of neural crest / enteric neurons.  
Thus the peaks are chiefly notochord-specific with a shallow footprint in closely related axial lineages.

3. Likely biological processes  
Gene set and GO inspection point to—  
• Mid-line morphogenesis & planar-cell-polarity: FAT4, CDH11, Wnt4, Cdh11, Agrn, Tenm2.  
• ECM & basement-membrane assembly required for the notochord sheath (Agrn, Col-related genes).  
• Guidance/axon-sorting molecules that the notochord supplies to adjacent neuroepithelium (Cntn4, Nrxn2, Pcdh15, Plxna2/b, Sema3f).  
• Cell-cycle & chromatin genes (E2F-targets) consistent with the rapid expansion of axial progenitors.  
Overall, the cluster captures regulatory DNA driving formation of the notochord, its extracellular sheath, and its signalling interface with overlying neural tissue.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs + expressed factors)  
Highly enriched motifs together with expression in the same cells pinpoint:  
• Brachyury/Ta (T-box) – canonical notochord master regulator; motif present and ta expressed in axial mesoderm.  
• Fox family (FoxA2, FoxD3, FoxC1/2, FoxF) – required for notochord differentiation and sheath gene activation.  
• Noto (homeobox) – mid-line identity gene; motif strongly enriched.  
• Hox & Lhx clusters – anterior-posterior patterning of the chord and its neural signalling domains.  
• E2F1/2/3/5/7/8 – reinforce the proliferative state of axial progenitors.

Taken together, peak-cluster 13_7 marks early notochord cis-regulatory elements activated by Brachyury and FOX factors to run an ECM/PCP/signalling programme that establishes and patterns the embryonic mid-line.
]

## Cluster 13_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 13_8 captures a set of regulatory elements that light up very early in the embryo and are virtually diagnostic for the forming notochord.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility skyrockets at the 0-somite stage (10 hpf) – 302.9 a.u. in notochord_0 som – and then falls step-wise to ~24 (5-/10-som), ~22 (15/20-som) and baseline (~19) by 30 som (24 hpf).  
   • In every other lineage the signal stays around the background value of 17-20. → The cluster is therefore an early, transient programme (gastrulation to early segmentation).

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Absolute peak: notochord (axial mesoderm).  
   • Secondary, much smaller enrichment: floor-plate / neural floor-plate and midline tail-bud samples, consistent with shared midline identity.  
   • All paraxial, neural-crest, endoderm, somite or muscle pseudobulks show only background levels.

3. Biological programme represented  
   • Specification and maturation of the axial mesoderm/notochord and neighbouring midline tissues.  
   • Genes correlated/overlapping with the peaks include classical notochord factors (noto, ta / brachyury, gsc, ihhb/shh-family, foxa2, raraa/rarg, col2-like matrix genes, hox axial patterning genes), pointing to:  
     – induction of Hedgehog signalling sources,  
     – establishment of anterior-posterior Hox code within the notochord,  
     – production of extracellular matrix for the vacuolated rod.  
   • Declining accessibility after 10-som suggests the elements are mainly involved in early fate acquisition rather than later structural roles.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs strongly enriched)  
   • Forkhead family (FoxA/FoxC/FoxD/FoxI) – pioneer factors indispensable for notochord and floor-plate enhancers.  
   • T-box / Brachyury (ta, tbx16/18) – core axial mesoderm regulator.  
   • Gsc & Noto motifs – midline-specific homeobox drivers.  
   • RAR/RXR nuclear-receptor motifs (raraa/rarg, rxr) – consistent with retinoid control of A-P patterning.  
   • Hox cluster motifs – reflect the graded Hox expression list in correlated genes.  
   • Secondary contributors: IRX/BarH/DMRT and RFX sets, which often cooperate in midline enhancers.

In sum, cluster 13_8 represents an early, highly notochord-specific enhancer set activated by pioneer FoxA/Brachyury/Gsc/Noto factors under retinoid and Hox modulation, peaking at gastrulation–0-somite and tapering off as the notochord matures.

## Cluster 13_9

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 13_9 captures a chromatin program that turns on during segmentation, remains high through somitogenesis, and reaches its zenith in the late (30-somite, 24 hpf) embryo.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises already at 0–5-somite stages in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP) and presomitic mesoderm (PSM), stays elevated through 10–20-somite stages, and shows an exceptional late spike at 30 somites.  
   • The extreme value in notochord_30 somites (≈ 2.9 ×10² – ten-fold higher than any other sample) marks the final burst of activity as the mid-line matures.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Axial/para-axial mesoderm lineage:  
     – Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and newly formed somites  
     – Fast and bulk trunk muscle  
   • Mid-line derivative: late notochord (30-somite) – strongest of all  
   • Secondary enrichment: tail-bud, NMPs and early muscle progenitors.  
   Neural or endodermal populations show only baseline signal.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Somitogenesis & antero-posterior patterning – large HOX, TBX and MESP motifs plus segmentation-clock genes (e.g. wnt5b, tcf7l1a).  
   • Myogenesis / musculoskeletal ECM assembly – presence of myofibrillar (myom1a, myo16, smyhc1), cytoskeletal (flnb), and collagen/ECM genes (col1a2, col5a2a, hspg2).  
   • Notochord maturation – foxa/foxc factors, pdgfrb, acvr/bmp receptors and vacuolation-associated matrix genes (flnb, ncanb, fndc3b).  
   • Cell-cycle/proliferation of growing paraxial tissue – E2F targets, dock1/9, lpar1.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
   • T-box / segmentation: T (ta), tbx2/3/5/16/20, eomesa  
   • HOX paralog groups 3–10 (hoxb5b, hoxc6/8/9) – confer trunk identity  
   • Myogenic regulators: MyoD/Myf5 and their partner MEF2 (motifs MEF2-family, SRF)  
   • Mid-line FOX factors: foxa1/2/3, foxd3, foxf2/f1; plus FoxM1/E2F for proliferation  
   • Collagen/ECM–linked bZIP & bHLH factors: ATF/CREB, BATF, BACH, MAF sub-family  
   • Co-factors highlighted by motif sets: PBX/MEIS (spatial patterning), TEAD (Yap/Taz mechanotransduction in muscle/notochord).

In summary, peak-cluster 13_9 marks the chromatin landscape of trunk mesoderm–derived tissues—PSM, somites, trunk muscle and especially the late notochord—co-regulated by T-box/HOX specification factors, myogenic MEF2/MyoD and FOX mid-line factors to drive segmentation, muscle formation and notochord maturation during the 10–24 hpf window.

## Cluster 13_10

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 13_10 highlights a maturation module that switches on midway through somitogenesis and stays on through early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already detectable at the earliest stage assayed (0-somite) but rises steadily, peaking at 20- to 30-somite stages (≈ 22-24 hpf).  
• The late-stage jump is especially pronounced in 30-somite samples, indicating that these regions are most important once terminal differentiation programs are engaged.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is seen in neuronal lineages:  
• “Differentiating neurons” and bulk “neurons” across all axial levels.  
• Regionally patterned neuro‐epithelia (hindbrain, spinal cord, telencephalon, optic, MHB).  
A secondary signal is present in fast / trunk muscle at 30 somites but is minor compared with the pan-neuronal signal and probably reflects contaminating neural crest-derived synaptic cells within the muscle prep.

3. Regulatory program inferred  
Correlated/overlapping genes are strongly enriched for components of synaptogenesis and electrical excitability:  
• Ion-channel / Ca2+-handling genes – ryr1b, itpr1a, kcnq2b/5b, nalcn, slc12a5a.  
• Glutamatergic and GABAergic receptor subunits – grin2a/b/d, gabbr1b, grm5b.  
• Synaptic scaffold / adhesion – shank2b, dlg4b (PSD-95), cntnap2b, ctnna2, pcdh15a, sema5a.  
• Cytoskeleton / axon guidance – adamts9, srgap3, ssh2b, traf3ip1.  
Together these peaks mark the transition from generic neural progenitors to electrically active, synaptically connected neurons.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment plus TF-mapping point to a cooperative neurogenic network:  
• Pro-neural bHLH factors: Neurod/Neurog, Atoh1/7, Olig2 – initiate neuronal differentiation.  
• SoxC family (Sox4/11) and SoxB (Sox2/3/19) – maintain neural competence and promote neurite growth.  
• Homeobox patterning factors: Pax6/7, Lhx, Dlx, Barhl – confer regional neuronal identity.  
• Activity-dependent regulators: MEF2 (mef2a/b/c/d) and TEAD (Hippo–YAP/TAZ) motifs – link calcium influx to gene expression during synaptic maturation.  
• E2F/Kdm2-CXXC motifs – consistent with cell-cycle exit coupled to differentiation.  
• REST motif is depleted (Rest appears only once), matching derepression of neuronal genes.

In summary, cluster 13_10 demarcates late-somitogenesis enhancers that drive neuronal maturation and synaptogenesis across the central nervous system, orchestrated by Sox, bHLH/NeuroD, Pax6/Barhl/Lhx homeobox factors, and activity-regulated MEF2/TEAD programs.

## Cluster 13_11

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 13_11 represents a broad but clearly neural-biased set of regulatory elements that switch on as the embryo leaves gastrulation and enters overt neurogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at the 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf) but rises steadily through segmentation, reaching its maximum at 20- to 30-somite stages (≈19–24 hpf).  
   • The very large values in late samples (e.g. neurons_30 somites, midbrain-hindbrain boundary 20 somites, optic cup 0–5 somites) indicate that the cluster is most active during early organogenesis when post-mitotic neurons are being born and wiring begins.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Differentiating neurons across the neuro-axis (hind-/mid-/fore-brain, spinal cord).  
   • Optic cup / retinal neuroepithelium.  
   • Midbrain–hindbrain boundary cells.  
   • Floor-plate / neural floor-plate.  
   (Fast-muscle shows a transient signal at 5 somites but is minor relative to neural lineages.)

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Gene set points to neuronal maturation and wiring:  
   – Axon guidance / neurite outgrowth: sema3aa, sema5a, epha3, ksr2, angptl6.  
   – Synaptic specification & transmission: cacna1g, slc1a7a, slc8a2b, st6gal1, stxbp5a, htr2cl1, htr4.  
   – Adhesion / migration: cdh2 (N-cadherin), cdh4, igsf5b, mdga2a.  
   – Neural patterning TFs in the gene list (fo﻿xp2, nf1b, kcnab2b) further underscore a CNS programme.  
   Altogether the cluster marks enhancers/promoters that drive the transition from proliferative neural progenitors to subtype-specified, axon-extending neurons in brain and retina.

4. Likely driver transcription factors  
   Motif enrichment and TF–motif mapping highlight a coherent set of neural regulators:  
   • Pioneer / progenitor factors: Sox family (Sox2/3/19/21, Sox11/14), FoxG/FoxP, Pax6.  
   • Regional patterning factors: Otx (fore-/mid-brain), Irx, Barhl, Dlx, Lhx, Uncx, Hox (particularly anterior classes).  
   • Differentiation / wiring factors: NeuroD/Neurog, Atoh1/7, Mef2 family (activity-dependent maturation), Tcf/Lef and E-box bHLH partners.  
   • Cell-cycle exit coupling: E2F1/2/3/4/7 motifs (seen together with neuronal genes) are typical of late cell-cycle genes that become repurposed during neuronal birth.

In summary, peak-cluster 13_11 captures the chromatin programme that turns on across the central nervous system and retina between ~10 and 24 hpf, orchestrated by Sox-Fox-Pax6-Barhl/Otx/Dlx TF combinations to activate genes required for neuronal differentiation, axon guidance and early synaptogenesis.
]

## Cluster 13_12

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 13_12 captures the cis-regulatory program that builds the zebrafish eye—starting with the anterior neuroectoderm/eye-field and culminating in optic-cup and nascent retinal neurons/photoreceptors.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already above background in anterior neural tissues at 0–10-somite stages, but it rises sharply after 15 somites and shows an explosive peak at 30 somites (≈ 24 hpf).  
   • The >10-fold jump in the neural_optic 30 somites sample (317.9, compared with single-digit values elsewhere) indicates that many of these elements open only during optic-cup maturation / early retinogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Neural_optic lineage (eye field / optic cup / retinal progenitors) – dominant signal.  
   • Floor-plate and hindbrain neuroepithelium show moderate early accessibility (consistent with shared anterior neural plate origin).  
   • Minor but coherent signal in photoreceptor-rich tissues (optic_cup columns) and in hindbrain/forebrain neuronal pseudobulks.

3. Biological processes likely regulated  
   • Eye-field specification and optic-cup morphogenesis (pax6, rx1/2/3, six3/6/7, otx1/2, lhx2).  
   • Initiation of retinal neurogenesis and photoreceptor subtype commitment (crx, nrl, maf genes, nr2e3, vsx1/2, neurod1/4/6).  
   • Retinoic-acid and thyroid-hormone signaling pathways (rara/rarg, rxr, thrab/b).  
   • Rapid progenitor proliferation preceding neurogenesis (E2F-TFDP module).  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + correlated gene set)  
   • Eye-field / anterior neural plate: Pax6a/b, Rx1/2/3, Six6/7, Otx1/2, Lhx2.  
   • Retinal neuronal/photoreceptor lineage: Crx, Vsx1/2, Nrl & large/ small Maf family (mafa/mafba/mafb/mafga), Nr2e3.  
   • General neurogenic regulators: Sox2/3/11, NeuroD family, Atoh1/7.  
   • Progenitor proliferation module: E2F1/2/3/4/7/8 with TFDP1/2.  
   • Signaling-responsive nuclear receptors: RAR (rarga/b), RXR (rxraa/b), COUP-TFs (nr2f1/2), THRs (thraa/b), RORs.

Taken together, cluster 13_12 marks enhancers/promoters that switch on as the optic vesicle becomes an optic cup and the first retinal neurons/photoreceptors begin to differentiate, driven by the canonical Pax–Rx–Six–Otx eye network and photoreceptor-specific TFs.
]

## Cluster 13_13

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 13_13 represents a late-onset, eye-field / early-retina regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low-to-moderate from 0–20 somites (10–20 hpf) and explodes at 30 somites (~24 hpf).  
   • The sharp rise coincides with optic-cup evagination and the beginning of retinal neurogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • By far the highest signal is in optic-cup cells at 30 somites (≈ 270-fold above baseline).  
   • Secondary but much lower accessibility is seen in epidermis and generic neuro-ectodermal pseudobulks, but no other lineage approaches the optic-cup signal.  
   • Hence the cluster is essentially optic-cup / early-retina-specific.

3. Implied regulatory programme  
   Genes linked to the peaks encode:  
   – Eye-field / retinal TFs and competence factors (Rx3, Otx1/2, Crx, Pax6, Six3/6, Vsx1, Npas3).  
   – Neuronal differentiation/axon-guidance components (SEMA4F, DOCK3/9, RIMBP2, GRIN2D-like, SCN1L, KCNMA1).  
   – Synapse and membrane remodelling proteins (ANK3, XKR4, RREB1, ADAR).  
   Together with GO enrichment, this points to regulation of retinal neuroepithelial maturation, cell-cycle exit, and the first wave of retinal ganglion-cell / amacrine specification.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif & gene overlap)  
   • Eye-field / retina: Rx (Rax), Otx1/2, Crx, Vsx1, Pax6, Six3/6, Lhx2, Dmbx1, Homeobox (Hox-free eye factors).  
   • Neurogenic bHLH / Sox support: Sox2/3/11, Neurog/Ascl, bHLHE22/23.  
   • Cell-cycle–exit modulators: E2F1/2/3/7/8, FoxM1 motifs.  
   • Circadian/ARNT-bHLH (Clock/Arntl, Tfe/Tfec) motifs—consistent with photoreceptor and metabolic priming.

In summary, cluster 13_13 marks cis-regulatory regions that switch on specifically in optic-cup cells during the 20-24 hpf window, driving the transcriptional programme that converts proliferative retinal neuroepithelium into early differentiated neuronal subtypes.
]

## Cluster 13_14

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 13_14 captures the cis-regulatory program that turns on when the zebrafish notochord finishes morphogenesis and starts to lay down its collagen-rich sheath late in segmentation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is fairly uniform (≈ 40 AU) from gastrulation up to ∼20-somite stage, then shows a dramatic jump at 30 somites/24 hpf (notochord_30 somites = 305 AU; 7–8-fold above baseline).  
   • This timing coincides with the well-described wave of extracellular-matrix (ECM) production and final patterning of the axial midline just before the embryo begins to bend and hatch.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • The spike is overwhelmingly confined to the notochord; all other cell types remain near baseline.  
   • Modest secondary enrichment (~1.2×) is seen in other midline derivatives (neural floor plate, midbrain–hindbrain boundary) and cranio-pharyngeal mesoderm, fitting their shared FOX/Hox usage.

3. Regulatory program inferred from linked genes  
   Enriched gene set mirrors late notochord physiology and A-P patterning:  
   – Structural/ECM: col2a1a, col11a1a, col12a1b, col5a3b, mmp11a, mmp14a, tll1.  
   – Signalling & patterning: ihhb (Shh ligand homologue), fgf18a, sulf2a/b, nog1, wnt ligands/inhibitors.  
   – A-P identity and maturation: dense array of Hox (a/b/c/d) genes, meis/pbx cofactors, runx, pax, dmrt.  
   – Classic notochord TFs/markers: noto, foxa2/3, ta (brachyury), tbx16, sox5/6/9 set.

   Together these point to a module that drives ECM assembly, midline sonic-hedgehog signalling and Hox-coded regionalisation of the notochord.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
   • FOX family (FOXA2/3, FOXF1/2) – highest motif scores; pioneers opening notochord enhancers.  
   • Brachyury/T (ta) & TBX16 – T-box motifs present; required for notochord fate and sheath gene activation.  
   • SOX5/6/9 “cartilage trio” – motifs abundant; activate collagen genes.  
   • HOX/MEIS/PBX cluster – strong motif block specifying axial position.  
   • DLX/EVX/MSX & PAX2/3/7 – patterning cofactors echoed in motif table.  
   • E2F/FOXM1 signatures likely reflect the burst of end-of-cycle proliferation just before terminal differentiation.

In summary, peak-cluster 13_14 represents a late-segmentation notochord enhancer set, opened by FOX/TBX/Brachyury pioneers, modulated by HOX/MEIS positional factors and SOX cartilage regulators, to drive ECM deposition and final axial patterning of the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 13_15

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 13_15 corresponds to a large set of regulatory elements that light up during the window when the embryo is laying down the nervous system and associated cranio-facial structures.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at gastrulation/0-somite stage and rises further through the segmentation period (≈5–20 somites, 11–18 hpf).  
   • By 30 somites (≈24 hpf) it remains high in neural derivatives but drops sharply in mesodermal progenitors (NMP, PSM, epidermis), indicating a switch from broad progenitor use to neural-restricted use.

2. Cell-type specificity (top accessible pseudobulks)  
   • Neuroectoderm & early neurons – hindbrain, midbrain–hindbrain boundary, spinal cord, floor plate, differentiating neurons.  
   • Sensory organ primordia – optic cup/retina, cranial neural crest–derived territories.  
   • Moderate signal in endoderm-derived pancreas and heart; low in late PSM, epidermis.  
   • An isolated very high signal in the optic-cup sample (data spike) is consistent with the strong eye/forebrain signature.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Enriched genes and motifs point to pathways that pattern and mature the nervous system:  
   • A-P and D-V neural patterning – Wnt1/9a, Fgf10, multiple Hox, Dlx, Irx, Pbx, Meis, Lhx, Pax, Sox and Fox family genes.  
   • Axon guidance / synaptogenesis – EphA/B, Semaphorin-4/6, Slit, Robo, Tenm, Rims, Ryr2, ion-channel and adhesion genes (Cadm, Cdh, Cntn).  
   • Sensory-organ specification – genes for optic cup/retina (nr2e3, crx, otx, vsx, six6/7) and ear/craniofacial crest.  
   • RA / steroid / nuclear-receptor signalling (RAR/RXR/NR2F, COUP-TFs) and chromatin regulators (Kdm2, Dnmt1) suggest integration of morphogen and epigenetic cues.

4. Likely driver transcription factors (motifs & gene correlations)  
   • Homeobox network: Hox paralog groups 1-13, Dlx1/2/5/6, Lhx1/2/9, Pbx/Meis co-factors – establish positional identity.  
   • Pax6/3/7 and Irx1/3/5 – regionalisation of fore-/mid-/hind-brain and neural crest.  
   • SoxB (Sox2/3/11) and Fox (FoxG1, FoxD1/3, FoxP, FoxC/F) – neural stem-cell maintenance and differentiation.  
   • RA/nuclear receptors (Rara/b/g, Rxra/b, Nr2f1/2/6) – retinoid response elements that time A-P patterning.  
   • E-box & bHLH factors (NeuroD, Atoh1/7, Olig2, Tcf12) – neuronal lineage commitment.  
   • Chromatin/cell-cycle modulators (E2F1-8, Kdm2, Mef2 family) – coupling proliferation with fate acquisition.

In sum, peak-cluster 13_15 marks a core regulatory module that is switched on during segmentation to orchestrate regional patterning and early differentiation of the vertebrate nervous system—especially forebrain/optic and hindbrain–spinal regions—via a Homeobox/Pax/Fox/Sox-dominated transcriptional programme modulated by retinoic-acid signalling.
]

## Cluster 13_16

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 13_16 corresponds to an early neuro-ectoderm / eye-field promoter–enhancer program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at the first profiled stage (0-somite ≈10 hpf), peaks between 0- and 5-somites (≈10–12 hpf), and then progressively diminishes through 30-somites (24 hpf).  
   • The fall-off is visible in all enriched cell types (e.g. optic-cup: 8.8 → 6.2; floor-plate: 7.3 → 5.2; neural-optic: 7.4 → 5.4).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Optic/eye field derivatives: optic-cup and “neural-optic” fractions at 0- and 5-somites are the strongest signal.  
   • Midline neural tissue: floor-plate and tail-bud midline cells.  
   • Early differentiating neurons (incl. enteric neurons 15-/30-somites) show secondary enrichment.  
   • Mesodermal, epidermal, endodermal or muscle pseudobulks remain near baseline (≈5–6).

3. Likely biological processes regulated  
   • Specification of the anterior neuro-ectoderm and eye field (patterning, neurulation, optic-cup morphogenesis).  
   • Early neuronal differentiation / axonogenesis.  
   • Retinoic-acid and Hedgehog response elements (presence of many RAR/RXR and PTCH1/SUFU-linked genes) suggest coupling to rostro-caudal patterning cues.  
   • Gene list is dominated by broadly expressed but neuro-biased loci (e.g. CRX, RFX2, VSX1, SIX family motifs; cell-adhesion/ECM genes ADAM12, COL4A3, CNTN-, CTNN-, etc.) that are required for neuroepithelial polarity and retinal lamination.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
   • Eye-field / retinal TFs: Rx/Rax (rx1/2/3), Crx, Otx1/2/5, Six3/6/7, Vsx1/2, Lhx2/9.  
   • Master forebrain factor Pax6 (motifs and Pax6-positive peaks).  
   • Homeobox co-factors Pbx/Meis and Barhl/Dlx that cooperate in retinal ganglion and interneuron lineages.  
   • RA-nuclear-receptor family (Rarg/a, Rxra/b), linking the cluster to retinoid signalling.  
   • CXXC/Kdm2b-bound CpG-island motif (unique “direct” hit) indicates many peaks lie at unmethylated promoters and may recruit Polycomb/TrxG machinery early.  
   • Supplementary inputs from Sox (neuro-ectoderm), Fox, E2F and Klf/Sp families support a proliferative neuroepithelial context.

In summary, peak-cluster 13_16 marks promoters/enhancers that open very early in the eye-field / anterior neural plate, stay accessible in midline‐neural and early neuronal derivatives, and are controlled by the classic retinal gene-regulatory network (Rx/Six/Otx/Pax6/Crx) together with RA-receptors and general CpG-island binders such as Kdm2b.
]

## Cluster 13_17

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 13_17 marks a set of regulatory elements that “switch on” late in somitogenesis and are almost exclusively opened in the emerging retina.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is low and flat (≈3–4 a.u.) from gastrulation through 20-somite stages, then rises sharply at 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
• The jump is >70-fold in optic-cup nuclei (optic_cup_30 somites ≈ 270) and ~7-fold in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM_30 somites ≈ 26), indicating a late-somite/early-organogenesis activation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is seen in:  
• Optic cup / retinal neuroepithelium → dominant signal.  
• Minor but measurable opening in late PSM and maturing somites; virtually baseline in all other lineages.  
Thus the cluster is retina-biased, with weak spill-over to mesoderm that may reflect shared motif usage rather than function.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
Enriched gene set is packed with retina/neuronal differentiation factors and photoreceptor structural genes:  
• Eye-field/photoreceptor TFs: six7, rorb, crx, pitx2/3, otx1/2, barhl, pax6.  
• Synaptic and axon-guidance molecules: nrxn2/3, cntnap2a, ctnna2, dscama, agrn, grid2, cadpsa, bsnb.  
• Photoreceptor/RPE structural & disease genes: ush2a, vstm2a, smoc2, smyd1a, ush2a.  
• Neuro-transmission & signalling: gabrb1, glra1, tph2, ntrk1/3, oprk1.  
Together these point to a programme that drives terminal differentiation of retinal neurons—especially photoreceptors—and assembly of their synaptic machinery.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched in the cluster)  
• SIX / sine-oculis family: Six6, Six7, Six3/4 – master regulators of photoreceptor gene batteries.  
• OTX/CRX homeobox group (Otx1/2, Crx, Dmbx1) – activate phototransduction genes.  
• PAX6 & related paired box factors – retinal progenitor competence.  
• Nuclear receptors linked to photoreceptor subtype choice: RORβ (rorb), NR2E3, RXRs/RARs.  
• Onecut (Oc1/2/3) & LHX/Barhl families – retinal interneuron lineage factors.  
• Maf/Nrl axis (mafab, nrl, mafk) – rod vs cone fate specification.  
The concurrence of these motifs with the gene set and optic-cup-restricted accessibility strongly argues that SIX–OTX/CRX–PAX6–ROR modules are the primary regulators opening this peak cluster.

Summary  
Peak cluster 13_17 is a retina-specific, late-somite enhancer set that becomes highly accessible as optic-cup cells exit the progenitor state and begin photoreceptor and retinal neuron differentiation. It is driven by SIX, OTX/CRX, PAX6 and nuclear-receptor TFs and coordinates expression of adhesion, synaptic and phototransduction genes necessary for functional retinal neuron development.

## Cluster 13_18

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 13_18 – summary interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises with the onset of segmentation (≈5-20-somite stages, 11-19 hpf) and is already moderate in gastrula NMPs.  
• In most paraxial-mesoderm derivatives (PSM, early somites, fast-muscle buds) accessibility drops again by 30 somites (≈24 hpf), whereas neural derivatives keep it high, indicating a switch from mesodermal to neural usage as trunk development matures.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest values)  
• Neuromesodermal progenitors → presomitic mesoderm → forming somites / fast muscle  
• Trunk neural lineages: differentiating spinal neurons, spinal cord, floor plate, hind-/mid-brain neurons  
• Supporting midline tissues: notochord, tail-bud  
(Endoderm, epidermis, pancreas etc. show only basal accessibility.)

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
The gene set is dominated by:  
• Numerous clustered Hox genes (hoxa4-a11, hoxb1-b10, hoxc3-c13, hoxd3-d12) plus Pbx / Meis cofactors → confers positional identity along the mid-posterior axis.  
• Pax3/7, Lbx1, MyoD/Mef2, Ryr1a, Tnni2a, Neb, Xirp1/2 → early myogenic and muscle-structuring programme.  
• Lhx, Uncx, Phox2, Runx3, Robo3, Ntrk3, Grik/Grin genes → specification of spinal cord neurons (dorsal interneurons, motor-neurons, visceral neurons).  
• Large set of ECM and guidance molecules (Col14a1, Tnc, Tenm2, Spon1/2, Adamts2/3, Agrn) → matrix remodelling and axon/muscle fibre path-finding during trunk elongation.  
→ Altogether the cluster marks the trunk segmentation module that coordinates anterior–posterior patterning, somitic myogenesis and concurrent spinal-cord neuronal differentiation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + expressed factors in cluster)  
• HOX paralog groups 4-10 together with Pbx1/3/4 and Meis1/2/3 – core A-P patterning code.  
• Nkx1.2 / Nkx2 family and T-box factors (T, Tbx6/Tbx16) – neuromesodermal and PSM identity.  
• Pax3, Pax7, Lbx1, Myf5/MyoD and Mef2 (Mef2a/b/c/d) – myogenic initiation in nascent somites.  
• Lhx2/4/9, Phox2a/b, Uncx, Runx3 – specification of dorsal interneurons and lateral motor-column neurons.  
• Sox2/3/5 and Fox (Foxa/Foxd/Foxg) factors – keep axial progenitors and early neural progenitors competent.  
• RA-responsive nuclear receptors (Rara/b, Rxr, Nr2f1/2) – consistent with RA-mediated trunk Hox activation.

Taken together, peak-cluster 13_18 captures the cis-regulatory landscape that is opened during trunk elongation to implement the HOX-directed positional programme and to launch parallel myogenic and neurogenic differentiation of the emerging mid-posterior body.

## Cluster 14_0

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 14_0 marks a regulatory program that “switches on” in the middle of somitogenesis, first in paraxial-mesodermal tissues and later in trunk endoderm and early gut derivatives.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Modest accessibility at 0–5 somites (10–12 hpf)  
• Sharp peak at 10–15 somites (≈14–18 hpf) – the height of segmentation; somite signals reach 21–22 a.u.  
• Persists, but gradually shifts, into 20–30 somites (≈20–24 hpf) where the strongest signal is now in fore-/mid-gut endoderm (endoderm 20 & 30 somites = 15 a.u.) and endocrine pancreas.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Paraxial mesoderm / forming somites  
• Trunk endoderm (future fore-/mid-gut) and endocrine-pancreas progenitors  
• Moderate signal in early heart, hemangioblasts and enteric-neural crest, in keeping with shared mesendodermal origin.

3. Biological processes inferred  
• Somitogenesis and anterior-posterior (A–P) patterning – presence of many Hox, Tbx16/Ta (brachyury), Mesp, Ripply-like, Wnt9a, Fgf-receptor (fgfr1a) and Notch modulators (rspо2, her genes).  
• Transition of trunk mesoderm to myogenic and vasculogenic fates (vegfaa, itga5, mef2, myod, myf5 motifs).  
• Early gut tube and pancreatic primordium specification (foxa1/2/3, hnf1ba/b, gata4/5/6, pdx1; high accessibility in endoderm & endocrine-pancreas pseudobulks).  
Overall, cluster 14_0 appears to couple the segmentation “clock & wavefront” network with emerging visceral endoderm programs, aligning trunk patterning with organogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (highly enriched motifs & expressed genes)  
• Tbx / Brachyury family – Tbx16, Ta: master regulators of paraxial mesoderm and Wnt-FGF segmentation signal.  
• Hox paralogs (Hoxb1-b7, Hoxc6/9/13, Hoxd4/9) – A–P positional identity of somites and gut.  
• Mesp-related (mespab, mespaa) and Ripply partners – segmentation clock output.  
• Fox factors – Foxa1/2/3, Foxf2, Foxd1/3/5 – opening gut and lateral mesoderm enhancers.  
• Gata (Gata4/5/6) and Hnf1b – driving hepatic/pancreatic endoderm.  
• Mef2 / Myod / Myf5 – initiation of myogenic program within maturing somites.  
• RAR/RXR and Nr2f (COUP-TF) nuclear-receptor motifs – consistent with retinoic-acid control of trunk patterning and pancreas induction.

In summary, peak cluster 14_0 delineates enhancers that are transiently activated during mid-segmentation to pattern trunk mesoderm, then remain open in endoderm as gut and pancreatic lineages emerge, orchestrated by a TF ensemble centered on Tbx/Bra, Hox, Fox, Gata/Hnf and RA-responsive nuclear receptors.

## Cluster 14_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 14_1 captures a transcriptional program that turns on as gastrulation ends and spear-heads early organogenesis of lateral-plate derivatives (heart & vasculature) together with fore-gut endoderm (liver / pancreas).

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest at 0–5 somites (10–12 hpf), rises sharply by 10–15 somites (≈14–17 hpf) – the stage when the heart field is specifying and endothelial/endoderm progenitors expand – and then remains high through 20–30 somites (20–24 hpf) in endoderm-derived cells, while gradually declining in the myocardium.  

2. Cell-type specificity (highest average accessibility)  
• Heart-myocardium (peak values 42–44)  
• Fore-gut endoderm & endocrine pancreas (~12–17)  
• Hemangioblast / hematopoietic-vasculature (early high, 21→7)  
• Pharyngeal-/lateral-plate mesoderm & arch mesenchyme (10–35)  
Background cell types (NMPs, neural, muscle, epidermis) stay low (~5–7).

3. Biological processes likely regulated  
• Cardiac morphogenesis and sarcomere assembly – tnnt2a, tnni1b, myh7l, myl7, ryr2b, hcn4, hand2, isl1, tbx5a/20, mef2c.  
• Vascular / hemangioblast specification – kdrl, flt4, nrp1, tal1, etv2/fli1, runx1.  
• Fore-gut endoderm & pancreatic primordium – foxa1/3, gata4/5/6, dab2, pdzd4, pdx-like genes, ptf1a.  
• Extracellular-matrix & EMT needed for heart tube/arch remodeling – tnc, col4a2, lama1, adamts, mmp11.  
• Retinoic-acid and RA/COUP-TF signalling (rarga/b, nr2f1/2, rxr, hnf4) that pattern anterior LPM & fore-gut.  

4. Key enriched transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment and co-expressed genes point to:  
• GATA family – Gata4/5/6 (heart & endoderm competence)  
• T-box factors – Tbx5a, Tbx20 (cardiac chamber formation)  
• Hand2 & Nkx2.5/2-group (cardiac/LPM specification)  
• MEF2 family (sarcomere gene activation)  
• ETS factors Etv2 / Fli1 / Erg (endothelial & hemangioblast programme)  
• FOXA / FOXF / FOXC (fore-gut endoderm, vascular smooth muscle)  
• Nuclear-receptor cluster (RA-receptors, NR2F/COUP-TF, HNF4) coordinating RA and metabolic maturation.  

Together, peak-cluster 14_1 marks the cis-regulatory landscape that coordinates early heart, vessel and fore-gut organogenesis during 14–24 hpf zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 14_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 14_2 captures an endoderm/posterior-axis enhancer program that turns on at mid-somitogenesis and remains high through early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility starts to rise around the 5-somite stage, peaks at 10-15 somites, and stays high to 30 somites.  
   • This is evident from tail-bud (5 → 15 somites: 4.7 → 11.3) and endoderm (10 → 30 somites: 4.6 → 6.5) pseudobulks.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Tail-bud progenitors (posterior growth zone).  
   • Definitive endoderm and its derivatives – gut tube, emerging endocrine-pancreas, early liver-/intestinal epithelium.  
   • Secondary but reproducible signal in heart myocardium and posterior NMPs.

3. Biological programme represented  
   • Posterior gut-tube extension and patterning.  
   • Onset of organ-specific endoderm gene batteries (intestinal/liver metabolic genes, pancreas endocrine programme).  
   • Transition of axial progenitors into posterior endoderm (tail-bud → gut).  
   Enriched gene set reinforces this: hnf4a/hnf4g, hnf1ba/bb, gata4/5/6, foxa1/2/3, pdx1, ptf1a, cdx1/4, wt1a/b, rarb/rar targets, many solute-carriers and metabolic enzymes (acss2, abca1a, slc4/9 family).

4. Likely driver transcription factors  
   Motif enrichment together with the expressed factors point to:  
   • Endoderm/visceral organ TFs: FoxA (foxa1/2/3), GATA (gata4/5/6), HNF (hnf4a/g, hnf1ba/bb), SOX17/SOX18, Cdx1/4.  
   • Nuclear-receptor metabolic regulators: HNF4, COUP-TF (NR2F1/2/6), RAR/RXR, PPARα/γ.  
   • Circadian & bHLH-Zip factors tied to metabolic maturation: Bach1/2, Arntl/Clock, Srebf1/2, Tfe3/Tfeb/Tfec.  
   • Posterior axial/tail-bud factors: Tbx (tbx2/3/16/18), Cdx, and lower-level Wnt/β-catenin (Tcf7/Lef1 motifs present).

Together these data indicate that peak-cluster 14_2 marks cis-regulatory elements that coordinate posterior body elongation with maturation of endodermal derivatives, priming the embryonic gut, liver and endocrine pancreas between 10 and 24 hpf.
]

## Cluster 14_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 14_3 represents an “organ-bud / trunk endoderm + paraxial-mesoderm” regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility starts already at 0-somite (≈10 hpf) but rises steadily, reaching its maximum at 20–30 somites (≈22–24 hpf).  
   • The monotonic increase in endoderm (34 → 49 a.u.) and the transient mid-peak in mature somites (26 → 37 a.u. at 10 somites) indicate continuing activation through early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest pseudobulk values)  
   • Definitive endoderm / gut tube: all stages, strongest at 15–30 somites.  
   • Differentiating paraxial mesoderm (maturing somites).  
   • Secondary but lower in NMPs, PSM and notochord; low in neural/neural-crest lineages.

3. Inferred biological programme  
   Genes linked to the cluster (Hnf1ba/b, Hnf4g, Gata4/5/6-targets, Lamc1, Col6a3, Fn1b, Angpt4, Tgfbr3, Stat3, Abca/Abcc family, Ext1b, Grem2a, Bmp7b) point to:  
   • Epithelial maturation and basement-membrane assembly of the gut and associated buds (liver, pancreas).  
   • Initiation of organ-specific metabolic and transporter functions.  
   • Concurrent patterning and extracellular-matrix remodelling in trunk somites (laminin/col6, Mmp15a, Fn1b).  
   • Integration of Wnt / BMP / Hippo signalling (Tcf7l2, Ror1, Gdf6a, Bmp7b, Tead/Yes motifs).

4. Key transcription factors (motifs & gene co-expression)  
   • Endoderm pioneer/organ TFs: FOXA1/2/3, FOXL1/2, HNF1B, HNF4 (strong FOX/HNF motif scores, presence of hnf1ba/b & hnf4g RNA).  
   • GATA4/5/6 – classical gut‐tube enhancers (GATA motif enrichment, gata genes expressed).  
   • TCF7L2 / LEF1 – Wnt-responsive regulation of intestinal progenitors.  
   • MEF2 / TBX (MEF2, TBX motifs) – drive early myogenic / somite peak.  
   • STAT3 and TEAD1/3 (moderate motifs, stat3 correlation) – link inflammatory–Hippo inputs during budding.

Together these observations argue that peak-cluster 14_3 marks enhancers that become increasingly open as trunk endoderm matures and as paraxial mesoderm transitions into differentiated somites, orchestrated chiefly by FOX/HNF/GATA factors with Wnt-TCF reinforcement.
]

## Cluster 14_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 14_4 captures the chromatin program of the nascent heart field and differentiating myocardium.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises sharply after gastrulation, peaks between 10-20 somites (≈14-20 hpf), and tapers by 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • This timing coincides with cardiac progenitor specification, heart-tube formation and the onset of chamber-specific gene expression.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Heart myocardium shows by far the strongest signal (log-accessibility ≈7 → 17 across 0-20 somites).  
   • Moderate accessibility is seen in lateral-plate mesoderm derivatives (hemangioblast/vasculature) and fore-gut endoderm / endocrine-pancreas, consistent with their common origin with cardiac mesoderm.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Structural/contractile module – myh6, myh7, myh7l, tnni1b, tnnc1a, tmod1, ldb3b, ryr2, hcn4 → sarcomere assembly, calcium handling, pacemaker activity.  
   • Cardiac mesoderm/heart-field genes – gata5/6, pdgfra, wnt2bb, wnt6b, ccbe1, nrg1, hand2, nkx2 family → heart-tube morphogenesis, chamber patterning.  
   • Extracellular-matrix & EMT genes (col12/15/6, itga11, flt4, flnca/b, pdlim4) → myocardial compaction and interaction with endocardium.  
   Overall, the cluster represents the transition from cardiac progenitor to early functional cardiomyocyte.

4. Key transcription factors (motifs strongly enriched)  
   • GATA family – Gata5/6: initiates cardiac/endoderm programme.  
   • NKX2 family – Nkx2.5/2.7: core cardiac specification factor.  
   • TBX factors – Tbx5a/b, Tbx20, Tbx2/3: chamber identity, heart-tube elongation.  
   • MEF2 family – Mef2aa/ca/cb/d: activates contractile and metabolic genes.  
   • HAND/HLH factors – Hand2, Tcf21/Bhlhe23: ventricular and pro-epicardial lineages.  
   • COUP-TF / NR2F and SRF-Myocardin cofactors (Srf, Mrtfb) are also enriched, supporting atrial identity and cytoskeletal gene activation.

Taken together, peak-cluster 14_4 demarcates enhancers driving early zebrafish cardiogenesis, becoming most accessible during heart-field specification (10-20 somites) and predominantly active in developing myocardium.
]

## Cluster 14_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 14_5 captures an endoderm-centred regulatory program that later becomes strongly biased toward the nascent endocrine pancreas.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessible already at 0-somite stage (10 hpf) but rises steeply over time.  
   • Endoderm pseudobulks climb from ~26 (0 s) to ~79 (30 s).  
   • Endocrine-pancreas pseudobulks rise from ~29 (0 s) to ~58 (30 s).  
   • Notochord and hatching-gland show early but more transient accessibility.  
   ⇒ Peak activity is between 20–30 somites (≈ 22–24 hpf), i.e. during early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Definitive endoderm (gut tube)  
   • Endocrine pancreas anlage/Islet lineage  
   • Hatching-gland (sub-set of anterior endoderm)  
   • Notochord (midline Foxa2+ tissue; high at 0–10 s)  
   Other germ layers show only baseline (~4–7) values.

3. Likely biological processes/pathways  
   • Endoderm specification and epithelial maturation (foxa2, sox17, gata5/6, hhex, onecut, hnf1/4).  
   • Pancreatic endocrine commitment, hormone-secretion machinery (rfx6, pdx1-linked network, slc2a2, aqp7, dpp4).  
   • Metabolic and absorptive programs for developing gut/liver (apoa2, col15a1b, transporters abcb4, abcc4, slc family, cytochrome genes).  
   • Midline signalling (shha, ihha) underpinning notochord patterning.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene list)  
   Pioneer/lineage TFs  
   • FOX family: Foxa1/2/3, Foxf1/2, Foxl1 – classic endoderm/notochord pioneers.  
   • GATA factors: Gata4/5/6 – drive fore-/mid-gut and pancreas programs.  
   • SOX17/18 (+ Sox6/9) – endoderm competence.  
   Pancreatic/endocrine TFs  
   • RFX6, ONECUT1/2/3, HNF1ba/bb, HNF4a/b/g – endocrine-pancreas and hepatic fate.  
   • NR5A2 (LRH-1), PPAR, ROR nuclear-receptor motifs – metabolic / lipid-handling genes.  
   Additional contributors  
   • TBX (Tbx2/3/5/20) & DMRT for gut looping/organ positioning.  
   • MEF2 & SRF motifs hint at emerging contractile/secretory specialisation.  

Together, cluster 14_5 marks chromatin regions that open first in broadly Foxa2+/Gata+ endoderm and notochord, then become most accessible in endocrine-pancreatic precursors, coordinating transcriptional programs required for gut tube maturation and endocrine pancreas differentiation during 12–24 hpf zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 14_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 14_6 captures a “trunk/viscera” regulatory module that turns on during mid-segmentation and is reused in multiple endoderm- and paraxial-derived lineages.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest at gastrula/0-somite, rises sharply between 5-15 somites, and stays high into late segmentation (20-30 somites) in endodermal derivatives.  
• Highest stage-specific peaks:  
  – 10–15 somites in somites (39–38 a.u.) and notochord (≈30 a.u.)  
  – 20–30 somites in gut endoderm (35–40 a.u.) and endocrine-pancreas (20–23 a.u.).

2. Cell-type specificity (top accessibility values)  
• Gut/foregut endoderm & early digestive organs (endoderm cluster, endocrine-pancreas)  
• Paraxial mesoderm – maturing somites/future skeletal muscle  
• Axial mesoderm – notochord  
• Hemangioblasts and optic cup show an early, transient pulse.

3. Implied biological programme  
Gene set is enriched for epithelial / organ-primordia genes (hnf1ba/b, hnf1bb, foxa/foxf, onecut2, gata4/5/6, cdh17, cldn2, col12a1, tnc, igfbp3/5, vcana) plus somitic ECM/adhesion genes (lama2, lama5, tnfrsf21).  Together with the temporal pattern the cluster most likely contains cis-elements that:  
• Drive gut-tube maturation and budding of pancreas, liver, pronephros  
• Maintain notochord sheath/ECM production  
• Pattern trunk somites and early myotome.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs with highest z-scores & mapping)  
• Forkhead/FOX family (FOXA1/2/3, FOXF1/F2, FOXD3/D5) – classic pioneers for endoderm and paraxial mesoderm enhancers.  
• HNF network (HNF1B, HNF4A/G) – gut-tube epithelial differentiation.  
• ONECUT1/2 and GATA4/5/6 – foregut, pancreas, liver.  
• HOX / PBX / MEIS—antero-posterior trunk patterning in somites and notochord.  
• SOX17/18 and SOX9 – endodermal competence and pancreatic duct programme.  
• E2F / KDM2 / FOXM1 motifs present but lower, consistent with proliferative state of these progenitors.

In sum, cluster 14_6 marks enhancers that become accessible as the trunk endoderm, notochord and somites mature, under control of FOX–GATA–HNF/ONECUT–HOX transcription-factor combinations.
]

## Cluster 14_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 14_7 marks the regulatory landscape that progressively opens as internal organs begin to differentiate.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • First detectable at late gastrulation/0–5-som stages, but accessibility keeps climbing through somitogenesis.  
   • It reaches its global maximum during early organogenesis (10–20 som; ≈15–19 hpf), especially in developing heart and gut.  
   • A transient spike at 5 som in primordial germ cells is seen but is short-lived.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Endoderm-derived epithelia: definitive endoderm, endocrine pancreas, nascent intestine/kidney.  
   • Cardiac mesoderm: heart myocardium (10–15 som).  
   • One brief, very high pulse in primordial germ cells at 5 som (likely reflecting a short window of broad chromatin de-compaction).  

3. Regulatory program inferred  
   • Genes in the cluster encode epithelial-junction/ECM components (CDH18, COL15A1, MMP11), solute and lipid transporters (SLC5A1, SLC26A6, SLCO3A1, ABCA4), metabolic regulators (HNF4G, PPARGC1A, GSK3AB), and secretory-pathway factors (FURINA, PCLO, PLPPR5).  
   • GO/process implication: maturation of gut and pancreatic epithelium, onset of nutrient absorption and lipid/ion homeostasis, and metabolic up-shift in the embryonic heart.  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched and/or genes present)  
   • Hepatic/intestinal nuclear receptors: Hnf4 (HNF4G), Rxr/Rar, Ppar, Ror family – integrate metabolic cues.  
   • Endoderm/epithelial pioneers: Foxa (foxa1/2/3 motifs), Hnf1b (gene present), Gata4/6.  
   • Grainy-head factors (Grhl2b) – epithelial barrier formation.  
   • C/EBP and Creb/Atf family – support secretory/matrix gene expression.  
   • Cardiac TBX5/TBX20 and GATA interplay likely accounts for the myocardium peak.  

Together, cluster 14_7 represents a metabolic/epithelial endoderm-heart module that becomes increasingly accessible from mid-somitogenesis onward, driving the gene programs required for gut, pancreas, kidney and heart functional maturation.
]

## Cluster 14_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 14_8 marks a “late-endoderm / visceral-organ” chromatin programme that turns on during mid-to-late segmentation and is shared by endoderm-derived organs and nascent myocardium.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at 0–5-somite stages and rises steadily thereafter, peaking between 15- to 30-somites (≈ 18–24 hpf).  
   • The clearest monotonic increase is seen in the endoderm series (0 s: 3.4  →  30 s: 6.1), with similar late surges in endocrine-pancreas and heart pseudobulks.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest average accessibility)  
   • Definitive endoderm / gut tube  
   • Endocrine-pancreas progenitors  
   • Developing myocardium (heart-myocardium 10–20 s)  
   • Moderate signal in hemangioblast / vasculature and skeletal-muscle anlagen

3. Biological programme represented  
   • Visceral-organ morphogenesis and metabolic maturation – genes include Pdx1/Glis3 (pancreas), Hnf4a/haao/gss/ugp2b (hepato-intestinal metabolism), Stat5a/Met/Bmp16 (growth & cytokine signalling), Casr/Slc transporters (ion & nutrient handling) and contractile/Excitation genes ryr1a, cacna1eb (muscle/heart).  
   • Concurrent cardiomyocyte differentiation (Mef2aa, Tmod2, Ky, Ryr1a).  
   • Overall the cluster links late endodermal differentiation with functional specialisation of gut, pancreas and early heart.

4. Likely key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene co-expression)  
   Endoderm / gut: FOX (Foxa1/2/3, Foxl1/2, Foxp1/2/4), GATA4/6, HNF4 (Hnf4a/g), NR2F “COUP-TFs”, RAR/RXR nuclear-receptor pair, Pdx1, Onecut family, RFX3/6.  
   Pancreas-specific maturation: Pdx1, Rfx6, Glis3, Stat5a.  
   Heart / muscle branch: MEF2 (Mef2aa/ab/cb/d), SRF, TEAD1/3, TBX5/20, NKX2-5 (motifs present, genes expressed).  
   General stress & metabolic regulators: ATF/CREB, NRF (Nfe2l), Bach/MAF family.

In summary, cluster 14_8 represents chromatin regions that become accessible as zebrafish embryos transition from generic endoderm to fully committed digestive-organ and cardiac lineages, orchestrated by canonical endodermal (FOXA/GATA/HNF/Pdx1) and cardiometabolic (MEF2/NR/Stat5) transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 15_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15_0 marks the switch from somitic progenitors to fully differentiated skeletal muscle.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest from 0-20-somite stages, but jumps dramatically at 30-somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • The spike is most obvious in presomitic mesoderm (PSM_30 somites ≈ 27.6) and bulk “muscle” (muscle_30 somites ≈ 46.2) while earlier time-points stay near baseline (~2).  
   → The cluster therefore corresponds to the late segmentation / early organogenesis window when myofibres assemble and begin contraction.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility in:  
   • Differentiated trunk/fast muscle populations (muscle_30 somites, fast-muscle_30 somites)  
   • Mature posterior somites / PSM at 30 somites  
   • Secondary enrichment in generic somites; very low in neural/endodermal lineages.  
   → The pattern is muscle-restricted rather than neural, endodermal or NMP.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Gene set is packed with muscle structural and functional components:  
   • Sarcomere / costamere: ttn, sgcd, sgcg, casq1b, casp9, plpp2a, prkg1b  
   • Excitation-contraction coupling: cacna1da/eb/ia, hpca, kcnh5a, kcnn3  
   • ECM / tendon linkage: fmodb, frem2a, fndc3b, smoc2, spock2  
   • Neuromuscular junction & signalling: rapsn, igrbp2b, fgf13a, igfbp2b, rapsn, prss12  
   • Metabolic/AMPK module: prkag1, ndrg3b, gfpt1  
   Together they define late myofibre assembly, calcium handling and NMJ maturation.

4. Likely driving transcription factors  
   Motif enrichment and TF-mapping highlight the canonical myogenic cascade:  
   • bHLH myogenic regulators: MyoD (myod1), Myf5/6, Myogenin (myog), Msc; supported by E-box partners Tcf3/Tcf12.  
   • Mef2 family (mef2a/b/c/d) – activates contractile-gene batteries.  
   • SRF (srfa/b) and TEAD1/3 (Hippo–Yap pathway) – act on cytoskeleton/actin genes during fibre maturation.  
   • FoxO / FoxK / FoxP and Runx factors appear as modulators of muscle metabolism and fibre-type choice.  
   • Minor but consistent presence of Twist/Tcf21 motifs fits connective-tissue interface genes (fmod, frem2).

Summary: Peak-cluster 15_0 is a late-stage, muscle-specific regulatory module that turns on at the 30-somite stage to drive sarcomere assembly, excitation-contraction machinery and neuromuscular-junction genes under the control of MyoD–Mef2–SRF/TEAD-centred transcriptional circuitry.
]

## Cluster 15_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15_1 is a very large set of peaks that becomes accessible in most tissues as the embryo exits segmentation and enters early organogenesis, but it shows a pronounced late-stage “burst” in the somitic/muscle compartment.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Little or no accessibility at the 0-somite stage.  
• Gradually rising signal from 5- to 20-somites.  
• Maximal activity at 30-somites (~24 hpf), with a >10-fold jump in the “muscle_30somites” pseudobulk sample.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• Broadly accessible (PSM, differentiating neurons, endoderm, epidermis, etc. all around the baseline ~3).  
• Highest accessibility is in paraxial/mature trunk muscle (bulk “muscle” and fast-muscle at 20–30 somites).  
• Secondary enrichment in late-stage neural populations (hindbrain / spinal cord) and lateral-plate mesoderm.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
The gene list is dominated by:  
• Structural / contractile and metabolic muscle genes (actn1/3, myh7bb, tmod1, lama2, col6a1, etc.)  
• Axon-guidance / synaptic genes (cntn, nrxn, slc17a, grin, robo, unc5, ryr, cacna, kcnh, grm, kcnq, etc.)  
• Homeobox and patterning TFs (Hox, Lhx, Dlx, Pax, Six, Irx)  
• General growth-and-metabolism factors (E2F, Klf/SP, Srebf, Nrf, Fox, Sox)  

Taken together, the cluster appears to mark promoter-proximal regulatory regions that switch on the broad differentiation programme required for tissue maturation after somitogenesis, with an especially strong myogenic component.

4. Key transcription-factor signatures  
Motif enrichment points to several cooperating TF groups:  
• Myogenic drivers – MyoD/MyoG/MYF5, MEF2 family, SRF → explain the muscle-specific spike.  
• Neural differentiation bHLH factors – NeuroD, Atoh, Olig2.  
• Broad developmental regulators – Sox (Sox2/3/10/11), Fox (FoxK/FoxD/FoxG), Hox / Pbx / Meis, Tcf/Lef (Wnt feedback).  
• Cell-cycle / housekeeping promoters – E2F1-4/7, KLF/Sp, TBP/TFCP2 – consistent with the ubiquitous baseline signal.

In summary, peak-cluster 15_1 represents a late-embryonic, broadly accessible promoter set that is maximally engaged during the 20–30-somite window, with strongest activity in differentiating trunk muscle and a regulatory code dominated by myogenic (MyoD/MEF2/SRF) plus general developmental TFs (Sox/Fox/Hox).

## Cluster 15_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15_2 corresponds to the canonical myogenic programme that turns paraxial mesoderm into differentiated fast-skeletal muscle fibres.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is detectable already in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP) and presomitic mesoderm (PSM; 0–5-som stage), increases during segmentation, and peaks at the 20–30-somite stages (≈ 22–24 hpf).  
   • The strongest signal (muscle_30 somites = 55.7; fast-muscle_30 somites ≈ 13.5) shows that the cluster is maximally active during late somitogenesis / early organogenesis when myofibres mature.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in:  
   • Fast-skeletal-muscle lineage (fast_muscle, generic “muscle” metacell)  
   • Differentiating somites / myotome (somites, PSM)  
   Moderate signal in earlier paraxial progenitors (NMP, tail-bud); very low in neural, endodermal or ectodermal lineages.

3. Biological / regulatory programme  
   Associated gene set is enriched for:  
   • Sarcomere and contractile apparatus: acta1a, tnnt3a, tnni1/4, tpm1/2/3, ryr1a/b, casq1, cav3, unc45b, myoz1, smyhc1  
   • Myoblast fusion / maturation: musk, cavin1, lrrfip, fhl1, mybpc1  
   • Calcium handling & metabolic genes typical of fast muscle (cacna1s/a2d1, hadha/b, cpt1cb).  
   GO/pathway terms therefore point to myofibril assembly, actin filament organisation, excitation–contraction coupling and fast-twitch fibre metabolism.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & expressed factors)  
   • Myogenic bHLH factors: Myf5 → Myod1 → Myog/Myf6 (motifs in TF-groups 41/42; genes present in set).  
   • MEF2 family (mef2aa/b/ca/cb/d) – cooperate with MRFs to activate structural genes (motif group 10).  
   • SRF/TEAD/TCF12-class factors – support cytoskeletal gene expression and myoblast fusion.  
   • Early lineage specifiers Pax3/Pax7 and Tbx (tbx18/20) motifs present, matching moderate accessibility in PSM/somite cells.  
   • Proliferative myoblast regulators E2F/FOXM1 motifs are enriched but decline as differentiation proceeds.

Taken together, peak-cluster 15_2 demarcates cis-regulatory regions that are primed in paraxial mesoderm and become highly active during late somitogenesis to drive the transcriptional programme of fast-skeletal-muscle differentiation and maturation in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 15_3

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 15_3 highlights a late-acting cis-regulatory module that turns on as embryos exit mid-somitogenesis and begin functional maturation of excitable tissues.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest at 0–10-somite stages, rises at 15–20 somites and reaches a clear maximum at 30 somites (≈ 24 hpf).  
• The sharp jump in the 30-somite pseudobulk (“muscle_30somites ≈ 45; optic-cup_20somites ≈ 22”) marks its late-somite/early-organogenesis activation window.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signals are seen in:  
• Generic skeletal-muscle lineage (especially “muscle_30somites”, with supporting but smaller peaks in fast-muscle).  
• Optic-cup/retinal neuro-epithelium (20-somite stage).  
• Differentiating neuronal populations (hindbrain, spinal cord, floor-plate, enteric & general “neurons” pseudobulks).  
Thus the cluster is shared by maturing skeletal muscle and multiple post-mitotic neuronal derivatives.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
The gene set is strongly enriched for components of excitation–contraction / excitation–secretion machinery and synaptic connectivity:  
• Ion-handling & excitability – ryr1b, cacna1ha, hcn1, scn5la, slc8a3, adcy6a.  
• Synaptic vesicle / active-zone proteins – rims2, sv2a/c, syt7b, cadpsa, rbfox1, nrxn2/3, nlgn2, gria4a, grik1/3.  
• Axon-guidance / adhesion – cntnap3, tenm2, cdh4/18/23/24, slit1b, unc5a, kirrel3.  
• Muscle / contractile ECM remodelling – ryr1b, myh11a, mylkb, smtnb, plg, capn3b.  
Together these point to a programme that equips newly differentiated neurons and muscle fibres for fast electrical signalling, synapse formation and contractile function.

4. Likely transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment coupled with expression of cognate TFs in the same cell types implicates:  
• Neurogenic bHLH factors – NeuroD (1/4/6), Atoh1/7, Olig2, Bhlhe22/23 – driving neuronal maturation.  
• Myogenic factors – Myod1, Myf5/6, Myog and the Mef2 family – for skeletal-muscle differentiation.  
• SOX cohort (Sox2/4/11/19, Sox10) – maintaining neuronal/muscle progenitor competence during transition to differentiation.  
• Homeobox / eye TFs – Pax6, Crx/Nrl, Barhl1 – consistent with the optic-cup peak.  
• RFX and NR2F nuclear-receptor motifs – typical of photoreceptor and motor-neuron gene batteries.

In summary, peak cluster 15_3 corresponds to late-somite enhancers that collectively activate the “electrically excitable cell” gene set—co-ordinating final maturation of skeletal muscle fibres and several neuronal sub-lineages (including retinal neurons)—under the combined control of myogenic bHLH/Mef2 factors and neurogenic/retinal TFs (NeuroD, Atoh, Pax6/Crx/Sox).
]

## Cluster 15_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15_4 corresponds to a late-stage neuro-muscular differentiation programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest during early somitogenesis (0-10 somites) and rises progressively afterwards.  
   • A clear surge is seen at 15-somites and peaks at 20-30-somites (≈ 19–24 hpf), matching the onset of overt neuronal maturation and skeletal-muscle differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest pseudobulk accessibility)  
   • muscle_30 somites       46.1  
   • enteric_neurons_30 somites  19.3  
   • differentiating_neurons 15-30 somites 9–12  
   • enteric_neurons_20 somites  12.5  
   Moderate but above-background values are also seen in generic “muscle”, hindbrain and spinal-cord pseudobulks.  
   ⇒ The cluster is most accessible in late skeletal muscle and in maturing central & peripheral neurons, especially the enteric lineage.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
   • Neuronal maturation / synaptogenesis: NRXN1/2/3, CNTNAP2/5, RIMS2/3, GRIN1, GRIA4, SLIT3-ROBO2, MAPT, RBFOX1/3, NPAS3, PIEZO2, ASIC1/2 etc.  
   • Axon guidance & neurite outgrowth: DCC, UNC5D, NAV2, DAB1, FGFs 13/14.  
   • Cytoskeleton & adhesion: CDH4/12/15/18, CTNNA2, LRR/TNR family.  
   • A smaller muscle module (MYF-interacting MYBPHB, SGCD, SOX6, MEF2 targets) is present, consistent with the very high signal in the “muscle_30 somites” pseudobulk.  
   Collectively, the peaks mark enhancers driving terminal differentiation of neurons (incl. enteric/sensory) and parallel maturation of skeletal muscle—i.e. the neuromuscular system that is established between 18-24 hpf.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (enriched motifs & expressed TFs)  
   • Proneural / neurogenic bHLH: NEUROD1/2/4/6, ATOH1/7, ASCL1, OLIG2, BHLHE22/23 – promote neuronal differentiation and subtype specification.  
   • TCF/LEF & TFAP4 family: integrate Wnt input during late neurogenesis (motifs TCF7/TCF12/TCF21, TFAP4).  
   • MEF2 & MYOD/MYF5/Myogenin: high MEF2/ SRF motif scores explain the skeletal-muscle spike.  
   • BACH/ARNT/Clock (circadian bHLH-PAS) motifs hint at emerging activity-dependent or metabolic regulation in maturing neurons/muscle.  
   • Onecut/PBX/HOX co-motifs (PBX1-4, MEIS, HOX clusters) reflect rostro-caudal patterning inputs still present at this stage.

Summary: Peak-cluster 15_4 comprises enhancers that become highly accessible during the 15- to 30-somite window in differentiating neurons—particularly the enteric nervous system—and in late skeletal-muscle cells. It encodes a transcriptional programme driven chiefly by proneural bHLH factors (NEUROD/ATOH/ASCL/OLIG), assisted by Wnt-TCF and MEF2/Myogenic regulators, orchestrating final neuronal wiring and neuromuscular maturation in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 15_5

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 15_5 – executive summary  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises steadily from gastrulation (0-somite) and peaks during mid-somite stages (≈15-20 somites).  
• It remains high into early organogenesis, with a late spike visible at 30-somites in the trunk muscle sample (likely reflecting vascular/endothelial cells contained in that tissue rather than myofibres themselves).  

2. Cell-type specificity (highest → lower)  
• Hemangioblasts and haemato-vascular endothelium (all time-points; strongest at 10–20 somites).  
• Early heart myocardium (8–18 somites).  
• Vascular/endothelial cells embedded in skeletal muscle at 30 somites.  
• Moderate accessibility in neural crest-derived neurons and endoderm; low elsewhere.  

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Enriched gene set: ANGPT1, FLT4 (Vegfr3), PDGFD, COL4A2, TNC, RUNX1, TAL1, STAB2, SLC4A1, HBAE1.3, etc.  
Interpretation: the cluster groups enhancers active in endothelial/haemangioblast lineages that drive  
• Vasculogenesis and angiogenic sprouting (ANGPT1, FLT4, PDGFD, COL4A2/TNC – vessel ECM).  
• Endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition and early blood specification (RUNX1, TAL1, GATA1/2 genes).  
• Vascular maturation / lymphatic identity (FLT4, FOX/Forkhead sites).  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene expression)  
• ETS family: Etv2, Fli1, Erg – master regulators of endothelial gene programmes.  
• GATA factors: Gata2a/2b, Gata6 – cooperate with ETS in both endothelial and haematopoietic enhancers.  
• Forkhead factors: Foxc1/2, Foxf1/2 – known to open chromatin at vascular and lymphatic enhancers.  
• RUNX1 / RUNX2/3 – hallmark of haemogenic endothelium; motifs highly enriched.  
• KLF family (Klf2, Klf6, Klf9) – shear-stress–responsive endothelial factors.  
• Nuclear receptors NR2F1/2/6 and RAR/RXR modules – typical of angiogenic and lymphatic endothelium.  

Taken together, peak cluster 15_5 marks a transcriptional module that is switched on just after gastrulation, maximally active while the first endothelial/haematopoietic progenitors and nascent vasculature are being specified (10-20 somite stages), and retained in vascular cells resident in heart and skeletal muscle by early organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 15_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15_6 marks a late-somitogenesis enhancer program that turns on as paraxial mesoderm transitions into differentiated fast skeletal muscle while retaining moderate activity in a subset of early hindbrain / MHB neurons.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low-moderate at 0–5-somite stages, rises by 10 somites (first clear pulse in the mid-brain–hind-brain boundary) and climbs steadily thereafter, reaching its maximum at 20–30 somites.  
   • The strongest signal is at 30-somites (e.g. muscle_30 somites ≈ 88, fast-muscle_30 somites ≈ 8), consistent with early organogenesis when myofibres assemble.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Paraxial-mesoderm derived populations:   
     – “muscle”, “fast-muscle”, “somites” and “notochord” at ≥20 somites.  
   • Neuroectoderm sub-populations with secondary peaks:  
     – Midbrain-hindbrain-boundary cells at 10 somites (≈ 35).  
     – Differentiating neurons / spinal cord show only modest enrichment (~4–5).  

3. Underlying regulatory/biological program  
   • Associated genes are enriched for sarcomere/contractility (ttn, tmod4, mustn1b, ryr3), ECM remodelling (adamts10/17, mxra5b, crtac1b), calcium handling (pnpla2, pvalb1), and axon / cell-adhesion molecules (nfasca, cadm1a, gpr62, lingo1b).  
   • Combined, these point to:  
     a) fast skeletal-muscle differentiation and maturation of the contractile apparatus,  
     b) concurrent establishment of neuromuscular connectivity and mid-hind-brain patterning cues.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
   • Myogenic bHLH & MRFs: Myod1, Myf5/6, Myog, Msc – initiate and reinforce muscle gene expression.  
   • MEF2 family (Mef2a/ca/cb/d) – activate structural sarcomere genes and stabilise the myogenic programme.  
   • TCF/LEF (Tcf21, Tcf3/7/12, Lef1) – integrate Wnt signals during myotome formation.  
   • Twist / Snail & Runx factors – remodel mesenchyme and ECM.  
   • Neurogenic bHLH (Neurod1/2/4/6, Atoh1/7, Olig2) and Sox11/4 – account for the neural/MHB component.  

In summary, peak-cluster 15_6 delineates enhancers that switch on during late somitogenesis to drive fast-skeletal-muscle assembly and, to a lesser extent, mid–hind-brain neuronal maturation, coordinated by MRF-MEF2-TCF core transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 15_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15_7 captures a late-stage skeletal-muscle enhancer program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at 0–5-somite stages (10–12 hpf) but rises gradually during segmentation.  
   • The signal reaches its maximum at 30 somites (≈24 hpf): muscle_30somites = 43.5-fold above baseline, whereas earlier time-points are ≤ 1.1.  
   → The peaks mark enhancers that switch on during the terminal phase of myofibre differentiation/ maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is confined to skeletal-muscle derivatives:  
   • ‘muscle_30somites’ (dominant)  
   • fast_muscle, somites and, to a lesser extent, myotome-containing cell clusters.  
   Non-muscle lineages show only basal (~0.7–1.0) accessibility, indicating broad chromatin openness early but functional deployment specifically in differentiating muscle.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
   Associated genes are enriched for:  
   • Sarcomeric structural proteins – ttn, tnnt1, actn3b, mybpc2a, myhz1.3, utrn  
   • Excitation–contraction machinery – ryr1b/ryr2, cacna1ab/cacna1c, piezo1/2, kcn and hcn channels  
   • Cytoskeleton / costamere assembly – syne1b, lrrc proteins, utrophin, dystrophin partners  
   • Muscle signalling & metabolism – mef2-targets, vegfba, fgf11a, ppp3ca, prkca/ prkcz  
   Functional theme: assembly of contractile apparatus, calcium handling and metabolic adaptation in fast-twitch muscle fibres.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & factor list)  
   • Myogenic bHLH factors: Myod1, Myf5, Myf6, Myog – initiate skeletal-muscle identity.  
   • MEF2 family (mef2aa/ab/b/c/d) & SRF – activate structural/contractile genes.  
   • TEAD/TCF (Hippo & Wnt effectors) and TCF12/TCF21 – cooperate in late fibre maturation.  
   • KLF (klf6/9/17) and FoxO/FoxK motifs – integrate metabolic & stress cues.  
   • Nuclear receptors NR4A / RXR & PPAR motifs – consistent with oxidative‐metabolic gene set.

Summary  
Cluster 15_7 represents a set of muscle-specific enhancers that progressively open during somitogenesis and peak in fully differentiated trunk muscle at 24 hpf, driving the transcriptional programme required for sarcomere assembly and functional maturation of fast skeletal-muscle fibres, under the control of canonical myogenic TFs (MRFs + MEF2/SRF) and modulatory factors (TCF/TEAD, KLF, Fox, NR).
]

## Cluster 15_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15_8 represents a late-somite, skeletal-muscle‐specific regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is present at low-to-moderate levels from 0–20 somites (~10–22 hpf) but rises dramatically at 30 somites (~24 hpf).  
   • The single extreme value (muscle_30 somites = 47.4 vs ~5 for other samples) pinpoints maximal activity during the final time-point, coinciding with terminal myofibre differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest signal: “muscle_30 somites” (trunk/axial muscle lineage).  
   • Secondary, much lower accessibility is seen in fast- and slow-muscle pseudobulks and in early somitic mesoderm, indicating that these regions become fully accessible only once fibres have formed.

3. Regulatory/biological program  
   • Associated gene set is enriched for contractile-apparatus and sarcomere components (ryr1b, tnni2b, tnnt3b, myh6/7, mylk3/5, myom1/2, hspb7) and calcium-handling/energy-metabolism genes (acaca, ppp3cca, ppp3ccb).  
   • Gene ontology points to muscle contraction, myofibril organisation, excitation–contraction coupling and metabolic maturation of skeletal muscle.  
   • The late surge matches the switch from proliferating myoblasts to contractile myofibres.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched in this cluster)  
   • Myogenic bHLH core: Myod1, Myf5, Myf6 (MRF family) and Myog.  
   • MEF2 family (Mef2aa/ab/b/ca/cb/d) – activates structural muscle genes downstream of the MRFs.  
   • TEAD/TEF (Tead1/3) and SRF–cofactors (Srf/Srfa) – promote sarcomere and actin-cytoskeleton genes.  
   • Tcf12/Tcf3 (E-proteins) and Tcf21 – heterodimer partners that fine-tune MRF activity.  
   • FoxO (Foxo1/3/4) and NFAT motifs appear, consistent with metabolic and calcium-dependent maturation signals.

Together, these data indicate that peak-cluster 15_8 marks the chromatin programme that unlocks the terminal contractile and metabolic gene set in zebrafish trunk skeletal muscle during the 24 hpf transition from segmentation to early organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 15_9

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15_9 captures the cis-regulatory program that turns on when paraxial mesoderm cells leave the cell cycle and terminally differentiate into skeletal (fast) muscle fibres at the end of segmentation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest and fairly constant from 0- to 15-somite stages (10–19 hpf: values ~7–9).  
   • It rises further by 20 som (≈22 hpf) and shows a sharp jump at 30 som (~24 hpf) – especially in the generic “muscle_30somites” pseudobulk (52) and in fast-muscle (9.6).  
   → The cluster is therefore a late-segmentation / early-organogenesis module that peaks during terminal myofibre differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in myogenic lineages:  
   • muscle (trunk/cranial) → strongest signal  
   • fast-muscle, somites, heart myocardium (moderate)  
   • much lower in neural, endodermal, epidermal, or tail-bud populations.  
   Thus the cluster is muscle-biased and paraxial-mesoderm–restricted.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
   Gene list is enriched for classic muscle and sarcomere components and their regulators:  
   – contractile & sarcomeric: myh7bb, myhz1.1, mybpc2a, neb, actn4, myom1b, mylk4b  
   – myoblast fusion / cytoskeleton: myo16, myo7a/b, tnni4b, vgll2b  
   – metabolic shift genes: acads, acad11, abhd16a, acacb  
   – ECM/attachment: col5a1, col5a2, col6a4a, lama2, lama4, itga5, itga11  
   – signalling for myogenesis: fgfr1b, wnt7ab, vegfab, ror1  
   Together these point to sarcomere assembly, myofibrillogenesis, cytoskeletal remodelling, and metabolic maturation of fast skeletal muscle.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene set)  
   • Myogenic bHLH factors – MyoD1, Myf5, Myf6, Myogenin (motif group 41/42)  
   • MEF2 family – Mef2c/ Mef2d/ Mef2cb (motif group 10)  
   • SRF & TEAD/TAZ (actin-cytoskeleton and Hippo inputs; motifs M00066, TEAD group)  
   • Tbx15/18/20 and Lbx1/2 – regional muscle-patterning cues  
   • Pax3/7 – early dermomyotome progenitor factors (motif groups 54, 33)  
   • Pbx/Meis/Hox partnerships – axial-level specification (groups 22, 28, 70)  

   Cooperative binding of MyoD/Myf5 with MEF2 and SRF/TEAD explains the late, high-level activation of structural muscle genes documented above.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 15_9 marks late myogenic enhancers that switch on during the 20–30-somite window, are most accessible in differentiating trunk & fast skeletal muscle, and are driven by the canonical MyoD/MEF2/SRF/TEAD network together with region-specific TBX/PBX/HOX inputs to execute sarcomere assembly, cytoskeletal organisation and metabolic maturation of zebrafish skeletal muscle fibres.
]

## Cluster 15_10

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15_10 captures a broad neuro-ectodermal program that spikes during optic-cup formation and remains detectable during later skeletal-muscle maturation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already above background at 0-somite stage, rises steadily, and shows two clear maxima:  
     – Segmentation (~15 somites, ≈18-20 hpf) highest signal (47.3)  
     – Early organogenesis (30 somites, ≈24 hpf) in the somitic musculature (45.5)  
   • Thus the cluster is most active from mid- to late-segmentation, with persistence into early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Strongest accessibility:  
     – Optic-cup / retinal precursors (15 somites)  
     – Fast-muscle / myotome (30 somites)  
   • High but lower signal in differentiating neurons (hind-/mid-brain, spinal cord), neural crest and NMP/PSM compartments.  
   • Other germ-layer derivatives (endoderm, epidermis, vasculature) show only basal (~2.5-3) accessibility.

3. Likely regulatory program  
   Gene set is enriched for:  
   • Axon guidance & neurite outgrowth (unc5c, dcc, plxna1a, robo-like, kif26b, nlgn3, nrxn3, cntn/cntnap family, ryr channels)  
   • Synapse maturation & neurotransmission (gabra3, grik4, grid2, sv2b, cacna1ab/2d3, kcnj10, slc12a5, slc24a2)  
   • Retinal specification / photoreceptor differentiation (rx1/3, vsx1, crx-like, otx, pax6 targets)  
   • Skeletal-muscle structural and Ca2+-handling genes appearing late (mybphb, smyhc1, ryr1b, troponin-related).  
   Together these reflect an early neuro-retinal developmental module that is later reused (or partly co-opted) during fast-muscle fibre maturation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif- and gene-enrichment tables point to:  
   • Eye/forebrain–retina factors Pax6a/b, Rx1/3, Otx1/2, Vsx1, Crx, Six3/6, Lhx2/9, Tbx2/3  
   • Pan-neural/neurogenic factors SoxB family (Sox2/3/19), Sox11, Sox4; Dlx1/2/4/5; FoxG1/FoxD3; homeobox GBX/EMX/OTX; NF-I and bHLH (NeuroD, Atoh)  
   • Late myogenic regulators MyoD, Myf5/6, Mef2 (motifs M00113, M00066, M00117 show positive Z-scores)  
   • General chromatin readers/writers (Kdm2b, Cxxc1) denoting long gene bodies typical of neuronal loci.

In summary, cluster 15_10 marks enhancers/coregulated regions that turn on during retinal neurogenesis, remain active in multiple neuronal lineages, and are redeployed in maturing fast muscle—driven primarily by Pax/Sox/Fox homeodomain networks and, later, by bHLH/myogenic TFs.

## Cluster 15_11

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15_11 represents a “two-phase” cis-regulatory program that is first deployed in secretory endodermal derivatives (hatching-gland + early endocrine pancreas) and is later re-used during terminal skeletal-muscle maturation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0–5-somite stages, maximal between 10–20-somites, and then collapses in the hatching-gland by 30-somites.  
   • A new wave of accessibility appears in the generic “muscle” compartment and peaks dramatically at 30-somites (≈ 50-fold above background).  
   → Early active in secretory organs; late surge in differentiating muscle.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signal)  
   • Hatching-gland (15–22 × baseline; 0–20-somites)  
   • Endocrine pancreas (≈ 5 × baseline throughout segmentation)  
   • Mature trunk/fast muscle (“muscle” 30-somites)  
   • Moderate signal in endoderm & neural derivatives; low in other lineages.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Secretory/vesicular machinery (chga, furinb, gad1b, syngap1a, stx1b, atp2a3).  
   • Extracellular protease & ECM modulation required for chorion digestion (hatching-gland) and for muscle matrix remodelling (evla, plxnb1a, tbc1d1).  
   • Metabolic & lipid-handling genes typical of endocrine cells and oxidative muscle (abca1a, hmgcra, pparab, acer3).  
   • Overall: programme that builds a high secretory capacity and later supports contractile, metabolically active myofibres.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif-enrichment + gene list overlap)  
   • Prdm1a/Blimp1 – hallmark regulator of both hatching-gland identity and fast-muscle fibre maturation.  
   • Fox family (FoxA/FoxO/FoxF) – endodermal and metabolic regulators; strong motif enrichment (M00160/1/2 series).  
   • Gata factors (Gata4/5/6 & Gata3) – secretory endoderm and pancreas specification.  
   • Myogenic TF set activated only in the late phase: MyoD/Myog, Mef2 (motifs M00161–62), Nr2f/Nr family nuclear receptors and Pparα/γ (metabolic switch).  
   • Runx / Maf / Batf family motifs support vesicle and matrix gene expression.

In summary, cluster 15_11 marks enhancers that first drive formation and secretory function of the zebrafish hatching-gland and endocrine pancreas, then become re-engaged during terminal differentiation of contractile skeletal muscle at the end of the segmentation period.

## Cluster 15_12

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15_12 highlights one broad developmental programme that begins in the surface ectoderm, is reused by the notochord and, late in somitogenesis, is co-opted by differentiating myofibres.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already appreciable at the 0-somite stage (10 hpf).  
   • It rises steadily, reaching a plateau between 10 – 20 somites (≈ 14–19 hpf).  
   • A second, sharp spike is seen at 30 somites (≈ 24 hpf) in the generic muscle pseudobulk.  

2. Cell-type specificity (highest pseudobulk scores)  
   • Surface ectoderm / epidermis (7.7 → 13.6 log counts at 0–20 somites)  
   • Notochord        (5.5 → 10.3 at 5–20 somites)  
   • Late skeletal muscle    (51 in “muscle_30somites”; moderate in earlier muscle and somite bins)  
   • Moderate signal in endocrine pancreas, fast muscle, and endoderm.

3. Putative biological programme  
   Gene content is dominated by basement-membrane and extracellular-matrix components (Col7a1, Col11a1a, Col14a1a, Col28a1a, Fras1, Itgb4, Mrc2, Sgcd), epithelial / epidermal regulators (Tp63, Krt18b, Tjp2a), cell-adhesion and signalling genes (Runx2b, Pdgfc, Wnt2bb, Smad3a).  
   ⇒ The peaks likely mark enhancers driving:  
   • Formation and maintenance of the epidermal/periderm basement membrane and epithelial barrier.  
   • Assembly of the notochordal sheath.  
   • Extracellular-matrix remodelling required for late myotome growth.

4. Key transcription-factor motifs enriched  
   • TP63 & TFAP2 family – hallmark regulators of surface ectoderm / periderm genes.  
   • SOX cluster (Sox2/3/5/9/18) – broad epithelial and notochord activity.  
   • FOX/FOXP/FOXA motifs – cooperate in epithelial-sheet and sheath programmes.  
   • HOX / DLX / MSX homeobox factors – patterning along the AP axis and in cranial ectoderm.  
   • MEF2 & SRF motifs – appear concomitantly with the 30-somite muscle spike, consistent with myofibre maturation.

In summary, cluster 15_12 contains cis-regulatory elements that are first used by the surface ectoderm to build a collagen-rich basement membrane, are reutilised by the notochord for its sheath, and are later recruited by differentiating skeletal muscle; the programme is driven primarily by TP63-SOX-FOX homeo-epithelial factors, with MEF2/SRF joining during myogenesis.

## Cluster 15_13

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15_13 marks the switch to late skeletal-muscle differentiation and the onset of its functional maturation.  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is fairly uniform (≈ 2) at earlier stages but explodes at the very end of the series – 30-somite stage (≈ 24 hpf).  
  – muscle_30somites = 46 (≫ all other values)  
  – the only other spike is a brief pulse in neural-optic cells at 5 somites (= 30), probably a technical outlier; no comparable signal is seen in the optic lineage thereafter.  
→ The regulome becomes fully active during terminal myofibre maturation (late somitogenesis/early organogenesis).

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is confined to the generic “muscle” pseudobulk at 30 somites, with modest enrichment in closely related populations (somites, fast-muscle, slow-muscle) and only background levels elsewhere. Hence the cluster is muscle-specific.

3. Underlying regulatory programme / biology  
Associated gene list is enriched for:  
• Core myofibrillar and sarcomeric genes – myog, myf6, myom1, myo6b, tnnt2d, ryr1a/​2/​3, cacna1d, adamtsl3, mmp15a (ECM remodelling needed for fibre growth)  
• Calcium-handling / excitation-contraction genes – ryr’s, calsequestrin pathway members, slc8, hspa/hspb chaperones  
• Neuromuscular junction & axon-guidance genes – chrna7, grin2c, grid1/​2, cadps2, nrxn3, ntrk3b  
• Energy / metabolic regulators – aclyb, acss3, fdft1, plin genes  

Together these point to:  
• Final assembly of contractile apparatus  
• Coupling of myofibres to motor-neurone input and Ca²⁺ signalling  
• ECM remodelling and metabolic up-scaling that accompany fast-muscle maturation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene list)  
Highly enriched motifs fall into classical myogenic cadres:  
• Myogenic bHLH factors – Myod1, Myf5, Myf6, Myog, Msc (row 41/42)  
• SRF/Mef2 family – Srf, Mef2a/b/c/d (row 10/113) – promote sarcomere gene expression  
• Tcf21 / Tcf12 / Tcf3 (rows 41, 60) – cooperate with MyoD during fibre maturation  
• TEAD & FoxO/Klf motifs – regulators of muscle growth and metabolism (rows 82, 87)  
Secondary support: Pax3/7 (early myogenic specification), E2F (cell-cycle exit), Sox4/6 (slow-to-fast fibre transition).

Summary  
Peak-cluster 15_13 is a late-acting, muscle-restricted regulatory module that turns on at ~24 hpf to drive the final wave of skeletal-muscle fibre differentiation, coordinating sarcomere assembly, Ca²⁺ handling, ECM remodelling and neuromuscular junction formation under the control of MyoD/Mef2-centred transcription-factor circuitry.
]

## Cluster 15_14

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15_14 represents a late-somitogenesis / early-organogenesis “muscle-maturation” regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest (log₂-scores ~1.6–2.1) from 0- to 20-somite stages but jumps dramatically at 30-somites (24 hpf).  
   • The largest change is in muscle_30somites (fragment score ≈ 44, >20-fold above all earlier stages), indicating a switch-on of the programme only after myoblasts have differentiated.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in:  
   • Trunk/craniofacial muscle (muscle_30somites) – dominant signal.  
   • Fast-muscle and generic somite derivatives (fast_muscle_30somites 2.43, somites_20–30somites 2.0–2.1).  
   • Very low or absent in epidermis, endoderm‐derived and neural lineages.  
   → The cluster is therefore specific to differentiated skeletal muscle fibres.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Associated gene set is highly enriched for:  
   • Contractile apparatus: myh7ba, mybpc2a, myhz1.3, actn3b, myot, tnni1a, tnni3k, tns1a, ryr1a/b, cacna1s-family, itga7/itgb4.  
   • Sarcomere assembly & costamere links: lama2, lpp, col12a1b, dystrophin (dmd), utrn.  
   • Muscle energy & Ca²⁺ handling: fasn, acsl1b, slc8a1, atp2b1a, hacd2.  
   • Myoblast fusion / maturation regulators: myomaker-like gpr-related genes, fgf and tgf-β modulators.  
   GO/pathway signature therefore points to terminal myofibre differentiation, sarcomere organisation, contraction and metabolic maturation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & mapping)  
   • Myogenic bHLH/MRFs – Myod1, Myf5, Myf6, Myog, Msc (motif group 41/42).  
   • Mef2 family & SRF – promote sarcomere gene activation (motif group 10, 113).  
   • TEAD/ Hippo and SRF co-factor motifs (Tead1/3) – involved in myofibre growth.  
   • Tcf12/3 and E-box partners – dimerise with Myod/Myf5.  
   • Supporting regulators: Klf (Klf6/9), Runx (Runx1/3), Foxo3/4 (stress-response) reflect metabolic and structural maturation.

Together these data indicate that peak-cluster 15_14 marks enhancers that turn on at the end of somitogenesis in differentiating skeletal muscle, driven principally by the canonical myogenic TF cascade (Myod/Myf-Mef2/SRF) to activate structural and metabolic genes required for functional contractile fibres.

## Cluster 16_0

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 16_0 – concise biological interpretation

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Maximal accessibility is already present at the earliest stage we profiled (0-somite / 10 hpf) and steadily tapers off through 30 somites (≈ 24 hpf).  
• The single extreme value (≈ 81 in the “neural_posterior_0somites” pseudobulk) indicates an early burst of activity in posterior neural plate/tube that is not matched later, consistent with an early-segmentation, patterning-related regulatory module.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is seen in neuro-ectoderm derivatives:  
• posterior neural plate / neural (posterior) progenitors >>  
• spinal cord, hindbrain, floor-plate and generic “neural / neurons” pseudobulks, plus differentiating-neuron populations at all time points.  
Accessibility in mesoderm- or endoderm-derived pseudobulks stays at a low baseline (~3–4), indicating that the cluster is largely neuro-restricted.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Gene set links point to posterior neural patterning and early neuronal maturation:  
• Axon guidance / synaptic adhesion – CNTN2, LRRTM4, CLSTN2, TENM2, SIPA1, FAT4, GRIK2, GRIN3B, DRD2.  
• Neural differentiation / transcriptional control – TCF4, CTBP1, FOXK2, SIPA1, PTBP1, MEF2AB, RORC.  
• Posterior identity cues – large representation of Hox genes (hoxb/d/c series) among motif enrichments.  
Taken together, peaks in cluster 16_0 annotate enhancers/promoters that switch on the genetic programme giving posterior neural progenitors their axial identity and initiating neurite outgrowth and synapse-assembly genes required for early functional maturation.

4. Key transcription factors predicted to drive the cluster  
Motif enrichment and TF-gene overlap converge on four TF families:  
• Sox family (Sox2/3/19, Sox11/4) – neural stem/progenitor maintenance and neurogenesis.  
• Posterior Hox factors (HOXB3/5, HOXD3/9, HOXC6/9/11/13) – conferring rostro-caudal positional identity.  
• Forkhead factors (FoxG1, FoxD1/3, FOXK2) – neural progenitor proliferation and regional identity.  
• MEF2 / E-box bHLH factors (MEF2A/B/D, NEUROD/ATOH, TCF4) – neuronal differentiation and synaptic gene activation.  
Supporting motifs with high z-scores include E2F (cell-cycle exit timing) and KDM2B-CXXC (CpG-rich promoter binding), but Sox–Fox–Hox–MEF2 are the most coherent driver set.

Summary  
Cluster 16_0 marks a neuro-ectoderm-specific, early-activated regulatory module that peaks in posterior neural plate at 10 hpf and remains active, at diminishing levels, in spinal-cord and differentiating-neuron lineages. It integrates Sox/Fox progenitor factors, posterior Hox positional cues and MEF2/NeuroD differentiation factors to coordinate axial patterning with the onset of neuronal maturation and synaptic connectivity.

## Cluster 16_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 16_1 captures the chromatin programme of posterior axial progenitors that drive rapid trunk-tail extension.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility peaks at the earliest stages (0-10 somite/10-14 hpf), falls by ~15 somites and is largely closed by 30 somites.  
   • This “early-high, late-low” profile indicates functions confined to gastrulation and the first half of somitogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Tail-bud (posterior organiser) – extreme signal (82 at 0 somites; >8 up to 20 somites).  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs).  
   • Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and forming somites.  
   • Notochord > early fast/slow muscle.  
   (Most neural/endodermal populations show only baseline ~6, confirming a posterior mesoderm focus.)

3. Likely biological processes  
   • Posterior body-axis elongation and segmentation (Hox/Cdx-controlled A-P patterning, somitogenesis).  
   • Maintenance and differentiation of NMPs into paraxial mesoderm and notochord.  
   • Early trunk muscle priming.  
   These inferences are supported by the large set of associated genes enriched for Hox clusters (a–d), Cdx1/4, Lhx, Dlx, Nkx, Tbx, Meox, Mnx, Uncx, etc., all classical regulators of axial patterning and somitic mesoderm.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + factor mapping)  
   • Hox paralog groups 5-13 (posterior Hox code) – patterning along the A-P axis.  
   • Cdx (cdx1b/4) – posterior identity and tail-bud proliferation.  
   • Sox19/2/3/5 and Fox (FoxD, FoxF, FoxA) – maintain NMP identity and mesoderm competence.  
   • Tbx family (Tbx6/Tbx16) and Mesp – segmentation clock/PSM.  
   • Lhx/Lbx/Uncx/Dlx – motor neuron and dermomyotome precursors emerging from the PSM.  
   • E2F/FOX M1 signatures – high cell-cycle activity typical of the tail-bud.

Together, cluster 16_1 marks a set of regulatory elements that are maximally open in rapidly dividing posterior progenitors and presomitic mesoderm during the window when the zebrafish trunk and tail are being laid down.
]

## Cluster 16_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 16_2 – Posterior-axis / tail-bud progenitor module  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Maximal accessibility at the very first segmentation stage (0-somite): tail-bud_0-somites explodes to 79 (all other values ≈3).  
• Accessibility falls rapidly but is still above background in the tail bud through 5-20 somites and in early NMP / presomitic mesoderm; it is largely extinguished by 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
⇒ The module is therefore active during the window of axis elongation and early somitogenesis (10–18 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signals)  
• Tail-bud cells (posterior growth zone) – strongest by far.  
• Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) and presomitic mesoderm (PSM).  
• Moderate signal in early trunk neural plate / generic “neural” and “somites” pseudobulks; minimal in differentiated organ primordia.  

3. Regulatory programme indicated  
Associated gene list and motif content are dominated by:  
• Posterior Hox genes (multiple hoxb/c/d paralogs), Cdx1b/4, Brachyury/ta, Tbx16, Uncx, Lbx, Mnx, Lhx, Sp8, Msgn → canonical drivers of trunk/tail patterning and somitogenesis.  
• Cell-cycle / proliferation factors (E2F set) – consistent with highly proliferative tail-bud progenitors.  
• Numerous Fox and Sox family members that maintain bipotent NMP identity.  
Hence the peak set likely represents enhancers driving:  
• Posterior axial elongation, convergent extension and segmentation clock activity.  
• Coordinated activation of posterior Hox codes and mesoderm / neural progenitor maintenance genes.  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
Posterior patterning & NMP maintenance:  
• CDX (Cdx1b/4) – upstream activator of posterior Hox loci.  
• HOX-PG9-13 factors together with PBX/MEIS cofactors – read-out of axial position.  
• T/Brachyury and TBX16 – core of tail-bud mesoderm module.  
• FOX (Foxc1/2, Foxd3/5, Foxa) and SOX (Sox2/3/19) – keep NMPs bipotent.  
• TCF/LEF and β-catenin motifs – Wnt signalling hallmark of the tail bud.  
• E2F1-3/DP and MYB/MAF minor peaks – reflect high cycling rate.  

In sum, cluster 16_2 captures the chromatin programme that equips posterior growth-zone progenitors with the regulatory landscape needed for continuous axial extension and early somite formation, peaking at the onset of segmentation and tapering off as the tail bud exhausts.
]

## Cluster 16_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 16_3 captures the cis-regulatory program that is switched on in posterior axial progenitors at the onset of somitogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is maximal at the 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf): the tail-bud pseudobulk jumps to 87 (all other samples hover around 8-12).  
   • Accessibility steadily falls through 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-somite stages and is largely extinguished by the 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf).  
   → The cluster therefore marks an early, transient window that coincides with tail-bud outgrowth and the first 2-3 cycles of somite formation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Dominant in Tail-bud (posterior growth zone).  
   • Secondary but appreciable signal in Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and very young Somites; negligible in differentiated neural, endodermal or organ primordia.  
   → The regions are specific to posterior axial progenitors and their immediate mesodermal descendants.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
   Linked genes are a textbook signature of posterior body-axis extension and segmentation:  
   • Axis-patterning / posterior identity: ta (brachyury), tb, cdx1b, cdx4, multiple posterior Hox genes (hoxb4/5/6/7/9, hoxa9/10, hoxc9/10/11/12/13).  
   • FGF/Wnt signalling components that sustain NMPs: fgf8b, rspo2, tcf7l2, lef1, wnt-responsive regulators (sp5/8, axin2-like).  
   • Segmentation clock / somitogenesis factors: her/hes family, mespa/b, tbx6/16, tbx24.  
   • Cytoskeletal and ECM genes needed for convergent extension and tail elongation (vcl, svep1, lama1, etc.).  
   Collectively these point to control of posterior axial elongation, maintenance of the NMP pool, presomitic mesoderm specification and the early segmentation clock.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (highest motif Z-scores and presence in gene list)  
   • T-box/Brachyury family: Ta (brachyury), Tb, Tbx16/6 – core activators of tail-bud and PSM genes.  
   • Cdx homeobox factors (Cdx1b, Cdx4) – set posterior Hox code and drive Fgf/Wnt loops.  
   • Posterior Hox clusters (paralog groups 5-13) – establish axial identity of emerging somites.  
   • Wnt/β-catenin effectors TCF7/TCF7L2/LEF1 – motifs strongly enriched and genes expressed; couple Wnt signalling to target enhancers.  
   • Foxa/Foxc/Foxf subgroup – consistent motif enrichment and gene presence (foxc1a/b, foxf2a/b) linked to mesoderm motility.  
   • E2F/FOX M1 cell-cycle module – moderate enrichment reflects the high proliferative state of tail-bud progenitors.

In summary, peak-cluster 16_3 represents enhancers that are briefly and strongly opened in the tail-bud/NMP compartment at the start of somitogenesis, orchestrated by T-box, Cdx, posterior Hox and Wnt-TCF factors to drive posterior body-axis extension, presomitic mesoderm formation and the early segmentation programme.

## Cluster 16_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 16_4 corresponds to a set of promoter-like/CpG-rich regions that are open in virtually every cell type we profiled, but they transiently “spike” in cardiopharyngeal mesoderm just as this lineage first emerges.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at the earliest time-point (0-somite stage, 10 hpf) and then remains nearly constant (±10 – 15 %) through 24 hpf.  
• The only pronounced temporal accent is a very strong burst at 0-somite in cardiopharyngeal derivatives (heart-primordium and first pharyngeal-arch mesoderm).

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signals (in descending order)  
• Heart myocardium – 0-somite (≈ 48-fold above background).  
• Pharyngeal-arch mesoderm – 0-somite (≈ 78-fold).  
• Moderate, uniform accessibility (≈ 3-fold) in most other neural, mesodermal and endodermal populations.  
Hence the cluster is broadly accessible yet maximally enriched in the earliest cardiopharyngeal field.

3. Implied regulatory programme  
The peak set sits near/within genes that encode core cellular-machinery components (cell-cycle, chromatin and translation factors: anapc1, cdc45, cdca8, kdm2a/b, dnmt1, nop2, metap1) together with several genes essential for early cardiopharyngeal and craniofacial morphogenesis (plcb4, fat4, vangl2, sema5a, unc5da).  
Taken together, the cluster appears to mark “house-keeping” promoters that are constitutively open, but which are temporarily super-activated in rapidly proliferating, early cardiac/pharyngeal mesoderm where cell-cycle pace is maximal and PCP/Hippo signalling components are first induced.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment points to two layers of control.  
• Global CpG-island binders: CXXC-domain proteins (CXXC1/CFP1), KDM2B/A – consistent with constitutive, promoter-type accessibility.  
• Cardiopharyngeal-specific boost: FOX (Foxc1/foxd3/foxf2), PBX/MEIS, NKX-family, TBX1/5, GATA4/6 and TEAD3 (Hippo pathway) motifs are all over-represented; these TFs are canonical regulators of heart-field and pharyngeal-arch mesoderm expansion.

In short, cluster 16_4 delineates broadly open promoter/CpG regions that reach their highest activity in the nascent cardiopharyngeal mesoderm at the 0-somite stage, driven by a combination of ubiquitous CpG-binding factors (KDM2B/CXXC) and early heart/pharyngeal TFs (FOX, PBX-MEIS, NKX, TBX, GATA, TEAD).
]

## Cluster 16_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 16_5 represents a late-stage, “differentiation/maturation” chromatin programme that is switched on once progenitors start to specialise into electrically or secretory active cells (muscle fibres, neurons, endocrine pancreas).

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Modest accessibility at 10-15 hpf; sharp rise by 20 hpf and maximal at the 30-somite (~24 hpf) stage.  
   • Is already open in the very first formed somites (0-somite sample) and then re-opens more broadly later, indicating early priming followed by re-activation during terminal differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest values)  
   • Paraxial mesoderm derivatives – nascent somites, posterior presomitic mesoderm and fast muscle (muscle_30 somites ≈ 4-fold above background).  
   • Endocrine pancreas and general endoderm at 30 somites.  
   • Enteric / peripheral neurons and differentiating CNS neurons.  
   • Low–moderate, almost housekeeping accessibility in most other lineages.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
   • Ion-channel and synaptic genes (GRIK3, GRIN2D, GRID1, HCN1, many KCN / KCNQ / SLC transporters) – neuronal excitability.  
   • Cytoskeleton / adhesion (CNTN1, CDH18, OPCML, DAAM2, Dock4) – neurite- and myofibre morphogenesis.  
   • Secretory/endocrine genes (SLC2A2, FGF24, STAT5A, ZBTB20) – pancreatic β-cell maturation & hormone release.  
   • Myofibrillar / muscle signalling components (MEF2 targets, VAV2, FYNB) – myotome differentiation.  
   In GO terms this maps to axon guidance, membrane depolarisation, Ca²⁺/K⁺ transport and regulated secretion.

4. Key transcription-factor motifs driving the cluster  
   • MEF2 / SRF and TCF21/MSC ­– core myogenic regulators of somite-to-muscle transition.  
   • PAX6/7, SOX4/5/11/21 – neurogenic and pancreatic endocrine specification.  
   • GATA4/5/6 together with HNF4/1 and ONECUT – endoderm-pancreas maturation module.  
   • NFAT family & CREB/ATF-bZIP factors – activity-dependent genes in excitable cells.  
   • Nuclear receptors (RORα/β/γ, NR2F/COUP-TF, RXR/RA receptors, thyroid hormone receptors) – metabolic and circadian tuning of differentiated tissues.  
   • CXXC-KDM2B & E2F motifs – CpG-rich promoter architecture and progenitor proliferation link.

Overall, cluster 16_5 marks genomic regions that become accessible as embryonic cells exit proliferation and acquire mature, electrophysiologically active phenotypes – especially in skeletal muscle, neurons (enteric and CNS) and the endocrine pancreas – during the 20- to 30-somite window of zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 17_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 17_0 corresponds to a set of regulatory elements that are almost exclusively open in the axial-mesoderm / notochord lineage during the somitogenesis window.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at the 0-somite stage (10 hpf), rises further between 5–15 somites (≈11-16 hpf; 40–48 a.u. in notochord pseudobulk) and begins to fall by 20 somites.  
   • By 30 somites (≈24 hpf) accessibility has largely shut down, indicating these elements act during early-to-mid somitogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Notochord is the dominant cell type (≈5- to 10-fold higher signal than any other population).  
   • Moderate signal is seen in immediate progenitors of the notochord (tail-bud/NMPs) and in paraxial mesoderm (PSM, early somites).  
   • Neural, endodermal, and ectodermal derivatives show only baseline accessibility.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Associated genes encode classical notochord structural and signalling components:  
     – ECM / sheath: col2a1a, col4a6, col5a3a, colgalt1, emilin3a, chst3b  
     – Hedgehog & TGFβ signalling: ihhb (zebraﬁsh IHH orthologue), tgfb1b  
     – Axon guidance / midline cues: slit2, robo2, neo1a, rspondin2  
     – Planar-cell-polarity & morphogenesis: celsr1a, adamts18, magi3, mtss1  
   • GO terms emerging from these loci (ECM organisation, axial patterning, Hedgehog signalling) point to a programme controlling notochord differentiation, sheath assembly and its organizer role for surrounding tissues.

4. Candidate transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and TF–motif mapping converge on a small set of axial-mesoderm regulators:  
   • T-box / Brachyury (ta / tbxta) – core driver of notochord fate; strong enrichment of TBX‐class motifs (group 62).  
   • FoxA family (foxa1/foxa2) and Noto – pioneer factors required for notochord gene activation; FOX motifs are among the strongest hits (groups 2–5, 56, 68, 107).  
   • Homeobox midline factors – Hox-C/D and Uncx/Nkx1.2 motifs (groups 3–5, 70, 72) suggest rostro-caudal patterning inputs.  
   • GLIS/ZNF & Klf/Egr modules (glis1b, klf9/13) likely modulate ECM and hedgehog pathway targets.  
   • E2F/FOXM1 motifs (group 6) are present but probably reflect the high proliferative state of tail-bud progenitors rather than lineage specificity.

Together, the data indicate that cluster 17_0 harbours enhancers driving the early differentiation and maturation of the zebrafish notochord, under the control of Brachyury, FoxA, Noto and cooperating Homeobox factors, with activity peaking between the shield stage and ~15-somite stage and tapering off once notochord morphogenesis is complete.
]

## Cluster 17_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 17_1 is an “anterior-neural / eye-field” regulatory module that becomes highly accessible when the optic vesicle/cup and forebrain are being specified.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high by the 0-somite stage (10 hpf) but climbs further at 5–20 somites (≈12–19 hpf), peaking at 5-, 10- and 15-somite stages.  
   • Signal falls back slightly by 30 somites (24 hpf), indicating this programme is most active during early–mid somitogenesis, when the eye field, optic cup and rostral brain domains are being patterned.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signals)  
   • neural_optic lineage – “neural_optic_5 som” (6.4 a.u.), 10/15/20 som (>6 a.u.)  
   • forebrain / anterior neural plate (neural_*, neural_telencephalon_*)  
   • differentiating neurons (early neuroblasts)  
   • lower but above-background signal is seen in general neural ectoderm and hindbrain, but mesoderm/endoderm scores are ∼1 log-unit lower.

3. Regulatory programme represented  
   • Eye-field specification and optic cup morphogenesis (genes: rx1/2/3, six3/6/7, crx, vsx1, pax6, otx1/2, hmx1/4, rorb, rpe65).  
   • Anterior neural plate patterning and neural-progenitor maintenance (sox2/3/19, foxg1, foxd1, irx, lhx, dlx, uncx).  
   • Retinoic-acid and thyroid / steroid nuclear-receptor signalling (dense motif enrichment for RAR/RXR, NR2F, NR4A, THR, PPAR).  
   • Early neurogenic differentiation and cell-cycle exit (E2F, MEF2, NEUROD/ATOH motifs; associated genes neurod1/4/6, atoh1/7).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif + gene co-enrichment)  
   • Eye-field TFs: PAX6, RAX (rx genes), SIX3/6, VSX1, CRX  
   • SOX pluripotent/neural factors: SOX2/3/19, SOX4/11  
   • FOX family: FOXG1, FOXD1/3, FOXI, FOXC1—help set anterior identity and optic stalk/retina boundary  
   • IRX & DLX homeobox proteins, OTX1/2 – rostro-caudal patterning  
   • Nuclear receptors responding to retinoic acid & thyroid hormone: RARα/β/γ, RXRα/β, NR2F1/2, NR4A1/2, THRα/β – consistent with RA-driven optic-cup morphogenesis  
   • E2F/MEF2/CREB modules – couple progenitor proliferation with onset of neurogenesis.

In summary, cluster 17_1 marks cis-regulatory elements that coordinate retinoic-acid-dependent anterior neural and eye-field development, with peak activity during 5–20-somite stages and strongest accessibility in optic-cup/forebrain progenitors and early neurons, orchestrated by PAX6/SIX/RX/SOX/FOX homeodomain–TF networks together with RA-sensing nuclear receptors.

## Cluster 17_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 17_2 captures a short but pronounced wave of chromatin opening that coincides with the burst of tissue expansion that occurs in mid-somitogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at 0–10-somite stages (≈10–15 hpf), peaks sharply at 15 somites (~17 hpf; values double to >10 in many pseudobulks), and falls back to baseline by 20–30 somites.  
   • Thus the cluster is most active during a single mid-somite window centred on ~17 hpf.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility at 15 somites is seen in:  
   • Highly proliferative axial progenitors – neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) and presomitic mesoderm (PSM)  
   • Endoderm-derived primordia – endocrine-pancreas and hatching-gland epithelium  
   • Emerging organ rudiments – heart myocardium, hemangioblasts/hematopoietic vasculature, floor-plate, fast muscle, endodermal gut tube  
   • Signal is pan-germ-layer but accentuated in these fast-growing tissues, indicating a proliferation-linked rather than lineage-restricted module.

3. Putative regulatory programme  
   Associated genes are enriched for:  
   • Cell-cycle drivers and checkpoints (ccnd2a, chek2, anln, kdm2b, babam2)  
   • Ras/ERK and cAMP signalling modules (MRAS, RAPGEF4, SHC2, GRAP2B, PRKAR2B, MAP2K4a, MAPK8IP2/3)  
   • Cytoskeleton / polarity (ANLN, DOCK5, LAMB1a, PARD3bb) and metabolic support (SLC2A1b, NDUFA4l)  
   Together they point to enhancers that activate a genome-wide growth-and-division programme required for the rapid enlargement and patterning of multiple organs at mid-somitogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor inputs (motifs with highest enrichment)  
   • E2F family (E2F1/2/3/4/5/7) and FOXM1 – canonical S-phase/mitotic regulators likely driving the proliferation burst.  
   • SOX / FOX pioneer factors – maintain open chromatin and couple the generic cell-cycle module to lineage-specific programmes.  
   • MEF2 and GATA motifs appear at lower but significant levels, reflecting integration of the generic proliferation signal with muscle/heart (MEF2) and endoderm (GATA) lineages.  

In summary, peak-cluster 17_2 marks a transient, multi-lineage enhancer set that switches on around 15 somites to drive a coordinated Ras-MAPK/E2F-dependent proliferation surge across rapidly growing zebrafish tissues, before being shut down as differentiation accelerates.
]

## Cluster 17_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 17_3 represents a set of regulatory regions that are open very early in somitogenesis and then shut down rapidly once organ primordia start to mature.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is uniformly high from gastrulation/0-somite (~10 hpf) through 20-somite (~19 hpf) stages (scores ≈ 6-7).  
   • Accessibility collapses at the 30-somite time point (~24 hpf; most pseudobulks fall to <1), indicating that the programme is largely terminated by early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • At early stages the peaks are accessible in virtually every lineage, but the strongest signals are seen in trunk progenitor populations:  
     – Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs)  
     – Tail-bud and paraxial mesoderm (PSM / somites)  
     – Early neuroectoderm (hind-/spinal cord, neural crest, differentiating neurons)  
   • Epithelial/endodermal derivatives and late differentiating tissues show much weaker or absent accessibility after 20 somites.  
   → The cluster therefore marks a “pan-progenitor” chromatin state that is shared by most rapidly proliferating trunk cells during axis extension.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Enriched gene set: thousands of housekeeping genes (ribosome, replication, RNA-processing), but also a broad catalogue of early developmental regulators (Hox, Sox, Fox, Pax, Nkx, Tbx, etc.).  
   GO / pathway signature points to:  
   • Cell-cycle progression and DNA replication  
   • General transcription/translation machinery  
   • Chromatin organisation and DNA methylation  
   • Early axial-patterning and progenitor maintenance genes (Hox code, Wnt/Fgf response factors).  
   Functionally, the cluster appears to provide the ubiquitous “open‐for-business” landscape that supports high biosynthetic output and rapid proliferation while keeping multiple lineage-specification loci poised. Its disappearance coincides with lineage commitment and chromatin compaction that characterise early organogenesis.

4. Likely driver transcription factors  
   Motif enrichment is broad but dominated by factors that (i) control the cell cycle and chromatin state and (ii) keep progenitors multipotent:  
   • E2F family (E2F1/2/3/4/5/7/8) – S-phase entry, proliferation  
   • FOX family pioneer factors (FOXA, FOXK, FOXC, FOXD) – opening chromatin and coordinating metabolic genes  
   • SOXB group (SOX2/3/19) – pluripotency-like neural/mesodermal progenitor maintenance  
   • HOX / PBX / MEIS combinations – axial identity genes kept accessible but not yet restricted  
   • TEAD & SRF/MEF2 traces – mechanical-growth signalling  
   The high, non-selective accessibility together with this TF palette argues that 17_3 is a global, progenitor-state chromatin module governed by ubiquitous cell-cycle/house-keeping TFs (E2F, MYC-like FOXK) and pioneer factors (SOX, FOXA/K) that keep developmental loci competent until lineage-specific programmes (other peak clusters) take over.

In summary, cluster 17_3 defines a transient, broadly accessible chromatin landscape used by proliferative trunk progenitors during axis elongation; it is dismantled as zebrafish embryos transition into tissue-restricted organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 17_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 17_4 represents a large set of regulatory regions that are open in many – but not all – embryonic lineages.  Inspection of the pseudo-bulk accessibility, the linked genes and the enriched motifs points to a core programme that supports early “mesenchyme / endothelium / endoderm” morphogenesis, i.e. cell migration, extracellular–matrix production and initial vascular / organ priming.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises immediately after gastrulation and is already high at 0–5-somite stages.  
   • It stays maximal through 10–20-somite stages (≈12–19 hpf), then falls in a subset of tissues (e.g. NMPs drop from 3.4 to 0.6 by 30 somites), indicating that the regions are predominantly used during early patterning and the first wave of organ formation.  

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Endoderm & its derivatives – common endoderm (3.2–4.0), endocrine-pancreas (>3.6), liver/hatching-gland (>3.5).  
   • Haemangioblast / nascent vasculature (3.6–4.0) and lateral-plate mesoderm.  
   • Early mesenchyme-like populations (pharyngeal arches, cranial mesenchyme), neural crest and differentiating neurons keep the loci open (≈3.1–3.6).  
   • Accessibility is clearly lower in late trunk mesoderm (NMP 30 som, PSM 30 som) and mature muscle, emphasising the mesenchymal / migratory bias.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Linked genes are heavily enriched for:  
   • Extracellular-matrix structural genes (Collagens I/II/IV/VI, Col12a1, Col21a1, etc.), integrins (Itga5/8/10, Itgb3), MMP/ADAM family proteases – pointing to ECM production & remodelling.  
   • Guidance / signalling molecules important for tissue invasion and angiogenesis (Vegfaa/c, Semas, Ephrins, Robo/Slit, Fgf16, Wnt4, Pdgf ), and early vascular/endothelial markers (Fli1, Pdgfra, Tie/Angpt).  
   • Endoderm/visceral organ priming genes (Pdx1, Sox17, Gata4/5/6).  
   Collectively this suggests that cluster 17_4 coordinates EMT-like transitions, cell migration, early vasculature assembly and endodermal organ budding during the 10–24 hpf window.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif-enrichment plus factor mapping highlights four cooperative TF families that match the biology above:  
   • ETS factors (Etv2, Fli1, Erg, Elf1/2) – master regulators of endothelial/haemangioblast identity and ECM gene activation.  
   • GATA factors (Gata4/5/6, Gata2/3) – drive endoderm specification and endothelial competence.  
   • FOX / SOX family members (Foxc1/Foxf2/Foxa, Sox17/9/5) – promote mesendoderm identity, EMT and organ budding.  
   • KLF / SP / MEF2 / TEAD support generic mesenchymal proliferation & ECM transcription.  

Together these observations indicate that peak-cluster 17_4 encodes a “migratory mesendoderm / early endothelium” enhancer set that is deployed broadly during the somite stages to build the embryonic vasculature, foregut-derived organs and cranial mesenchyme, and is switched off as cells terminate migration and begin lineage-specific maturation.
]

## Cluster 17_5

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 17_5 marks a set of regulatory elements that switch on very early in segmentation and then progressively shut down.

1. Temporal dynamics  
∙ Accessibility is already high at the 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf), reaches its maximum between 5- and 10-somites (≈11–14 hpf), declines after 15-somites and is largely closed by 30-somites (24 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signal)  
1. Surface ectoderm / epidermis (all early somite stages; epidermis_0–20 somites > 9–11 ATAC units).  
2. Early paraxial mesoderm / myotome (muscle_0–15 somites ≈ 9–11).  
3. Early enteric-neuron progenitors (enteric_neurons_0 somites ≈ 10, then falling).  
Moderate signal is seen in NMPs and neural-crest derivatives; most other lineages stay near background.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
The linked gene set is enriched for:  
∙ Basal-lamina / ECM assembly and remodelling (lamc2, lama5, nid2a, multiple collagens, tnc, mmp11/13, adamts6/10/15/18).  
∙ Cell-adhesion and guidance receptors (cadm1/4, l1cam, itga4/5, itgb1a, robo1-3, sema3/5/6).  
∙ Wnt and FGF signalling components (wnt3, wnt3a, fgfr1a, rspo2).  
∙ Epidermal-keratinocyte markers (tp63, krt1-c5, krt97) and myotome Ca-handling genes (ryr1a, ryr2b).  

Together these point to a programme that builds and remodels basement membrane and cell-adhesion interfaces during:  
• epidermal sheet formation and stratification,  
• myotome (skeletal-muscle) differentiation inside newly formed somites, and  
• early migration/outgrowth of enteric (and some cranial) neurons.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (supported by motif enrichment & gene presence)  
• TP63 / TFCP2-like – master regulator of epidermal keratinocytes; strongest enriched motifs (M00111-113 series).  
• MEF2 / SRF family – muscle/myotome differentiation (motifs MEF2A/B/C/D, SRF).  
• PAX3 / PAX7 and SOX10/SOX9 – shared regulators of dermomyotome, neural-crest–derived peripheral neurons and pigment cells; motifs and genes present.  
• FOX & KLF families (FOXD3/FOXF2/FOXC1; KLF5/6/17 motifs) – epithelial–mesenchymal signalling and matrix genes.  
• AP-1 (FOS/JUN, BATF) and EGR/MAF factors – cooperate in ECM-remodelling gene induction.  

In summary, peak cluster 17_5 encodes an early, transient regulatory module that coordinates epidermal maturation, somite/myotome formation and initial peripheral-neuron migration by recruiting TP63-, MEF2-, PAX/SOX- and FOX/KLF-centred transcriptional networks.
]

## Cluster 17_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 17_6 – concise biological annotation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is low and almost flat during gastrulation/early somitogenesis (0–5 somites).  
• It begins to rise at 10 somites (~14 hpf) and climbs steadily, reaching its maximum at 20–30 somites (19–24 hpf).  
→ The elements in this cluster are switched on just as neurogenesis starts and remain open through early neuronal maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signal (bold ≈3–4-fold above background) is seen in:  
• differentiating_neurons (all later stages)  
• enteric_neurons (already high at 0 somites and further increases)  
• generic “neurons”, spinal cord and hind-/mid-brain sub-pseudobulks show moderate enrichment.  
Most mesoderm, endoderm, epidermis or muscle pseudobulks stay at baseline.  
→ Cluster 17_6 is neuron-restricted, with a particular bias toward nascent CNS neurons and early enteric / autonomic lineages.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
Associated genes encode:  
• neuronal neurotransmitter machinery (slc17a7a – vGlut1, gad1b, scn8ab, slc6a6b, scg3)  
• axon guidance / neurite outgrowth (ret, unc5a, unc5d, epha4b, efna2/3, slit-like genes)  
• synapse organisation & plasticity (lrrtm4, lrba, nlgn2a, lrbb, gpr158a, astn1, caskin1)  
• neurotrophic signalling and neuronal survival (ntrk3b, ngfrb, gfra4a, fgf13a)  
• patterning / identity factors of hind-brain, spinal and autonomic neurons (phox2a/b, pbx1/3, lmx1a/b, dlx cluster, hox A/B genes, rorab).  

GO terms (quick manual inspection) therefore converge on neurogenesis, axonogenesis and synaptogenesis.  
→ Peak-cluster 17_6 demarcates the transcriptional/epigenetic programme that drives transition from neuronal progenitor to young, projecting neuron.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (from motif enrichment & TF list)  
Motif set and TF-gene overlap point to two cooperating modules:  

A. Generic neurogenic activators  
   – SOX11/4/14, SOX21, SOX19 (strong Sox motif block)  
   – NEUROD / bHLH proneural factors (NEUROD1/4/6, ATOH, OLIG)  
   – MEF2 family (activity-dependent maturation)  

B. Regional / subtype homeobox code  
   – PBX/MEIS-HOX TALE complex (numerous HOX-A/B/C motifs + pbx1/3 genes)  
   – LIM-homeodomain (LHX1/2/4/9, LMX1A/B)  
   – DLX1/2/5/6, BARHL, VAX, PAX6/7  
   – PHOX2A/B and RET module (characteristic of enteric/autonomic motor neurons)  

Together these factors can explain both the broad neuronal activation and the enteric / hind-brain bias.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 17_6 represents late-somite neurogenic enhancers. They open as embryonic neuroblasts exit the cell-cycle, become post-mitotic and start axon outgrowth, with strongest activity in differentiating CNS and enteric neurons. The enhancer set is driven by a Sox-/bHLH-based generic neurogenic module that is refined by HOX-PBX/LIM-HD patterning factors and PHOX2-RET signalling to specify neuronal subtype identity.
]

## Cluster 17_7

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 17_7 corresponds to the early paraxial‐mesoderm / somitogenesis programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Highest accessibility between 0–10 somites (≈10–14 hpf).  
• Gradually falls at 15–20 somites and is largely closed by 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
→ Indicates a role during the segmentation window rather than later organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• Strongest signal in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and forming somites.  
• Moderate in notochord and nascent fast-muscle fibres; low in neural, endodermal or ectodermal derivatives.  
→ Cluster marks the progenitor-to-somite continuum along the posterior axis.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Gene set and motif content point to classic somitogenesis pathways:  
• Segmentation clock / anterior-posterior patterning – Notch (rbpj, her/hes targets), Wnt/β-catenin, FGF, RA/Hox gradients.  
• Paraxial-mesoderm identity – tbx6/tbx16, mesp-a/b, cdx, foxf1/2, ripply, meox, uncx, pax3/7.  
• Early myogenesis – myf5/myod, mef2, myog, myf6; extracellular-matrix and integrin genes needed for somite epithelialisation.  
• Retinoic-acid-responsive Hox clusters (multiple Hoxa/b/c loci) specifying rostro-caudal somite identity.  
Overall, peaks likely correspond to enhancers that turn on and off cyclically with the segmentation clock and then hand off to myogenic and axial-patterning programmes in the maturing somite.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment and gene enrichment converge on:  
• T-box factors: Brachyury (tbxt), Tbx6, Tbx16 – initiate paraxial fate.  
• Mesp-b / Ripply1–2 – boundary formation.  
• HoxA/B/C clusters plus Cdx1/4 – rostro-caudal specification.  
• Fox family (Foxc1/2, Foxf1/2, Foxa) – mesoderm epithelialisation and RA crosstalk.  
• RA receptors (Rara/b, Rxra/b) & Pbx/Meis co-factors – RA-dependent axial patterning.  
• Notch effectors (RBPJ, Hes/Her), TCF/LEF – segmentation-clock input.  
• Myogenic regulators (Pax3/7, Myod/Myf5, Mef2) – transition to muscle fate.  
These factors together explain the strong, early, mesoderm-restricted accessibility profile of cluster 17_7.
]

## Cluster 17_8

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 17_8 marks a set of regulatory elements that switch on during the mid-somite window and are reused by several closely related organogenic lineages.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises from the 0- to 5-somite stages, reaches a sharp maximum at ~10 somites (~13-15 hpf), and then gradually falls by 20–30 somites (20-24 hpf).  
   • The 10-somite peak is seen in every strongly positive cell type (see below).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest log-accessibility)  
   • Neural-crest cells: 10–11.6 across 0-30 somites – the strongest signal.  
   • Endocrine-pancreas primordium: 9.3–10.8.  
   • Heart myocardium (early cardiomyocytes): 9.2–10.1.  
   • Secondary, but clearly above background: fast/para-axial muscle, lateral-plate‐derived hemangioblast/vasculature, epidermis.

3. Inferred regulatory programme / biological processes  
   The associated gene set is enriched for:  
   • Neural-crest specification & EMT/migration (sox10, foxd3, tfap2, snai1/2, zeb, runx, collagens, fn1a).  
   • Cardiac progenitor and early cardiomyocyte differentiation (gata4/5/6, tbx1/5/20, nkx2.5, mef2, hand2, bmp4/5, vegfab).  
   • Endodermal–pancreatic endocrine commitment (pdx1, gata6, hnf4a, sox17, foxa1/2, nkx2.2).  
   • Broad extracellular-matrix remodelling and cell–matrix signalling genes (many collagens, fn1, itga4/8, itga11, mmp11/15, angpt1/2) consistent with migratory/organ-bud morphogenesis.  
   Taken together, the cluster appears to house enhancers that coordinate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and early organ bud formation for neural-crest derivatives, heart, and pancreas during the mid-somite window.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched and matching lineage TFs)  
   • SOX family (SOX10, SOX9, SOX17, SOX2) – neural-crest & endoderm.  
   • FOX family (FOXD3, FOXA1/2, FOXC1, FOXF2) – EMT, endoderm, mesoderm migration.  
   • GATA factors (GATA4/5/6, GATA3/2) – cardiac and pancreatic specification.  
   • TBX factors (TBX1/5/20), NKX2-5 – cardiac field.  
   • TFAP2 (AP-2α/β) & PAX3/7 – neural-crest initiation.  
   • MEF2A/C/D – onset of muscle/cardiac differentiation.  
   • RUNX (RUNX2/3) & HOX/IRX/PBX cofactors – regional patterning.  
   • Supporting regulators: E2F/FOXM1 (proliferative progenitors), CREB/ATF & BATF/JUN (stress and morphogenesis signalling).

In summary, peak cluster 17_8 represents mid-somite-stage enhancers that are maximally open in neural-crest, early cardiac, and endocrine-pancreatic progenitors, orchestrated by SOX-FOX-GATA-TBX/NKX transcription-factor networks that drive EMT, migration, and early organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 17_9

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 17_9 captures a regulatory program that is transiently active during the mid-somite stages and is shared by axial midline and hind-brain‐neural progenitors.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility peaks between the 0-10-somite stages (≈10–16 hpf).  
   • Signal falls modestly by 15-somites and is noticeably lower by 30-somites/24 hpf in nearly every lineage, indicating that the cis-elements in this cluster act primarily during early patterning rather than during organ maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest log-accessibility)  
   • Notochord (9.47 → 8.17)  
   • Floor-plate / neural floor-plate (8.9–9.2)  
   • Midbrain–hindbrain boundary & hindbrain neuroepithelium (≈9.3)  
   • Early differentiating neurons along the dorsal neural tube (≈9.1)  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors & presomitic mesoderm show moderate signal (≈7) that disappears after 30-somites.  
   → The pattern pinpoints the axial midline (notochord + floor-plate) and adjacent neural progenitors of the posterior/anterior hind-brain as the principal cell populations using these elements.

3. Biological processes regulated  
   Gene and motif content is heavily enriched for:  
   • A-P patterning and rhombomere identity – multitude of Hox (b1-b8, c6/8/9/10/11/13, d9/10/11/12/13) plus cofactors Pbx/Meis and Cdx.  
   • D/V midline specification – Foxa2/Foxa, Nkx2.2/2.4, Lhx3/4, Shh pathway targets, floor-plate markers.  
   • Notochord-derived signalling & early neurogenesis – Wnt1/3a/7a/7b/9a, Fgf, Eph/Ephrin genes, Sox2/3, Otx, Pax2/3/6, Irx, Lhx, Uncx.  
   Collectively, the cluster marks enhancers that coordinate axial midline formation, hind-brain segmentation and the first wave of neuronal differentiation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & expressed TFs)  
   • Forkhead: Foxa2/FoxA, Foxd3/d5, Foxb1/b2 – classic floor-plate/notochord activators.  
   • Hox–Pbx–Meis combinatorial code – confers rhombomere and trunk identity.  
   • SoxB (Sox2/3/11) and Sox10 – maintain neural progenitor competence.  
   • Nkx homeodomain factors (Nkx2.2/2.4/2.5/6) – ventral neural tube specification.  
   • Lhx/Lbx/Tlx family – interneuron subtype specification.  
   • Cdx & T-box (T/Bra, Tbx16) – link posterior axial extension to this program.  
   • Minor contributors: IRX, PAX, TEAD/Yes-associated motifs, E2F (cell-cycle active progenitors).

In summary, peak cluster 17_9 represents a set of enhancers that turn on just after gastrulation, stay highly accessible while the notochord, floor-plate and hind-brain are being patterned, and then shut down as these structures differentiate. The regulatory logic is dominated by Forkhead and Hox/Pbx/Meis factors, with support from Sox and Nkx families, orchestrating early axial midline formation and neural regionalisation.
]

## Cluster 18_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 18_0 represents a set of regulatory elements that are highly and selectively open in secretory / endoderm-derived glandular lineages, most conspicuously the zebrafish hatching-gland and, to a lesser extent, the nascent endocrine pancreas.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0–5-somite embryos (10–11 hpf) and reaches a maximum at ~10 somites (≈14 hpf) – e.g. hatching_gland_10 som = 27.9, endocrine_pancreas_10 som = 3.27 – before gradually declining but remaining above background through 24 hpf (30 somites).  
   • The pattern fits the known birth–maturation window of hatching-gland cells (specify & secrete chorionases by 14 hpf) and of first-wave endocrine pancreatic precursors (specify 12-18 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest pseudobulk signal)  
   • Hatching-gland cells ≫ endocrine pancreas > general endoderm (gut tube) > scattered low signal in other tissues.  
   • Somitic mesoderm, neuroectoderm, muscle etc. stay near basal (~0.8–1.3) while hatching-gland values are >18-fold higher, underscoring lineage specificity.

3. Inferred regulatory programme / biological processes  
   • Endodermal secretory differentiation: genes such as pdx1, hnf4a, one-cut, gata6/4/5, tgfb2, angpt1, slit2 point to maturation of secretory epithelia.  
   • Protein secretion & extracellular-matrix remodelling required for chorion digestion (hatching-gland) and hormone/peptide release (pancreas).  
   • Vascular / basement-membrane interaction (lama2, vldlr, angpt1) suggests preparation of a perfused endocrine niche.  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif over-representation & factor mapping)  
   • GATA family (gata3/4/5/6): canonical activators of endoderm & glandular genes – strongest motif block (cluster row 18).  
   • FOXA/Fox (foxa1/2, foxd3/5, foxf2): pioneer factors that open endoderm chromatin and licence pancreatic & hatching-gland programmes.  
   • HNF/HNF4 (hnf4a, hnf1, onecut) and nuclear-receptor cluster (RXR/RAR/NR2F, motif rows 11, 26, 31) – regulators of metabolic / secretory gene sets.  
   • PDX1/Onecut / PBX-MEIS homeobox factors – pancreas-specific enhancers.  
   • SOX factors (sox3/17/32) likely cooperatively maintain endoderm identity.  

In sum, peak-cluster 18_0 demarcates an early-to-mid-somite, endoderm-glandular chromatin programme powered by GATA-FOX pioneer activity and reinforced by HNF4/PBX/PDX-like factors, driving differentiation of the hatching-gland and the first endocrine pancreatic cells.

## Cluster 18_1

[*assistant*:
Biological synopsis of peak-cluster 18_1  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already detectable at the onset of segmentation (0 som) but rises sharply between 5–10 somites, reaches its maximum at 10 somites, and gradually declines after 20 somites.  
• This wave therefore coincides with the major window in which secretory organs and early glandular derivatives start to differentiate (≈13–16 hpf).  

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest chromatin openness is seen in –  
• Hatching-gland precursors/cells (extreme values: 18–24 a.u. from 0–15 som).  
• Endocrine-pancreas cells (∼5.7 → 7.1 a.u. at 0–10 som; remains elevated thereafter).  
Additional but moderate accessibility is present in floor-plate, differentiating neurons, tail-bud (definitive-endoderm/DFC cluster at 5 som) and generic mesodermal pseudobulks, pointing to a broadly shared programme that is most strongly amplified in secretory epithelial lineages.  

3. Suggested regulatory/biological programme  
Gene content (adamts17, adamtsl3, bmp16, dnah7, cfap99, cadps2, rab26, rims1/3, syt9, piezo1/2, rock1/2, vegfab, wasl) and the GO terms these genes usually map to indicate a convergence on:  
• Formation of an apico-secretory machinery – vesicle docking, Ca²⁺-regulated exocytosis, Rab/Rim/Syt network.  
• Extracellular-matrix remodelling (ADAMTS proteases) and tissue invasion/removal (required for hatching-gland function).  
• Ciliogenesis/centrosome and cytoskeletal organisation (dnah7, cfap genes, RFX-motifs).  
Taken together, cluster 18_1 marks a “secretory-gland/ciliated-epithelium” module that equips emerging glandular cells (hatching gland, endocrine islets) – and to a lower degree other epithelia – with the hardware for high-capacity secretion and luminal remodelling.  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment and motif-to-factor links highlight four TF families that can account for the observed pattern:  
• RFX family (RFX6, RFX4, RFX2/3): classical activators of ciliogenesis and of endocrine-pancreas genes; motifs highly over-represented.  
• GATA factors (Gata3/4/5/6, Tal1/2 partnership): endoderm-derived secretory fate and hatching-gland specification.  
• PAX6/2/8 and RFX-co-factor PAX-pairing: essential for endocrine-pancreas and hatching-gland gene batteries.  
• E2F/FOXM1 cell-cycle–cilia switch regulators: cooperate with RFX during centriole licensing and early epithelial maturation.  
Supporting but secondary contributors include HOX/MSX/DLX homeobox factors (regional identity) and SREBF/ATF-family bZIP factors (lipid biosynthesis for membranes).  

In summary, peak-cluster 18_1 represents a temporally constrained, gland/secretory-biased chromatin programme peaking at 10 somites and driven chiefly by RFX-, GATA- and PAX-family transcription factors to orchestrate ciliogenesis, vesicle trafficking and ECM-remodelling genes in hatching-gland and endocrine-pancreas progenitors.

## Cluster 18_2

[*assistant*:
Peak Cluster 18_2 – concise biological interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility sharply rises as soon as segmentation begins and peaks between 5-10 somites (≈11–15 hpf).  
• It remains high up to 15 somites and then steadily falls by 20–30 somites (≈22–24 hpf).  

2. Cell-type specificity (values are log-counts from the pseudo-bulk table)  
• Hatching-gland cells: extraordinary signal (34–47 at 0–15 somites; >10-fold above background) – the highest of any lineage.  
• Endocrine-pancreas cells: strong but lower signal (≈7–9 at 5–10 somites).  
• Broad endoderm (gut/endocrine primordia) shows intermediate accessibility (≈4–6).  
• All mesodermal, neural and somitic lineages remain near baseline (≈3).  

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
• Gene set and motif enrichment are dominated by GATA family targets (gata3, gata4, gata5, gata6, gata2a/b, gata1a/b) together with Tal1/2 and Trps1 – a canonical GRN for ventral fore-gut / pharyngeal endoderm.  
• Biological processes likely controlled:  
  – Early differentiation of the hatching-gland epithelium (chymotrypsin-rich, secretory) situated in the anterior endoderm.  
  – Onset of endocrine-pancreas specification and maturation (Gata4/6 cooperate with Pdx1, Tal1 etc.).  
  – General maturation of ventral fore-gut endoderm (genes for secretory pathway, ECM, lipid metabolism – e.g. GUCY1A2, MAN1C1, OSBP2, CDH18, TENM2).  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Highest motif z-scores and TF-mapping point to:  
• GATA family – Gata3, Gata4, Gata5, Gata6 (pioneer activity and endoderm identity).  
• TAL/TCF-E proteins – Tal1, Tal2 (co-operate with GATA factors in secretory/endocrine lineages).  
• Trps1 (GATA-like zinc-finger, enriched in pharyngeal epithelium).  
Secondary contributors (moderate enrichment):  
• FOXA/FOXF (open-chromatin facilitators in endoderm).  
• SOX17/32 (endodermal competence) – but with much lower motif scores than GATA.  

Summary  
Peak cluster 18_2 marks a GATA-driven regulatory module that is maximally open during early segmentation in the hatching-gland epithelium and ventral fore-gut/endocrine-pancreas endoderm. It likely contains enhancers that launch secretory/glandular gene programmes and initiate endocrine pancreas fate downstream of Gata-Tal cooperation.

## Cluster 18_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 18_3 captures the cis-regulatory program of the zebrafish hatching-gland / periderm secretory lineage.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0 som (≈10 hpf; 55 a.u.)  
   • It reaches its maximum at 10–15 som (≈14–18 hpf; 81–79 a.u.)—the window when hatching-gland cells fully differentiate and begin producing chorion-digesting enzymes.  
   • Accessibility declines thereafter (20 som ≈57 a.u.; 30 som ≈24 a.u.), consistent with the gland’s rapid functional maturation and subsequent quiescence.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • By far the strongest signal is in hatching_gland pseudobulks at every stage.  
   • Secondary, lower-level accessibility is seen in surface ectoderm/epidermis (particularly 30 som) and, to a much lesser extent, other secretory epithelia (endocrine pancreas, epidermal ionocytes), matching the common EVL/periderm origin.

3. Regulatory program inferred from associated genes  
   • Secretory granule biogenesis & regulated exocytosis: RAB26, RIMS2/3, CADPSa, ERC1, RAPGEF4, STX-related genes.  
   • Chorion-digestion enzyme production: he1.2 (classical hatching-enzyme marker).  
   • Vesicle membrane transport / ion homeostasis: ABCA4a, ATP2A3, ST6GAL2b, OMA1.  
   • Actin- and microtubule-based vesicle transport: MYO9aa, KIF13Bb, CORO2a.  
   • TGF-β signalling (Smad3a) and retinoid signalling (FAT4, RARB-motifs) that pattern the anterior ectoderm.  
   Together these genes point to a program that builds the lysosome-related secretory organelles and protease cargo required for embryo hatching.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
   Motif enrichment plus TF-mapping highlight:  
   • GATA family (gata3/2/4/5/6) – essential for hatching-gland specification and he1 gene activation.  
   • FOX family (foxa/foxf/foxi3) – regulators of ectodermal secretory cell fate.  
   • MiT/TFE bHLH-Zip factors (tfeb, tfec, tfe3a) – master regulators of lysosome/secretory-granule gene sets; matches the strong secretory signature.  
   • AP-1/BATF/JUN and ATF/CREB factors – support high secretory and stress-responsive transcription.  
   • Nuclear-receptor cluster (RAR/RXR/NR2F/ESRR) – consistent with retinoic-acid dependence of anterior periderm derivatives.

In sum, peak-cluster 18_3 marks enhancers that turn on just before and during segmentation in hatching-gland cells, are driven primarily by GATA-, FOX- and MiT/TFE-family TFs, and coordinate the secretory/enzymatic machinery that allows the embryo to break the chorion at 2 dpf.
]

## Cluster 18_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 18_4 encodes a “glandular / secretory endoderm” chromatin programme that is switched on transiently during mid-somite stages.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility starts to rise at the 5 somite stage (≈11 hpf), peaks sharply at 10–15 somites (≈14–18 hpf) and declines again by 30 somites (24 hpf).  
   • The bell-shaped profile matches the period when hatching-gland cells mature and when the first endocrine-pancreatic buds differentiate.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest average accessibility)  
   1. Hatching-gland cells – very strong signal (≈42 at 0 som, up to 61 at 15 som).  
   2. Endocrine-pancreas precursors – moderate but consistent signal (≈10 → 16 → 15).  
   3. General endoderm – gradual increase across time (≈6 → 16).  
   Other tissues show only low basal values (≈3-5).

3. Inferred biological processes  
   Gene set is enriched for proteins involved in:  
   • Regulated secretion / vesicle trafficking (sytl4, hid1b, dgkg, furina, gabbr2, sri, tomm70a).  
   • Ca2+ / calmodulin signalling (camk1b, camk2d1, camkk1a, micu1).  
   • Protease and extracellular-matrix processing important for chorionase release and islet morphogenesis (capn5/8/9, cemip, col12/14, ltbp1).  
   • Endodermal differentiation and ER/mitochondrial metabolism (pdcp, lonp2, soat1, tpk1).  
   Taken together, the cluster marks cells that are acquiring an exocrine/endocrine secretory phenotype.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
   • GATA family (Gata4/5/6, Gata1/2/3) – canonical endoderm and gland specification factors.  
   • FOX-A/FOX-I/FOX-C (Foxa1/2/3, Foxi1/3) – pioneer factors that open endodermal chromatin and drive secretory gene networks.  
   • NKX2-1/2-4 (thyroid & hatching-gland regulators) and PDX1 (early pancreatic buds) – consistent with the two major high-accessibility cell types.  
   • ONECUT / PBX-MEIS co-motifs – often cooperate with Pdx1 and Gata in pancreas and liver enhancers.  
   • MEF2 / SRF and bZIP (ATF/CREB, BATF) motifs – support calcium-dependent secretory and stress-responsive genes.

In summary, peak-cluster 18_4 delineates a transient secretory-endoderm enhancer set, maximally active in hatching-gland cells and budding endocrine-pancreas about 14–18 hpf, governed primarily by GATA-FOX-NKX/PDX1 transcription-factor modules.
]

## Cluster 18_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 18_5 highlights a short-lived, highly tissue-restricted regulatory program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises sharply between the 5- and 15-somite stages (≈12–18 hpf).  
   • It peaks at ~10–15 somites and falls markedly by 30 somites (≈24 hpf) in every cell type that shows activity.  
   ⇒ The module is therefore active during late segmentation and is already being shut down at the start of organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest → lower)  
   • Hatching-gland cells (chorionase gland): extremely high signal (40–60 a.u.).  
   • Fast-twitch muscle precursors: consistently high (14–18 a.u.).  
   • Endocrine-pancreas progenitors (islet cells) and general endoderm: strong (10–16 a.u.).  
   • Moderate signal in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and neuromuscular progenitors; low elsewhere.

3. Biological program inferred  
   The three cell types share two needs: (i) rapid epithelial/secretory maturation and (ii) ECM remodelling/attachment during tissue morphogenesis.  
   – Associated genes in the cluster include structural/secretory or signalling factors (alcama, ltbp1, fbn2b, cps1, spns2, gpc3, hp, wnt2ba, eya1), matching those functions.  
   – Together with the temporal profile, the cluster most likely encodes an “early secretory/endoderm-plus-muscle” module that prepares hatching-gland cells to secrete chorionases, enables endocrine-pancreas precursors to adopt hormone-secreting identity, and supports fast-muscle fibre maturation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and TF lists point to:  
   • GATA family (Gata3/4/5/6, Gata1/2) – canonical endoderm and hatching-gland regulators; explains very high HG and pancreas signal.  
   • bHLH/NeuroD + Atoh/Neurog (Neurod1/4, Neurog3, Atoh1/7) – endocrine-pancreas and neuro-secretory differentiation.  
   • MEF2 / SRF (Mef2a/b/c/d, Srf) – fast-muscle maturation.  
   • NFAT and bZIP (Atf/Creb/Batf) – transient secretory-cell activation.  
   • Additional support from HOX/PKNOX-PBX and FOX classes, consistent with regional identity cues but secondary to the core GATA–bHLH–MEF2 triad.

In sum, peak-cluster 18_5 demarcates a GATA-centred regulatory module that is transiently opened during late segmentation to drive hatching-gland differentiation, endocrine-pancreas/islet formation and early fast-muscle maturation, then becomes largely inaccessible as these tissues progress into full organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 18_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 18_6 captures an “early-foregut/endoderm – hatching-gland” regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility peaks at the very beginning of segmentation (0-10 somites ≈ 10–14 hpf, max ≈ 89 a.u. at 10 somites).  
   • It wanes rapidly thereafter (≈ 56 at 20 somites, ≈ 20 at 30 somites), in line with the fact that hatching-gland cells are functional only until the embryo escapes the chorion (~24 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • By far the highest signal is in hatching-gland pseudobulks (80–90 a.u.).  
   • Second-tier accessibility is seen in related anterior endoderm derivatives: endocrine-pancreas (15–25 a.u.) and general endoderm (11–16 a.u.).  
   • Other tissues show only basal levels (<10 a.u.).

3. Likely biological programme  
   • Genes linked to the peaks (Pdx1, Gata4/5/6, Foxa1/2, Hnf4a/g, Otx2a, Six3b, Lhx5, Sulf1, Ugcg, Ot(x)/Six homeoboxes, secretory pathway genes) point to anterior foregut specification, maturation of secretory epithelium and production of hatching enzymes.  
   • The same transcriptional circuitry seeds endocrine-pancreas development, explaining the moderate accessibility there.  
   • Pathways implicated: endoderm morphogenesis, foregut organogenesis, secretory/exocrine vesicle trafficking, retinoic- and thyroid-hormone signalling (thrab, rarga/b motifs).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched in the cluster)  
   • GATA family (Gata3/4/5/6, Tal1/2) – endoderm & gland differentiation.  
   • FOX pioneer factors (Foxa1/2, Foxd3/5, Foxi, Foxq1) – open chromatin for foregut genes.  
   • SOX factors (Sox17/32/2/3) – early endoderm competence.  
   • PDX1 & Onecut/Meis/Pbx combinations – pancreas/hatching-gland gene activation.  
   • Nuclear receptors (RAR, RXR, THR) – retinoic & thyroid cues that trigger hatching-gland maturation.  
   • Minor contributors: ETS (Elf/Etv) and KLF/NRF motifs linked to secretory and stress-response genes.

Summary: Cluster 18_6 marks a short-lived but intense chromatin-accessibility wave in hatching-gland cells during 0–15-somite stages, driven by GATA-FOX-SOX pioneer activity and foregut/pancreatic TFs (PDX1, Onecut, Meis/Pbx). It programs anterior endoderm derivatives for secretory function—first for chorion-dissolving enzyme release (hatching) and later for endocrine-pancreas priming.
]

## Cluster 18_7

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 18_7 marks an early‐endoderm / secretory-lineage chromatin program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at 0 somites (~10 hpf), peaks between 10–15 somites (≈14–17 hpf), and then progressively declines (marked drop by 30 somites / 24 hpf).  
• The sharp fall in hatching-gland accessibility after 20 somites underscores that this program is most important during the gastrula–early-organogenesis window.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest to lowest)  
• Hatching-gland cells (>100 a.u. at 0–15 somites) – by far the dominant signal.  
• Endocrine-pancreas progenitors (~30–37 a.u.).  
• General endoderm (gut tube) and early somites (≈23–25 a.u.).  
• Most other lineages show only basal accessibility (≈10–15 a.u.).

3. Regulatory/biological program inferred  
• Specification and terminal differentiation of anterior endoderm-derived secretory cells:  
  – Hatching-gland enzyme-secreting cells (choriolysin production, chorion rupture).  
  – Pancreatic endocrine precursors (islet cell priming).  
• Concurrent activation of genes involved in secretory/exocytotic function (spdef, prdm1a, hnf1/4, rxr), epithelial maturation (grhl3, tp63), and early metabolic/homeostatic genes (pd x1, hnf-family).  
• Moderate activity in forming somites suggests a shared GATA/FOXA chromatin state present in early mesendoderm before lineage segregation.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
Motif enrichment together with correlated gene expression highlights:  
• GATA factors – Gata4/5/6/Gata3 (most significantly enriched; canonical for endoderm & hatching-gland).  
• PDX1 (+ PBX/MEIS cofactors) – central to pancreatic endocrine identity.  
• FOXA/FOXC family – pioneer factors opening endoderm chromatin.  
• ONECUT / HNF1 & HNF4 nuclear receptors – liver/pancreas secretory programs.  
• SPDEF & PRDM1a – promote secretory cell maturation, prominent in hatching-gland.  
• SOX family (Sox17/32, Sox9) – early mesendoderm competence.  

Together, cluster 18_7 captures an early, GATA- and PDX1-centred regulatory module that builds the chromatin foundation for zebrafish hatching-gland cells and the nascent endocrine pancreas during 10–20 somite stages.
]

## Cluster 18_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 18_8 represents a very distinctive, endoderm-derived “secretory-gland” programme that flares up briefly during early segmentation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0-somites (≈11–12 hpf) and reaches its apex between 10–15 somites (≈14–18 hpf).  
   • It falls steeply after 20 somites and is largely shut down by 30 somites (>24 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Hatching-gland cells dominate (25–30 arbitrary units vs. 3–8 in other lineages), indicating that these peaks mark regulatory DNA used almost exclusively by the hatching-gland epithelium.  
   • Moderate accessibility in endocrine-pancreatic precursors and general endoderm suggests re-deployment of the same cis-elements in related secretory cell types.

3. Regulatory programme / biology  
   • Associated genes encode secretory-pathway components, glycosylation enzymes (Muc13, Galnt, St6galnac), lysosomal / protease machinery (Ctsl, Atp6v0a subunits), lipid-handling proteins (Abca2/3, Slc30a8, Pnpla2) and transcriptional regulators of anterior endoderm (Pdx1, Hnf1, Hnf4, Onecut, Rx, Ptf1a).  
   • Together they fit the known role of the hatching-gland: a transient anterior endodermal gland that synthesises and secretes chorion-digesting proteases and mucins, and share elements with nascent endocrine pancreas.  
   • Thus cluster 18_8 captures the transcriptional and chromatin programme for “early secretory-gland differentiation from anterior endoderm”.

4. Key transcription factors (motifs highly enriched in this cluster)  
   • GATA family (Gata3/4/5/6) – classic drivers of anterior endoderm and gland specification; highest motif z-scores (M04453 series).  
   • FOX factors (FoxA/FoxL/FoxP/K) – pioneer factors that open endodermal enhancers; several Fox motifs (M04454, M05656 block) rank in the top percentile.  
   • Onecut / HNF (Hnf4a, Hnf1b) and Nuclear-receptor motifs (RXR/RAR, NR2F/COUP-TF) – matching the secretory and metabolic gene set.  
   • PDX1 / PBX-PKNOX homeobox class and MEIS – consistent with pancreatic/hatching-gland enhancers.  
   • MEF2 and E2F motifs appear as secondary peaks, reflecting the burst of proliferation that precedes terminal differentiation.

Taken together, peak-cluster 18_8 marks enhancers that are transiently opened in the hatching-gland epithelium during 10–15-somite stages (and reused at lower level in pancreatic/endoderm cells), driven primarily by GATA-FOX-HNF/Onecut transcriptional circuitry that establishes an early secretory-gland phenotype.
]

## Cluster 18_9

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 18_9 marks a set of regulatory regions that turn on very early, peak around the 10-15-somite stage and then shut down as organogenesis proceeds.  
Below is a succinct biological read-out.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0 som (10 hpf), reaches a maximum at 10–15 som (≈14–17 hpf), and steadily falls by 30 som (≈24 hpf).  
   • The early-peak/early-decay profile is typical of specification rather than late differentiation enhancers.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   1. Hatching-gland cells – by far the strongest signal (80–95 arbitrary units at 0–15 som).  
   2. Endocrine-pancreas progenitors – 25–33 units with the same temporal peak.  
   3. General endoderm (gut-tube) and early somites show a moderate signal but are well below the hatching-gland plateau.

3. Likely biological program  
   • “Secretory/epithelial endoderm” gene set: the associated genes include he1.2 (hatching-enzyme), foxa3, hnf4a, gata4/5/6, insra, pcsk2, cpne8, etc.—all characteristic of anterior fore-gut derivatives (liver/pancreas) and the hatching gland (a specialised secretory epithelium).  
   • Pathways inferred: establishment of secretory machinery, ECM remodelling and glycosylation (many collagen, glycosyl-transferase, lipid-metabolism genes).  
   • Thus the cluster probably contains enhancers that prime secretory fore-gut organs and the zebrafish-specific hatching-gland epithelium.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment plus presence of the TF transcripts in the same cells converge on:  
   • GATA family (Gata3/4/5/6; motif group 18) – canonical for endoderm/hatching-gland lineage.  
   • FOXA pioneers (Foxa1/Foxa3; motif groups 2/3/68/107) – open chromatin in gut and pancreas primordia.  
   • HNF4 (Hnf4a/g; nuclear-receptor motif groups 11/31/55/57) – activates gut and pancreas metabolic genes.  
   • PDX1 and PBX/MEIS co-factors (motif groups 4, 28, 92) – essential for pancreatic endocrine identity.  
   • NR2F/COUP-TF and NR5A (liver-organ TFs) appear as co-enriched nuclear-receptor motifs, supporting a broad fore-gut program.

Taken together, cluster 18_9 represents an early endodermal/hatching-gland enhancer module powered mainly by GATA-FOXA-HNF4 (with PDX1/PBX-MEIS assistance) that primes secretory epithelial lineages before organ maturation.
]

## Cluster 18_10

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 18_10 corresponds to a small set of regulatory regions that “switch on” very early in segmentation and are essentially restricted to the hatching-gland lineage with a subsidiary signal in the incipient endocrine pancreas/fore-gut endoderm.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at 0-somite (~10 hpf) embryos, peaks between 10- and 15-somite stages (≈14–16 hpf) and starts to wane by 20–30 somites (≈19–24 hpf).  
• The profile therefore tracks the short developmental window in which hatching-gland cells differentiate and in which first pancreatic endocrine progenitors become specified.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest to lowest)  
• Hatching-gland cells: extraordinary enrichment (56–66 logCPM), an order of magnitude above all other pseudobulks.  
• Endocrine-pancreas progenitors: moderate–high signal (≈15–22 logCPM) exactly at the same time window.  
• Weak/ background accessibility in general endoderm, floor-plate and muscle/PSM derivatives (≈6–8 logCPM).

3. Implied regulatory programme  
The gene and motif content point to an “anterior ventral secretory organ” programme that is shared by hatching-gland cells (chorion gland) and early fore-gut/pancreatic endocrine progenitors.  Functions likely regulated include:  
• induction and maintenance of secretory epithelial identity (protease/lysosomal genes, exocrine enzymes)  
• retinoic-acid–driven anterior fore-gut patterning  
• early endocrine competence (pdx1, nkx2/4, gata4/6, foxa/f)  
• terminal hatching-gland differentiation (irx/otx/barhl factors known to mark this lineage).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (top enriched motif families & matching zebrafish factors)  
• GATA family – gata3/4/5/6 (high motif scores, correlated genes); gatekeep early fore-gut and pancreatic/hatching-gland fate.  
• Forkhead (FOX) factors – foxa1/2/3, foxf1/2, foxi3; open “pioneer” chromatin in endoderm-derived secretory cells.  
• IRX / BarH / Otx & homeobox cluster (irx1/3/7, barhl1/2, otx1/2) – characteristic for hatching-gland specification.  
• PDX1 and NKX2 family motifs (nkx2-1/4/5) – hallmark of early pancreatic endocrine and hatching-gland enhancers.  
• Nuclear receptors RAR/RXR/COUP-TF (rarga/b, rxraa/b, nr2f1/2) – consistent with strong retinoic-acid dependence of anterior endoderm tissues.  
Secondary but notable: SOX (sox2/3/5/19), E2F/FOXM1 (transient proliferation phase).

In summary, peak-cluster 18_10 represents an early, transient enhancer set that drives the anterior-ventral secretory-organ programme, peaking in hatching-gland cells and partially reused in nascent endocrine-pancreas progenitors, orchestrated by GATA–FOX–homeobox (IRX/BarH/PDX) and retinoid-receptor transcription factor axes.
]

## Cluster 18_11

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 18_11 captures an early, gland–associated regulatory program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0-somite (≈10 hpf), reaches a maximum at 10–15 somites (≈14–17 hpf), and collapses by 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • This “burst-and-fade” profile matches the short functional window of the hatching-gland and the onset of early endocrine pancreas activity.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest values)  
   • Hatching-gland cells: 15–21 (vs. background ≈2) at 0–20 somites, falling to <1 by 30 somites.  
   • Endocrine-pancreas precursors: 4–5 across 0–20 somites.  
   • Optic-cup epithelium: 4–4.8 at 0–20 somites.  
   • All other lineages remain near baseline (≈2).  
   ⇒ The cluster is essentially “on” in the hatching gland and, to a lesser extent, in developing secretory epithelia of the pancreas and eye.

3. Biological/functional program  
   Associated genes are heavily enriched for:  
   • Secreted or vesicle-trafficking proteins (RIMS2/3, SNAP91, SLC30A8, CPE, CPEB4).  
   • Extracellular-matrix and protease components (COL7A1, FBLN1, FREM2, GAA, HK2).  
   • Ion channels and GPCRs typical of hormone-secreting cells (KCNB2, KCNIP4, GRM7, GPCRs).  
   • Developmental regulators of anterior endoderm / pre-placodal derivatives (GSC, PITX, PAX, HNF genes).  
   Together these point to a program that equips early secretory glands (hatching gland protease secretion, nascent β-like endocrine cells, retinal pigment epithelium) with the machinery for high exocytotic output and ECM remodeling.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs with strongest enrichment)  
   • GATA family (Gata3/4/5/6) – central for hatching-gland specification and pancreas primordium.  
   • Forkhead factors (FoxA1/2/3, FoxD3, FoxL1) – pioneer activity in endoderm-derived secretory tissues.  
   • Sox family (Sox2/3/19, Sox4/8) – early epithelial/placodal competence.  
   • Pax6 / Pax2 / Pax8 – eye field and endocrine-pancreas differentiation.  
   • Nuclear receptors Hnf4, Nr2f (COUP-TF), RAR/RXR – metabolic and secretory gene activation.  

In summary, peak cluster 18_11 marks an early, transient chromatin program that is most active in the hatching gland and, secondarily, in developing endocrine pancreas and optic cup, driven primarily by GATA and Forkhead pioneers together with Sox and Pax factors to activate secretory-epithelium gene expression.

## Cluster 18_12

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 18_12 – concise biological interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises sharply at the start of somitogenesis (0–5 somites, 10–12 hpf), reaches a maximum around 10–15 somites (≈14–17 hpf), and collapses by 30 somites (24 hpf).  
• The “wave-like” profile (16–24 a.u. in early stages → ~1 a.u. at 30 somites) points to an early, transient regulatory program.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest pseudobulk values)  
• Hatching-gland epithelium is by far the top scorer (16.9–24.3 versus baseline 2–5), indicating that these peaks are hallmark enhancers of this specialised secretory tissue.  
• Secondary but clear accessibility in:  
  – Early endocrine-pancreas progenitors (~5–6)  
  – Neural-crest derivatives and superficial endoderm (~5)  
  – Modest signal in general endoderm and differentiating neurons (~3–4)  
The pattern suggests a programme shared by ventral/anterior ectoderm-derived secretory cells and early glandular/endocrine lineages.

3. Likely biological processes controlled  
Gene set and enriched GO terms (secretory vesicle components – cadps2, hid1, rab/raf family; ECM & adhesion – cdh24a, acana; hormone/peptide processing – ghrh, insrb; neuro-secretory markers – th, nlgn1, nrxn2, map2) indicate:  
• Differentiation of enzyme-secreting/glandular cells (hatching-gland chorionases, early endocrine pancreas).  
• Assembly of the secretory apparatus, vesicle trafficking and exocytosis.  
• Acquisition of neuro-endocrine features (peptide hormone & neurotransmitter synthesis genes).  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & lineage context)  
• GATA cluster (gata3/4/5/6, gata2a/b) – canonical activators of hatching-gland and foregut/endocrine fates.  
• FOX/FOXI (foxi3a/b, foxj1, foxl1, foxa) – ventral ectoderm and secretory epithelial identity.  
• PAX / IRX (pax2/8, irx1/3/7) – anterior ectodermal patterning, hatching-gland competence.  
• DLX / BARX / MSX – reinforce ventral cranial ectoderm and secretory differentiation.  
• ONECUT & RFX family – support ciliogenesis/secretory vesicle gene expression.  
• E2F & KDM2 motifs present but likely reflect proliferative burst preceding maturation.

Summary: Peak-cluster 18_12 represents a transient enhancer set that is switched on during early somitogenesis in the hatching-gland epithelium (and to a lesser extent in emerging endocrine-pancreas and neural-crest secretory derivatives) to drive a GATA/FOXI-centred transcriptional programme required for secretory-gland differentiation and high-level vesicle/exocytosis function.

## Cluster 19_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19_0 represents a set of regulatory regions that behave like “constitutive promoters” – short, GC-rich loci that are open almost everywhere and all the time.  Below is a terse interpretation drawn from the four data layers.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at the earliest sample (0-somite, 10 hpf) and remains essentially unchanged through 30-somite (≈ 24 hpf).  
• No clear wave-like rise or fall is seen; values fluctuate only ±10 %.  
⇒ The loci are developmentally stable and are not linked to a specific stage transition.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• Nearly every lineage (NMP, paraxial mesoderm, endoderm, neural, heart, pancreas, blood, muscle, etc.) shows accessibility scores around 2.8–3.3.  
• The few low or zero values coincide with cell types that have very few nuclei in our dataset (sporadic zeros in epidermis 30 som, floor-plate 30 som, tail-bud 30 som) rather than a true biological shut-down.  
⇒ 19_0 is broadly accessible; no lineage-restricted pattern emerges.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
• The associated-gene list is enormous and heavily enriched for housekeeping functions: ribosomal proteins, RNA-processing factors, core metabolic enzymes, vesicle-traffic genes, cell-cycle regulators, etc.  
• GO/KEGG terms (quick enrichment on the gene list) are dominated by “translation”, “oxidative phosphorylation”, “cell-cycle”, “mRNA splicing”, “protein transport”.  
• The lack of tissue-specific bias and the prevalence of core-cellular genes argue that these peaks are canonical promoters/first introns used for basal transcription across the embryo.

4. Key transcription-factor signals  
Motif Z-scores are uniformly modest (< 0.2), consistent with GC-rich promoter sequence rather than enhancer composition.  Slight positive enrichment is seen for:  
• SP/KLF family (KLF6/7/13, SP1/2) – generic GC-box binding.  
• NF-Y/YY1/CTCF – promoter–architectural factors.  
• E2F and MCM-related sites – cell-cycle–linked transcription.  
• NRF/NR1H/NR2F orphan-nuclear-receptor motifs – ubiquitous metabolic control.  

Taken together, cluster 19_0 likely marks core promoters (and a minority of first introns/CGIs) that drive baseline, housekeeping transcription needed in virtually every embryonic cell.  It does not delineate a lineage-specific regulatory programme but instead underpins the fundamental metabolic and biosynthetic capacity of the developing zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 19_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19_1 marks a small set of regulatory regions that “flash” open at two very specific developmental moments and locations.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • First peak: 10-somite stage (~14 hpf).  
   • Second peak: 30-somite stage (~24 hpf).  
   Outside of these windows accessibility hovers at basal background (~2).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • 10-somite Midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) – 34.9 (strongest signal in the whole atlas).  
   • 30-somite Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) – 26.8 (second strongest).  
   Moderate but much lower signals are seen in endocrine-pancreas and fast-muscle pseudobulks; most other cell types remain at baseline.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   Convergent evidence (cell types, time points, associated genes and motif spectrum) points to a Retinoic-acid (RA) / nuclear-receptor driven A-P patterning module.  
   • Biology at 10-somites: RA emanating from paraxial mesoderm patterns the anterior neural plate and establishes the MHB organiser.  
   • Biology at 30-somites: the same RA gradient, now posteriorly shifted, refines rostro-caudal identity in the posterior PSM and maturing somites.  
   • Associated-gene catalogue is packed with classic RA-responsive loci (Hox A/B/C/D clusters, pbx/meis co-factors, nr2f/co-up TFs, rarb/rarga, rxr genes) plus segmentation/neurulation players (en, pax2/5/8, otx/gbx, mesp, tbx, runx).  
   • The transient accessibility therefore likely corresponds to RA-response enhancers that switch on “stripe” and boundary genes during hindbrain and trunk segmentation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs enriched and present in gene list)  
   • RAR/RXR heterodimers: rarga, rargb, raraa/b, rxraa/b, rxrba/b.  
   • COUP-TF / NR2F family (nr2f1/2/5/6) – known RA-responsive modulators.  
   • PBX–MEIS–HOX code: extensive Hox motifs plus pbx1/3/4 and meis1/2/3 suggest cooperative binding.  
   • KDM2B/CXXC module (direct “kdm2ba” hit) – chromatin reader that facilitates long-range RA-driven enhancer activation.  
   • Additional supporting motifs: NR4A (nr4a1/2/3) and ROR family (rorab/rorcb) that frequently co-occupy RA enhancers.

In short, peak-cluster 19_1 represents a set of RA-responsive enhancers that open briefly in the MHB at 10 somites and again in posterior PSM at 30 somites to drive Hox/Pbx/Meis-mediated anterior-posterior patterning of the neuro-mesodermal axis.
]

## Cluster 19_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19 _2 behaves like a “constitutive-promoter” module that becomes briefly super-accessible in primordial germ cells (PGCs).

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Low-to-moderate accessibility is already present at 0–5-somite stages but  
   • a sharp spike occurs at 10–15 somites (≈14–18 hpf) and subsides again by 20–30 somites.  

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest signal: primordial germ cells (3 → 35 → 47-fold increase at 5 → 10 → 15 somites).  
   • Basal but uniform accessibility in most embryonic lineages (neural ectoderm, endoderm, paraxial mesoderm, epidermis, vasculature).  
   • Near-background in early fast-muscle and hatching-gland pseudobulks.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Peak set overlaps promoters of many large, CpG-rich, housekeeping / neuro-adhesion genes (e.g. CNTN1a, NRXN2, L1CAM-family, STXBP1b, RYR2, LPL).  
   • Functional themes:  
     – basic cellular metabolism and proteostasis (PSMD4, UBR1, SMARCA2, DNMT1 etc.)  
     – neuronal wiring / synaptic adhesion (CNTN, NRXN, NLGN--like, TENM, SHANK, RIMS genes)  
     – broad “house-keeping” proliferation programme that PGCs transiently hyper-activate during epigenetic reprogramming.  
   • Taken together, 19 _2 marks constitutively open, CpG-island promoters needed for general viability and, later, neuronal differentiation; its transient surge in PGCs likely reflects their genome-wide DNA-demethylation-driven open chromatin phase.

4. Key transcription-factor signatures  
   Motif enrichment is typical of ubiquitous promoter elements rather than lineage-restricted enhancers:  
   • CxxC/KDM2B axis (cluster 16 – direct hit kdm2ba / CXXC1/4/5) – binds unmethylated CpG islands and keeps them open.  
   • NF-Y/CCAAT and SP/KLF family (motif groups 8, 86, 106) – classical core-promoter TFs.  
   • E2F/TFDP (clusters 6, 13, 59) – cell-cycle–linked activation, matching high proliferation.  
   • General FOX/SOX family footprints (clusters 2, 3, 63, 68) consistent with broad embryonic expression.  
   • Minimal enrichment for lineage-specific drivers; instead a promoter-maintenance set that PGCs hyper-utilise.

In summary, peak-cluster 19 _2 represents a constitutively accessible promoter pool whose activity briefly surges in primordial germ cells during mid-somitogenesis, reflecting genome-wide promoter demethylation; otherwise it provides basal accessibility for housekeeping- and neuro-adhesion genes across the embryo, maintained by a generic promoter TF ensemble (CXXC/KDM2B, NF-Y, KLF/SP, E2F).
]

## Cluster 19_3

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 19_3 captures a short, sharp burst of chromatin opening that is restricted to the posterior growth zone of the embryo.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Virtually silent at gastrula/0-somite (10 hpf).  
   • Massive spike at 5- and 10-somite stages (≈ 12–14 hpf): tail-bud signal is 15–30-fold higher than any other sample.  
   • Accessibility collapses again by 15 somites and is negligible by 20–30 somites (18–24 hpf).  
   ⇒ The elements are active only during the brief window when the tail-bud is producing new axial tissue.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest accessibility: Tail-bud progenitors (posterior axial stem cell compartment).  
   • Minor/background signal in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP) and early presomitic mesoderm, but nowhere else.  
   • Other germ-layer derivatives show only baseline accessibility, indicating the cluster is posterior-specific rather than lineage-specific.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Associated genes and motifs are dominated by posterior patterning factors:  
   • Posterior Hox paralogs (Hox9-Hox13), Cdx1b/4.  
   • Axial/Tail transcription factors and signalling genes: Tbx15/16/18/19, Msx, Lhx, Nkx, Meox, Eve / Evx, Fgf18a, Ret, Rara/Rarg.  
   • Many chromatin/gene-regulatory genes (Kdm2, Dnmt1) consistent with stem-cell–like epigenetic state.  

   Together these point to enhancers that control:  
   • Posterior body-axis elongation and segmentation.  
   • Maintenance and proliferation of neuromesodermal/tail-bud stem cells.  
   • Progressive activation of posterior Hox code that confers trunk–tail identity.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
   Motif enrichment and gene set point to a HOX/CDX-centred network, helped by Fox and T-box factors:  
   • CDX (Cdx1b, Cdx4) – primary integrators of Wnt/FGF signals in the tail-bud.  
   • HOX9-13 paralogs – specifying increasingly posterior axial fates.  
   • T-box family (T/Brachyury, Tbx15/16/18) – promoting mesodermal fate and elongation.  
   • FOX factors (FoxC1/2, FoxF, FoxA) – chromatin pioneering and permissive activity.  
   • MSX / DLX / NKX homeobox proteins – segmentation boundary and neural crest inputs.  

   The cluster therefore represents a posterior-axis “enhancer set” that turns on briefly as the tail-bud generates new trunk and tail tissue, orchestrated by CDX/HOX activity and supported by FOX/TBX partners.

Concise interpretation: Peak cluster 19_3 marks tail-bud-specific regulatory elements that drive the CDX/HOX programme required for rapid posterior body-axis extension during the 5–10-somite window.
]

## Cluster 19_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19_4 corresponds to a set of regulatory elements that switch on very early in the eye-field/forebrain and are thereafter used broadly by differentiating neural derivatives.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• The strongest opening is already visible at the 0-somite stage (10 hpf); the neural-optic 0-somite pseudobulk shows a >20-fold higher signal than the bulk of other samples (33.2 vs. ~1.5).  
• Accessibility decays rapidly (0.17 at 5 som) but re-appears at modest levels from 15–30 somites (1.3-2.0), coinciding with retinal cup formation and onset of neuronal differentiation.  
→ Interpretation: an early “eye-field burst’’ followed by sustained but lower activity during retinal/neural maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Eye/optic lineages: neural_optic 0 som » neural_optic 20–30 som; optic-cup samples are the only ones with a dramatic spike.  
• Forebrain / mid-brain–hind-brain boundary and differentiating neurons show intermediate values (~1.7–2.1).  
• Virtually all non-neural or late mesoderm/endoderm samples remain at basal background (≲1).  
→ The cluster marks eye-field progenitors first, then a broader set of CNS neurons.

3. Regulatory programme encoded  
Gene set is enriched for:  
• Eye-field / early retinal TFs and patterning genes (rx1, rx3, otx1/2, six3/6, pax6a/b, lhx2, vsx1, vax1/2).  
• Neuronal adhesion & synaptogenesis molecules (ctnna2, cdh4, kirrel3, nlgn1, cntn3a, gabra6b, grin/gria, unc13b, rims1b).  
• Axon guidance / neurite extension (slit1b, slit2, sema3/4, plxnb3, pak6, rasgrf2b).  
• Photoreceptor/retina-specific channels and transporters (kcnh5b, kcnc1b, slc4a5, slc5a10, opn8a).  
Functional annotation therefore points to “eye-field specification → retinal neural differentiation → synapse formation”.

4. Likely transcription-factor drivers  
Motif-enrichment plus TF expression links the cluster to:  
• Eye-field “pioneer’’ factors Rx (RAX), Pax6, Six3/6, Lhx2, Otx1/2.  
• Forkhead family Foxg1, Foxi, Foxc (abundant motifs; forebrain/optic pioneers).  
• SoxB factors Sox2/3/19 (maintain neural competence).  
• Homeobox/Paired factors Vsx1, Vax1/2, Uncx.  
• Nuclear receptors for retinoic/thyroid signalling (Rxra/b, Rara/b, Nr2f family, Ror) – consistent with Vitamin-A-dependent eye induction.  
• MEF2/CREB/ATF and E2F motifs appear later, matching neuronal maturation and cell-cycle exit.

Overall, peak-cluster 19_4 represents early eye-field/forebrain enhancers that are first maximally accessible in optic progenitors at gastrulation–neurulation, and later reused in developing retinal and CNS neurons to drive genes required for neuronal connectivity and photoreceptor function.
]

## Cluster 19_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19_5 marks a set of regulatory elements that light up very transiently in the posterior growth zone of the embryo.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already elevated at 0-somite stage, surges further at 5 somites and reaches a sharp maximum at 10 somites (tail_bud_10 som = 72 a.u.).  
   • It falls steeply by 15–20 somites and is essentially silent by 30 somites.  
   → The cluster is therefore linked to the short window (∼10–14 hpf) when the tail-bud / posterior body axis is being generated most actively.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Tail-bud cells are the clear hotspot (38–72 a.u. versus ≈10 a.u. basal signal elsewhere).  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) and the most posterior presomitic mesoderm (PSM) show moderate signal, consistent with their location inside the tail-bud niche.  
   • Little or no enrichment is seen in differentiated tissues or anterior neural plate, confirming posterior restriction.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   Genes correlated with the peaks point toward posterior axial-extension processes:  
   – Patterning / signalling: Wnt7bb, Fzd6, Fgf23, Ptger1a, Gpc6a.  
   – Posterior Hox/Cdx co-factors: Pbx, Meis, Cdx1b/4 (present in motif-gene mapping).  
   – Cell motility & cytoskeleton: Raph1, Arhgap21b, Rhocb, Itga10, Capn3a.  
   – Lipid / energy metabolism needed for rapid proliferation: Scd, Suclg2, Acl-y, Cpt1ab.  
   Collectively these features fit the transcriptional network that keeps tail-bud progenitors proliferative, Wnt-/Fgf-responsive and competent to generate both mesoderm and spinal cord.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and mapping converge on:  
   • CDX homeobox factors (Cdx1b/4) – posterior identity, activate caudal Hox genes.  
   • HOX/PBX/MEIS combination – segmental patterning of nascent trunk-tail tissues.  
   • TCF/LEF (Wnt effectors) – consistent with high Wnt activity in tail-bud.  
   • SOX2/3/10 + Brachyury (ta) – maintain bipotent NMP state.  
   • E2F / FOXM1 – proliferative drive of tail-bud stem zone.

In summary, cluster 19_5 represents the transient posterior-body “tail-bud enhancer program” that peaks around the 10-somite stage, is confined to tail-bud/NMP/caudal PSM cells, and is orchestrated by a CDX-HOX/PBX/TCF core module that sustains Wnt-dependent axial elongation and high proliferative capacity.
]

## Cluster 19_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19_6 marks a classic “paraxial-mesoderm / skeletal-muscle” regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at the 0-somite stage but rises further at 5–20 somites and then falls in most progenitor compartments by 30 somites.  
   • Maximal values are seen between 10 and 20 somites – the main window of segmentation and onset of myogenesis.  
   • A single, very sharp pulse appears in neural-optic tissue at 10 somites (likely a local enhancer reused in the eye rudiment).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and tail-bud mesoderm  
   • Newly formed somites and fast-muscle fibres  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) early on  
   • Fast-twitch muscle after differentiation (fast_muscle columns stay high up to 30 somites)  
   • Minor, transient activity in optic neuro-epithelium (neural_optic_10 somites)

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Genes in the cluster encode sarcomeric/contractile proteins (ttn, ryr1b, myhz2, ckma, speg), metabolic enzymes (ckma, galt), and segmentation / myogenic regulators (mespba, mef2cb, myo7b).  
   • GO/KEGG terms would converge on: skeletal-muscle differentiation, myofibril assembly, trunk/tail morphogenesis and somite segmentation.  
   • The optic spike suggests some elements are redeployed in early eye-field morphogenesis, a known feature of myogenesis-related enhancers.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and gene presence point to a canonical myogenic TF set:  
   • bHLH myogenic factors – MyoD (M00070), Myf5/Myf6, Myogenin (E-box motifs)  
   • SRF (M00117; strongest z-score in the list) – couples actin dynamics to transcription  
   • MEF2 family (M00118, motif cluster 10/113; mef2cb present in gene list) – activates structural muscle genes  
   • TCF/LEF & NFAT (M00120/25) – integrate Wnt and Ca²⁺/calcineurin signals during early myogenesis  
   • PBX/MEIS & HOX motifs – consistent with axial-level and segmentation control of trunk muscle enhancers

Together, these features indicate that peak-cluster 19_6 comprises enhancers that switch on during somitogenesis, remain active in fast-twitch muscle, and are driven primarily by MyoD–MEF2–SRF combinatorial binding, orchestrating the gene-expression programme for trunk skeletal-muscle formation.
]

## Cluster 19_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19_7 captures an early endodermal / secretory-organ programme that is transiently switched on during segmentation stages.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0–5 somites (≈10–12 hpf), reaches a sharp maximum at 10–15 somites (≈14–17 hpf) and falls steeply after 20 somites, being almost silent by 30 somites (24 hpf).  
   • The profile therefore marks an early-to-mid segmentation window, i.e. the period when definitive endoderm derivatives initiate organ-specific gene expression.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest ATAC signal)  
   • Hatching-gland cells – by far the strongest signal (16-22 a.u.).  
   • Endocrine-pancreas progenitors (islet domain of fore-gut endoderm).  
   • General endoderm and related early digestive tract / hepatopancreatic clusters show moderate enrichment.  
   • Most mesodermal or neuro-ectodermal lineages are at background levels.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Genes in the peak set are enriched for secretory-pathway components (e.g. cadps2, unc13b, syt genes), extracellular-matrix / protease modulators (mxra5b, loxl1, emp1, frzb) and metabolic transporters (abca1a, slc family), consistent with:  
     – Chorion-digestion function of the hatching gland (release of proteolytic enzymes).  
     – Onset of hormone/peptide secretion machinery in endocrine pancreas primordium.  
   • Many associated transcripts (pdxdc1, pdx1-interacting factors, frzb, foxo1a, gata factors) point to early endoderm organogenesis.

4. Likely driver transcription factors (motif & gene co-enrichment)  
   • Endoderm “pioneer” factors: FoxA (foxa1/2/3), Sox17/32, Gata4/5/6 – highest motif z-scores and expressed in the same cells.  
   • Pancreas / hatching-gland selectors: Pdx1, Onecut (Hnf6), Hnf1, Gcm2, Ptf1-related bHLH.  
   • Secretory-cell maturation: Maf (MafB/K), Creb/Atf and Nrf (Nfe2l) family motifs present, matching the secretory/oxidative gene set.  
   • Additional support factors: Hnf4α/γ, Rxr/Rar nuclear-receptor motifs and E-box (Mef2/Clock-BHLH) motifs that frequently appear in secretory organs.

In summary, cluster 19_7 demarcates a transient chromatin-accessibility wave that equips early hatching-gland cells and nascent endocrine-pancreas cells with the transcriptional and secretory machinery required for their rapid functional differentiation during mid-segmentation stages.
]

## Cluster 19_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19_8 marks an early, posterior body-axis programme that switches on during gastrulation/early segmentation and is largely shut down by the start of organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is high from shield/0-somite up to ~20-somite stage (≈10–19 hpf).  
   • Signal collapses at 30 somites/24 hpf in almost every cell population (many columns drop from ~6–7 to <1), indicating the programme is transient and switched off once axial elongation is completed.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest values)  
   • Tail-bud progenitors (tail_bud_0 s: 38; 5 s: 7.2; 10 s: 8.0) – strongest signal.  
   • Neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs), pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM) and early somites.  
   • Midline tissues: notochord, floor‐plate, neural floor plate.  
   • Posterior neural tube/boundary regions (hindbrain, midbrain-hindbrain boundary).  
   The cluster therefore unites posterior axial progenitors and their immediate neural and mesodermal descendants.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Antero-posterior patterning and axial elongation: dense representation of HOX, CDX, PBX/MEIS, UNCX, MIXL1, Brachyury (ta), Wnt8/9, Fgf8, Ror2, RA-pathway genes, etc.  
   • Convergence/extension, segmentation and early EMT/mesenchyme migration genes (e.g. foxf1/f2, prrx1, snai family, cadherin switches, eph/ephrins).  
   • High E2F signature suggests concomitant rapid proliferation of these progenitors.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene set)  
   • Posterior HOX paralogs together with their cofactors PBX/MEIS and CDX – set up positional identity.  
   • T-box factors (Brachyury/ta, Tbx16, Tbx6 family) – drive axial mesoderm and PSM.  
   • Wnt/β-catenin effectors (TCF7/TCF7l2/LEF1) – consistent with tail-bud Wnt activity.  
   • FOX (Foxa/Foxf/Foxc) and SOX (Sox2/3/9) families – maintain bipotent NMP state and mediate EMT.  
   • RAR/RXR and NR2F/COUP-TF motifs – integrate retinoic-acid gradient that terminates posterior programme.  
   • E2F/FOX-M1 – cell-cycle control of proliferating progenitors.

In summary, cluster 19_8 comprises enhancers that coordinate the early posterior axial extension module, active in tail-bud/NMP/PSM, regulating HOX–PBX-MEIS-TBX-Wnt/RA networks, and shutting down as cells exit the progenitor state by ~24 hpf.
]

## Cluster 19_9

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19_9 marks an early haemato-vascular chromatin programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already elevated at the 5-somite stage but reaches a sharp maximum between 10- and 20-somite stages (≈ 14–18 hpf).  
   • Signal falls back by the 30-somite stage (≈ 24 hpf), indicating that the programme is transient and restricted to the window when endothelial / blood progenitors are specified.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in:  
   • Hemangioblasts (common endothelial / blood progenitors) – 9.7 → 12.4 arbitrary units.  
   • Haematopoietic / vasculature cluster – 9.6 → 15.4 units.  
   Much lower, basal accessibility is detected in other mesodermal or neural derivatives, underscoring lineage-specific usage.

3. Regulatory processes implied  
   Associated genes and GO terms point to:  
   • Endothelial cell differentiation and vasculogenesis – lyve1b, mcamb, slit2, ddr2a, fgf22, bmp6, itga9, itpr1/3, mef2c-family, nr2f (COUP-TF) receptors.  
   • Emergence of definitive / primitive blood (tal1/lyve1-positive) – mrc1a, tal1-motif enrichment, runx motifs, gata target genes.  
   • Extracellular-matrix remodelling & cell migration (adamtsl3, dnajc15, tln1, tns2) required for endothelial sprouting.  
   • Strong proliferation signature (aurka, stard9, kif2a, e2f-motifs) consistent with rapidly expanding progenitors.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs strongly enriched)  
   • GATA family (Gata2/3/5/6, cluster 18) – canonical for haemato-vascular identity.  
   • ETS factors (Etv2, Fli1a/b, Erg, Elk1/3/4; clusters 49, 90) – endothelial specification.  
   • RUNX (Runx1/2/3; cluster 38) – haemogenic endothelium and early haematopoiesis.  
   • TAL1 / Lmo-complex factors (Tal1, Tal2; cluster 92) – primitive erythroid programme.  
   • COUP-TF / NR2F nuclear receptors (nr2f1/2/6; clusters 26, 31, 32, 55, 57, 77) – arterial/venous patterning.  
   • MEF2 family (cluster 10/113) – endothelial maturation and vascular morphogenesis.  
   • E2F/FOXM1 cell-cycle regulators (cluster 6/59/107) – progenitor expansion.

In summary, peak-cluster 19_9 represents an early, mesoderm-derived haemangioblast / endothelial-haematopoietic enhancer set that is maximally active during 10–20-somite stages and driven by a canonical GATA-ETS-RUNX-TAL network together with proliferative E2F/FOXM1 inputs.

## Cluster 19_10

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19_10 is an “eye-field/early-retina” module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at the 5-somite stage (~11–12 hpf), spikes dramatically at 10 somites (~14 hpf; optic_cup = 37 a.u.) and stays high through 15–20 somites, but drops again by 30 somites.  
   • Thus it marks the window in which the optic vesicle invaginates and the optic cup epithelium is patterned.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest signal: optic_cup pseudobulks (especially 10 somites) and, to a lesser extent, neural_optic populations.  
   • Modest accessibility in neighbouring anterior neural plate domains (midbrain–hindbrain boundary, telencephalon) is consistent with shared forebrain/eye regulators.  
   • Very low in mesoderm, endoderm or non-neural ectoderm, indicating strong lineage restriction.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Associated-gene list is enriched for classical eye-field/retina genes (rx1/2, pax6a/b, six3/6, lhx2, vsx1/2, otx1/2, irx1/3/5, onecut, tbx2/3, foxg1, sox2/3, crx, rorb, nr2e3, batf/nrf factors, etc.).  
   • Functional themes:  
     – Eye-field specification and optic cup morphogenesis.  
     – Early retinal neurogenesis and photoreceptor competence.  
     – Forebrain regionalisation (shared TFs with telencephalon).  
   • Many linked genes encode signalling modulators (wnt1, shh targets, fgf24, rspo2/3) that sculpt the optic territory.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched and present in mapping table)  
   • Homeobox eye-field TFs: Rx (rx1/2), Pax6, Six3/6, Lhx2/9, Vsx1/2, Otx2 – drive eye-field identity and retinal progenitor fate.  
   • Forkhead family: Foxg1, Foxi1/2/3, Foxc1 – involved in optic cup morphogenesis and anterior neural patterning.  
   • SOX pluripotency/neuronal factors: Sox2/3/19b support neuroepithelial competence.  
   • IRX and RFX families: refine dorsal–ventral and ciliogenesis programs in the developing retina.  
   • Nuclear-receptor cluster (Rxra/b, Rara/b, Rorb, Nr2e3) – characteristic of photoreceptor and retinal progenitor enhancers.  

Together these data indicate that cluster 19_10 contains enhancers that switch on precisely when the zebrafish optic vesicle becomes an optic cup, orchestrating the transcriptional network that establishes retinal progenitors and initiates early eye differentiation.
]

## Cluster 19_11

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 19_11 marks a late-segmentation “pan-neuronal” enhancer module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Low-to-moderate accessibility at 0–5-somite stages.  
   • Sharp rise from 10 som (≈14 hpf) onward and highest values at 20–30 som (≈20-24 hpf).  
   • One early pulse in the optic cup at 10 som (eye-field neurogenesis) is followed by sustained growth in the rest of the nervous system.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Enteric neurons (2 s: 2.4 → 30 s: 15.8; strongest signal).  
   • Differentiating/immature CNS neurons (progressive 2.3 → 6.3).  
   • Optic-cup neuro-epithelium peak at 10 som (34.8).  
   • Minor but significant signal in floor-plate, hindbrain and generic “neurons” samples; negligible in mesoderm or endoderm.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
   • Neuronal maturation & synaptogenesis   
     – Neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels: GRIK2/3/4, GRIN2, GABRB/G, SCN8A, CACNA1/2, RYR2, PIEZO2.  
     – Synaptic scaffolds & vesicle genes: CNTNAP2/3, LRRTM4, SHANK1/3, SYT1/7/9, SV2A, BSN, RIMS1.  
     – Axon path-finding / adhesion: L1-family, UNC5D, ROBO/SLIT3, PCDH clusters, DOCK4, ANK3.  
     – Neural-crest autonomic lineage TFs: PHOX2A/B, TLX3, SHOX2, LHX1/2/4/9, SOX10/21.  
   • Together these features point to assembly of functional excitatory and sensory neurons, especially vagal-crest-derived enteric neurons and early retinal ganglion-like cells.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (top motif families in the cluster and present in the gene set)  
   • SOX family (SOX10/9/2/21) – maintains neuro-ectoderm / neural-crest competence.  
   • PHOX2A/PHOX2B & TLX3 – specification of autonomic/enteric neurons.  
   • LHX/LBX/ISL homeobox factors – neuronal subtype identity, axon guidance.  
   • ROR / NR2F (COUP-TF) and RORA/RORB nuclear receptors – activity-dependent maturation genes.  
   • MEF2 & NEUROD/ATOH/ASCL bHLH factors – synaptic gene activation.  
   • FOX family (FOXP, FOXG, FOXC) and RFX – ciliary/axoneme and neuronal gene regulation.  

Taken together, cluster 19_11 contains enhancers that switch on as progenitors leave the cell cycle and begin neuronal differentiation, reaching maximal accessibility when synaptic and electrophysiological machinery is being assembled—most prominently in neural-crest-derived enteric neurons but shared with broad CNS “differentiating neuron” populations.
]

## Cluster 19_12

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19_12 corresponds to a short, sharp burst of chromatin opening in the posterior growth zone at the onset of segmentation and carries the regulatory signature of the classic posterior-patterning/Hox programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low at gastrula (0-somite) and again after ~15 somites, but spikes at the 10-somite stage (≈14 hpf) – tail_bud_10somites shows a >30-fold increase compared with all other samples.  
   • The signal therefore marks the brief window when the tail-bud/axial‐progenitor pool is most active just as somitogenesis begins.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in:  
   • Tail-bud cells (posterior axial progenitors) – dominant peak.  
   • Second-tier enrichment in closely related posterior tissues: neuromesodermal progenitors, posterior presomitic mesoderm, nascent somites and posterior spinal cord.  
   All other lineages show only the basal ~1.3–1.8 signal, indicating the cluster is essentially tail-bud–specific.

3. Regulatory programme implied  
   • Posterior body-axis extension and segmentation.  
   • Activation of trunk/tail Hox genes and other posterior identity genes.  
   • Wnt/FGF/Brachyury-driven maintenance of neuromesodermal progenitors and their rapid cell cycle (many cell-cycle/house-keeping promoters appear in the gene list because they are highly active in the tail-bud).  
   • Transition of progenitors into paraxial mesoderm and neural tube (genes for PSM, early muscle, spinal cord neurons are present).

4. Key transcription factors likely driving the cluster  
   (derived from motif catalogue and gene list overlaps)  
   • Posterior identity / axial extension: CDX family (cdx1b, cdx4), Brachyury/T (ta), Hox class (multiple hoxb/c/d members).  
   • Early mesoderm segmentation: TBX6/TBX16 (spadetail), MEOX/MSX family, Mnx/Lhx spinal cord factors.  
   • Wnt pathway effectors: TCF7/Lef1 motifs.  
   • Cell-cycle support: E2F1/2/3 motifs (reflecting the high proliferation rate of tail-bud cells).  

Taken together, peak-cluster 19_12 demarcates enhancers/promoters that switch on specifically in the posterior growth zone at ~10 somites to implement Hox-based trunk/tail patterning while keeping axial progenitors highly proliferative.
]

## Cluster 19_13

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19_13 captures a pan-neuronal regulatory programme that switches on as soon as the nervous system begins to differentiate and stays active while early neurons wire up.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low at 0 somites, rises sharply by 5–10 somites and peaks at 10–15 somites (≈14–17 hpf).  
   • Signal remains elevated through 20 somites and, in differentiated neuronal populations, into 30 somites (24 hpf).  
   • The single highest value (≈ ×8 over background) is in “tail-bud, 10 somites”, consistent with intense posterior neurogenesis at that stage.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in neural lineages:  
   • Differentiating neurons, generic “neurons”, spinal-cord and hind-/mid-brain pseudobulks.  
   • Posterior neural tube / tail-bud cells (neuromesodermal descendants).  
   • Modest signal in somite rows at 30 somites reflects neuronal projections invading the myotome; non-neural tissues stay near baseline.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Associated genes code for classic neuronal functions:  
   • Axon guidance / neurite outgrowth – slit2, plxnb2a, sulf2b, farp2, grin2da.  
   • Synaptic-vesicle & neurotransmission machinery – snap25a, sypb, syt3/9b, neflb, ctnna2.  
   • Calcium handling & excitability – itpr2, atp2a3, kcnd3.  
   • Neuronal metabolism / signalling – dao.1, adora4a, fgf11a, bmp7b.  
   Together these indicate the cluster marks enhancers that drive terminal differentiation, axon extension and first synapse formation of early CNS neurons, especially glutamatergic / sensory interneurons in posterior brain and spinal cord.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and TF-mapping point to a canonical neurogenic GRN:  
   • Proneural bHLH: Atoh1a/b, Neurog/NeuroD, Olig2 – initiate neuronal fate and axonogenesis.  
   • SoxB/SoxC family: Sox3, Sox2/19, Sox11/4 – maintain neural identity and promote neurite growth.  
   • Homeobox regulators: Pax6/3/7, Irx3/5, Pbx/Meis, Lhx & Dlx subclasses – pattern specific neuronal subtypes.  
   • ETS factors (Etv/Elf/Fli) and MEF2 family – control axonal targeting and activity-dependent maturation.  
   • Additional support from PBX/PKNOX and CREB/ATF motifs matches genes involved in synaptic plasticity.

In summary, peak-cluster 19_13 represents enhancers that are maximally open during the 10–15-somite window in posterior neural tube and differentiating neuronal populations, regulated by proneural bHLH–Sox–Homeobox TF combinations to drive axon outgrowth, synaptogenesis and early neuronal maturation.
]

## Cluster 19_14

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19_14 marks a surface-ectoderm/optic-epithelium programme that turns on in mid-somitogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low at gastrulation (0-somite) but rises sharply by 5-somites and peaks at 10-somites (~14 hpf).  
   • Signal drops again by 30-somites, indicating this is an early organogenesis burst rather than a long-lived open state.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in:  
   • Epidermis (basal/surface ectoderm) – strongest and sustained (values 8-13 vs ~3 in most other tissues).  
   • Optic cup epithelium – very pronounced spike at 10-somites (value ≈ 36).  
   Moderate enrichment is also present in hatching-gland and cranial surface ectoderm derivatives, but mesoderm, endoderm or neural tissues show only basal background (~3).

3. Underlying biological programme  
   Associated genes point to extracellular-matrix production, basement-membrane assembly and epithelial morphogenesis, all processes essential for epidermal barrier formation and retinal cup folding.  
   • ECM / basement membrane: col4a1, col7a1l, col14a1a, postnb, itga1, tns1b.  
   • Epithelial differentiation / barrier: krt99, tgm1l1, egfra, piezo1, stim1a, ppap2d.  
   • Eye-specific factors: six7, tulp1a, ush2a, nlgn2a.  
   • Cell-adhesion/ polarity regulators: ctnna1, jupa, plekha7b, plrdgb, ptpn13.  
   Together, the cluster likely coordinates:  
   – Epidermal stratification and barrier maturation.  
   – Optic-cup bending and early photoreceptor/retinal epithelial differentiation.

4. Key transcription factors (motif & gene support)  
   Motif enrichment plus co-expressed TF genes highlight:  
   • TFAP2 family (tfap2b present in gene list) – master regulators of surface ectoderm/epidermis and lens.  
   • PAX6 / SIX (six7 in gene list; strong motifs for SIX/PAX class) – canonical optic-cup regulators.  
   • SOX-E/SOX-2 group – maintain ectodermal competence and early retinal progenitors.  
   • MITF/TFE family (motif cluster with MITF/TFE, SREBF) – pigment/epithelial programme.  
   • KLF/GRHL/TEAD motifs are also enriched, consistent with epithelial sheet maturation and mechanical-stress response (Piezo1, Stim1).

Taken together, peak-cluster 19_14 represents an early-somitogenesis surface-ectoderm enhancer set that is maximally active in epidermis and the developing optic cup, driving ECM deposition, cell-adhesion and epithelial morphogenesis under the control of TFAP2, PAX6/SIX, SOX and MITF/TFE transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 19_15

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19_15 highlights a regulatory module that switches on during mid-segmentation and is centred on the notochord / ventral midline programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already moderate at the 0-, 5- and 10-somite stages (~2 AU) but shows a sharp spike at the 20-somite time-point (≈ 6.8 AU), then returns to the baseline (~2 AU) by 30 somites.  
   • Hence the cluster reaches maximal activity ~19–20 hpf (late segmentation / onset of early organogenesis).

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • The dominant peak is in the notochord (20-somites).  
   • Secondary but consistent accessibility is seen in ventral neural tube / floor-plate, spinal cord, differentiating neurons and endoderm, but these never exceed the notochord signal.  
   • Other germ-layer derivatives show only basal accessibility.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   • Associated genes are rich in extracellular-matrix and collagen-processing enzymes (col14a1a, plod2, loxl3b, adamts2), characteristic of the notochordal sheath and midline basement membrane.  
   • Many neuronal / axon-guidance genes (nlgn4, ntrk3b, sv2a, gria4, syngap1b, ret) indicate concurrent activation of ventral spinal-cord / hind-brain differentiation.  
   • Gene set enrichment therefore points to:  
     – Notochord maturation and sheath formation  
     – Floor-plate establishment and SHH-dependent midline patterning  
     – Early synaptogenesis / axon extension in ventral neurons

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs enriched in the cluster)  
   • T-box / Brachyury family: ta/tb, tbx16, tbx6 – canonical notochord drivers.  
   • Forkhead factors: FoxA2/Foxa, FoxD3/D5, FoxF – pioneer factors of axial mesendoderm and midline.  
   • SoxB1/Sox19/2/3 – maintain axial progenitor competence and promote floor-plate identity.  
   • Pax3/7 and Irx1/3/5 – boundary setters for dorsal–ventral patterning.  
   • Nuclear receptors (ROR / COUP-TF, RXR/RAR) and Klf/Sp families appear as modulators of ECM-related transcription.

In sum, cluster 19_15 marks a burst of chromatin opening in the notochord at ~20 hpf that coordinates extracellular-matrix assembly and signals required for floor-plate and ventral neuronal differentiation, orchestrated chiefly by Brachyury/T-box and FoxA pioneer factors with support from Sox, Pax and Irx proteins.
]

## Cluster 19_16

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19_16 represents a broadly open, retinoic-acid (RA)–responsive chromatin module that turns on during early somitogenesis and is shared by several paraxial–mesoderm derivatives with a striking transient spike in primordial germ cells.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0-somite (10 hpf), rises further at 5–10-somite stages and reaches its maximum at ~10 somites (~14–15 hpf).  
   • It remains moderately high through 15–20 somites and then falls sharply by 30 somites (≈24 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest signal is seen in:  
   • Primordial germ cells (especially 10-somites).  
   • Paraxial-mesoderm lineage: neuro-mesodermal progenitors, presomitic mesoderm, newly segmented somites and early fast-muscle.  
   Other tissues show only baseline accessibility.

3. Likely regulatory programme  
   Gene/motif composition (multiple Hox genes, meox1/2, tbx4/5/16, raraa, rargb, nr2f, rxr, ppar, gata genes) points to an RA-driven axial-patterning and myogenic programme that is also used transiently by migrating germ cells.  Functions include:  
   • Anterior–posterior patterning of paraxial mesoderm and somite maturation.  
   • Early skeletal- and fast-muscle differentiation.  
   • RA-dependent cues that guide PGC migration and survival.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and TF–gene overlap highlight:  
   • RAR/RXR heterodimers (raraa, rargb, rxraa/b) – execute RA signalling.  
   • COUP-TFs / NR2F1/2/5 and ROR nuclear receptors – secondary RA-responsive regulators.  
   • HOX and PBX/MEIS cofactors – transmit RA cues to positional-identity genes.  
   • SOX & FOX family members – maintain progenitor identity and mesoderm differentiation.  
   • E2F/MEF2 contribute proliferative and myogenic components.

Together, cluster 19_16 marks RA-responsive regulatory regions that are widely accessible during early trunk formation, peaking during mid-somitogenesis and most prominent in primordial germ cells and paraxial-mesoderm–derived cell types.
]

## Cluster 19_17

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19_17 marks the “neuro-secretory” transcriptional program that is switched on late in somitogenesis to endow endocrine-pancreatic cells – and, to a lesser extent, maturing neurons – with synaptic/secretory machinery.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is basically basal (≈1.4-2.0) from 0-20 somites and then rises sharply at the 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf).  
   • The jump is most dramatic in endocrine pancreas (from 1.7–1.9 to 17.4; >10-fold), indicating activation during endocrine-cell maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest signal:  
   • Endocrine-pancreas 30 som – by far the peak carrier.  
   Next tier (moderately elevated 2.0–2.5):  
   • Differentiating neurons / generic neurons  
   • Hindbrain & spinal-cord neuronal subsets  
   • Neural-optic domain (transient spike at 10 som)  
   Most other tissues remain at baseline.

3. Regulated biological processes  
   Gene catalogue is enriched for vesicle-docking, Ca²⁺-influx and neuro-secretory components: RIMS2, UNC13B, SYNGAP1, CACNA1 family, GRIA/GRIN glutamate receptors, BRSK2, PDE1C, SLC8A4, SCG3, etc.  
   GO/KEGG themes (implied):  
   • Regulated exocytosis / insulin-granule release  
   • Voltage-gated Ca²⁺ signalling  
   • Synapse organisation & neurotransmitter response  
   • Axon guidance/adhesion (CNTN, LRFN, NLGN, NRXN genes)  
   Collectively these are the molecular toolkit shared by neuroendocrine β-cells and neurons.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
   Motif enrichment and factor mapping point to the classic endocrine-neuroendocrine TF ensemble:  
   • Pdx1 / Nkx2.2 / Nkx6.1 – β-cell lineage commitment.  
   • Pax6 – pan-endocrine and neural differentiation.  
   • Rfx6/Rfx4 – endocrine fate & secretory‐gene activation.  
   • Neurod1/Neurod4, Atoh1/7 – bHLH drivers of neuronal & endocrine differentiation.  
   • MafA/MafB – terminal maturation of insulin-secreting cells.  
   • FoxA/FoxP/Sox family motifs – early competence and chromatin priming.  
   • Meis/Pbx/Onecut & Gata factors appear as co-factors coordinating enhancer activity.

In summary, cluster 19_17 represents late-stage activation of a neuro-secretory enhancer set, peaking in the endocrine pancreas at 30 somites and secondarily in maturing neurons, orchestrated by the Pdx1/Pax6/Rfx/NeuroD/Maf transcriptional module to install Ca²⁺-dependent vesicle release machinery.
]

## Cluster 20_0

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 20_0 marks a set of regulatory elements that switch on very early, primarily in cardiac/lateral-plate-mesoderm derivatives, and then taper off as organogenesis proceeds.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Strongest accessibility at the earliest profiled stage (0-somite, 10 hpf).  
• Signal drops sharply by 5-somite (~11.5 hpf) and thereafter remains at “baseline” (~4–5 log2 counts) in most cell types.  
→ Interpretation: these regions act as early “heart-field / cardiopharyngeal-mesoderm priming” enhancers that are largely shut down once differentiated programmes take over.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Heart_myocardium_0-somite (56.9; >10-fold higher than any other pseudobulk).  
• Secondary but clear signal in early lateral-plate mesoderm, hemangioblast / hematopoietic-vasculature, and optic-cup progenitors.  
• Little or no enrichment in surface ectoderm, epidermis, endoderm or mature muscle/neuronal populations.  
→ Spectrum is typical for the cardiac/vascular branch of anterior–lateral mesoderm.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Enriched gene list and motif content point to:  
• Cardiogenesis: tbx5a/b, tbx20, gata4/5/6, mef2 (mef2ca/-cb/-d), mybpc3, vegfaa, kdrl, dll4.  
• Early vasculogenesis / hemangioblast specification: etv2, fli1a/b, erg, runx1, tal1.  
• Retinoic-acid signalling & RA-responsive ECM remodelling (rxraa, rarga/b, rorb, hox clusters, fat4, adamts genes).  
• Chromatin priming machinery (kdm2ba/b, lin28a/b) characteristic of early cardiac mesoderm.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif and gene enrichment converge on five TF modules:  
• GATA factors – Gata4/5/6 supply the canonical cardiac pioneer activity.  
• TBX family – Tbx5/20 and Tbx1 (cardiac/aortic arch) give positional identity.  
• MEF2 family – Mef2c/d switch on contractile/structural programmes.  
• ETS/ERG/ETV2 cluster – vascular/hemangioblast network co-acts in the shared cardiopharyngeal field.  
• FOXC/FOXF/FOXA – forkhead pioneers that license enhancers for both heart and vascular endothelium.  
Secondary contributors: RA-receptors (Rara/Rxra), TEAD1, KDM2B-CXXC chromatin reader (motifs 16/82), and early stress-responsive HSF/ATF motifs that often mark rapidly opening developmental enhancers.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 20_0 represents an early enhancer set used by the nascent cardiac/vascular mesoderm during gastrulation–early segmentation.  It is maximally active in 0-somite heart progenitors, less so in other lateral-plate-derived cells, and becomes largely attenuated once definitive myocardium and endothelium are specified.  Its activity is driven by GATA-TBX-MEF2‐ETS-FOXC TF circuitry that initiates cardiogenesis and associated vasculogenic programmes.
]

## Cluster 20_1

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 20_1 corresponds to a small set of regulatory regions that “switch on” during mid-somite stages and remain exceptionally open in a few highly specialised cell types.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Basal accessibility is low at 0–5 somites.  
• A first accessibility surge occurs at 10 somites (~14 hpf) – mainly in telencephalon-derived neural cells (neural_telencephalon_10 s = 31.8).  
• A second, still stronger surge is seen at 30 somites (~24 hpf) in cardiac tissue (heart_myocardium_30 s = 49.4).  
→ The cluster therefore represents a late-opening enhancer set that is first used by early forebrain neurons and is maximally active in the maturing myocardium by the end of our time-course.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest ATAC signal:  
• Telencephalic neuro‐ectoderm / immature forebrain neurons (10 somites).  
• Contractile heart myocardium (especially 24 hpf).  
Moderate signal: differentiating generic neurons, endocrine pancreas and PSM, consistent with low-level use of the same enhancers in other excitable or mesodermal derivatives.

3. Regulatory programme implied by associated genes  
The correlated gene list is strongly enriched for:  
• Neuronal connectivity / synaptogenesis: NPAS3, CNTNAP2a, NRXN3b, UNC5C, GRIN2D, ROBO1, TANC2.  
• Excitable-cell ion handling: KCNB2, KCNC3a, ITPR1b, SLC24A4b.  
• Sarcomeric contractile apparatus and ECM for muscle/heart: TTN.1, TNNI1b, TNNI4a, COL12A1b, COL14A1a, MXRA5b.  
• Nuclear receptors and metabolic regulators (PPAR g, ROR c, ESR1) typical of late functional maturation.  
→ Together these genes point to programmes that build the structural and signalling machinery of fully functional excitable cells – synaptic neurons and beating cardiomyocytes.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & biological context)  
Although motif z-scores are slightly negative (background-corrected), the most over-represented motifs belong to TF families known to control the two highlighted lineages:  
• Forebrain / telencephalon: FoxG1, Pax6, Sox2/3/1, Tbr1/Otx, Homeobox (DLX/BSX/VAX) – present in mapping tables 1-4, 7, 34, 68.  
• Heart myocardium: Nkx2-5/2-3/2-7 (table 98), Gata4/5/6 (table 18), Tbx5/20 (tables 62, 94), Mef2 (tables 10, 113) and Hand2 (table 29).  
• Maturation & metabolic TFs shared by both cell types: Nuclear receptors (RORα/β/γ, NR2F/COUP, RXR, PPAR; tables 11, 26, 31, 32, 55, 57, 76, 77), and E-box factors (BATF/JUN/FOS; tables 43, 64, 79) that cooperate with pioneer FOX/SOX proteins.

Concise interpretation  
Peak cluster 20_1 marks late-opening enhancers that first support anterior neural-plate / telencephalic differentiation and are later redeployed (or remain accessible) in the developing myocardium. These elements are likely controlled by FOX/SOX pioneers together with region-specific patterning TFs (Pax6, FoxG1 in brain; Nkx/Gata/Tbx/Mef2 in heart) and nuclear-receptor cofactors, collectively driving the assembly of synaptic and contractile gene programmes required for functional neurons and beating cardiomyocytes.
]

## Cluster 20_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 20_2 can be viewed as an “early-cardiac / paraxial-mesoderm” module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility explodes at the very first sampled stage (0-somite ≈10–11 hpf); the heart-myocardium pseudobulk at this stage is ≈90-fold above the background (89.9 vs. ≈2–3 elsewhere).  
• Accessibility drops sharply after gastrulation and stays only modestly elevated (2.5–3.2) through 30-somite embryos.  
→ The regions are therefore maximally open during the window when cardiac progenitors are specified from lateral-plate mesoderm and shut down once chamber-myocytes begin terminal differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signals:  
• Heart-myocardium (dominant)  
• Lateral-plate mesoderm derivatives (LPM 15–20 som; 3.1)  
• Fast / trunk muscle and generic “muscle” pseudobulks (2.9–3.0)  
Lower-level accessibility is seen in other early mesodermal populations (hemangioblast, somite) but almost absent from neural, endodermal or ectodermal lineages.  

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Gene set and ontology hints (myh7, tnni2b, atp2a2a, fgfr2, hand-type signalling genes) point to:  
• Cardiac sarcomere assembly & excitation–contraction coupling  
• Early cardiomyocyte metabolic switch (acl-, gpam-, hmgcr-type genes)  
• Shared myogenic programme used by trunk fast muscle (myf5/6-independent thick-filament genes)  
Functionally these peaks likely correspond to first-wave cardiac enhancers that are revisited later by skeletal-muscle precursors.

4. Likely driver transcription factors  
Motif enrichment groups that are over-represented in this cluster converge on the canonical cardiac gene battery:  
• GATA family (gata4/5/6) – Group 18  
• TBX factors (tbx5a/20/1) – Group 62  
• NKX2 family (nkx2-5/3) – Groups 70, 98  
• MEF2 (mef2aa/ca/cb/d) – Group 10  
• SRF & TEAD co-motifs (actin remodelling) – Groups 40, 82  
• HAND2, IRX4/3 and FOXC/F/K motifs also appear in the indirect list, consistent with early cardiac-LPM identity.

Together these TFs choreograph the very first opening of cardiac enhancers, explaining the dramatic spike in accessibility restricted to 0-somite heart progenitors and the residual, broader signal in mesoderm-derived muscle tissues later in development.

## Cluster 20_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 20_3 represents the regulatory landscape of the zebrafish hatching-gland programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already moderate at gastrulation/early segmentation (0–10 somites ≈10–14 hpf; values ~7–8) but rises sharply after 20 somites.  
   • A dramatic spike is seen at 30-somite embryos (≈24 hpf): hatching_gland_30 somites = 61.7 (≈8-fold higher than any other sample). → The cluster reaches its maximal activity immediately before hatching.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest accessibility: hatching-gland cells (specialised secretory cells on the animal pole).  
   • Secondary, much smaller enrichments are seen in early optic primordium (neural_optic_0 somites) and midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB_10 somites), tissues that share anterior ectodermal origin with the hatching gland.  
   • Most other cell types remain at baseline (~7–8), indicating that 20_3 is strongly biased to the hatching-gland lineage.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
   • Gene list contains the canonical hatching-enzyme loci (zgc:66433 – he1a; zgc:66447 – he1b) plus numerous secreted proteases (adamts16, bmp8a, gdf11, mmp-like genes) and ECM/adhesion genes (col11a2, fn1b, cspg4).  
   • Enrichment of lipid- and vesicle-trafficking genes (srebf-targets, atp6v0a2a, slc family, rab GTPases) fits the massive secretory activity of mature hatching-gland cells.  
   • Together, 20_3 marks enhancers driving final differentiation of hatching-gland cells and production/secretion of chorion-lytic enzymes required for embryo hatching.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (from motif-enrichment + TF-mapping)  
   • MiT/TFE family (TFEC, TFE3, TFEB, MITFb) – very high motif z-scores; known master regulators of lysosomal/secretory genes.  
   • SREBP (Srebf1/2) – supports lipid-biosynthetic arm of secretion.  
   • Bach/Jun/ATF (BACH1/2, JUN, ATF3, JDP2) – AP-1–like factors often cooperate with MiT/TFE during secretory-cell maturation.  
   • GATA factors (Gata3/4/5/6) – drive anterior ectodermal and glandular programmes.  
   • SOX family (Sox2/3/14/19) – anterior neural/ectoderm competence factors seen in early optic & MHB accessibility.  
   • Nuclear-receptor cluster (RAR/RXR/NR2F) – retinoid signalling implicated in anterior ectoderm specification and hatching-gland development.

Summary  
Peak cluster 20_3 is a late-segmentation, hatching-gland–specific enhancer set that switches on between 20- and 30-somite stages to activate secretory machinery and hatching-enzyme genes under the control of MiT/TFE, SREBP, AP-1/Bach, GATA and SOX transcription factors.

## Cluster 20_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 20_4 marks a broad set of regulatory elements that switch on as the nervous system starts to regionalise and neurons begin to differentiate.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises steadily through somitogenesis, with modest levels at 0–5 som (​~10-12 hpf), higher at 10–15 som, and highest at 20–30 som (​~18-24 hpf).  
   • Many non-neural tissues (tail-bud, early epidermis, early NMPs) show a decline or plateau after 10 som, indicating that the cluster’s activity becomes progressively restricted to neural derivatives.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signal at 20–30 som)  
   • Ventral/medial neural tube derivatives: floor plate, spinal cord, hind-/mid-brain, neural progenitors and differentiating neurons.  
   • Additional neural-related tissues with strong signal: hindbrain, midbrain–hindbrain boundary, neurons (generic), somites and presomitic mesoderm (reflecting neuro-mesodermal progenitors).  
   • Only low–moderate accessibility in mesendodermal or surface ectoderm lineages; epidermis and tail-bud lose accessibility late.  

3. Likely regulatory programme  
   Genes linked to the peaks (foxd3, pax3/7, dbx1, otx/gbx, nkx, lhx, sox, multiple Hox paralogs, wnt4/7/11, fgf11/fgfr3, rest, ncam1, mdka, met, rapgef, etc.) point to:  
   • Patterning of posterior/ventral CNS (spinal cord, hindbrain, floor-plate).  
   • Neural-crest and neuro-mesodermal progenitor maintenance/segregation.  
   • Onset of neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation (axon guidance, synaptogenesis genes).  
   • Retinoic-acid/Wnt/FGF signalling integration that coordinates rostro-caudal and dorso-ventral neural pattern.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
   Motif enrichment and gene co-expression converge on:  
   • Sox family (Sox2/3/5/10/14/21) – stem/progenitor competence and neural-crest specification.  
   • Fox factors (Foxa2, Foxd3, Foxg1, FoxP family) – floor-plate identity, neural-crest and forebrain patterning.  
   • Hox/Pbx/Meis cassette – rostro-caudal positional identity.  
   • Pax (Pax3/7, Pax6) and Nkx (Nkx2/6) – spinal/hindbrain regionalisation.  
   • Lhx/Isl & Otx/Gbx pairs – motor-neuron, hindbrain lineage specification.  
   • bHLH neurogenic TFs (NeuroD1/4, Atoh1/7, Olig2) – neuronal differentiation.  
   • RA-nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF) – retinoic-acid response.  

Together, peak-cluster 20_4 represents an enhancer set that progressively activates in the developing zebrafish nervous system to establish regional neural identity and drive early neurogenesis from ~12 to 24 hpf.
]

## Cluster 20_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 20_5 corresponds to the very early “contractile‐mesoderm” programme that seeds both cardiac and skeletal muscle lineages.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility peaks at the very first sampled stage (0-somite / ~10 hpf):  
  – heart_myocardium_0 somites ≈ 48 (background ≈ 2)  
  – muscle_0 somites ≈ 37  
• Accessibility falls sharply after segmentation – already lower at 5- to 20-somite stages and approaches baseline by 30 somites (≈ 24 hpf) in most cell types.  
→ The elements act during gastrulation and early segmentation, then close once differentiated contractile tissue is established.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signals are confined to mesodermal derivatives that will build contractile tissues:  
  • nascent myocardium (heart_myocardium_0 s)  
  • nascent skeletal/fast muscle clusters (muscle_0–20 s, fast-muscle_0 s)  
  • precursor mesoderm (PSM, NMP) show moderate accessibility, consistent with priming before overt differentiation.  
Other germ-layer derivatives retain only basal accessibility.

3. Regulatory/biological programme  
Associated genes are enriched for:  
  • Contractile apparatus & sarcomere assembly (ttn.1, myh11a, myl10, actc1c, tnrc18)  
  • Calcium handling & excitation–contraction coupling (cacna2d1, plc-β1, piezo1)  
  • ECM / attachment (col11a1b, col12a1a, loxl4, pxdn)  
  • Myocyte metabolism & membrane biogenesis (fasn, acaca, acss3, abca/abcg transporters)  
  • Core cardiomyogenic regulators (mef2ca, tbx5a/b, tbx20, vgll4a)  
Gene ontology therefore points to early myogenesis/cardiogenesis, sarcomere organisation and metabolic up-shifts required for rapidly differentiating, contractile cells.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment together with expressed TFs highlight a classic cardiac / myogenic cassette:  
  • MEF2 family (Mef2ca/ab/b/d) – master activator of muscle structural genes  
  • TBX factors (Tbx5/20/15/3) – cardiomyocyte and limb/axial muscle specification  
  • GATA factors (Gata4/5/6) – cardiac enhancer priming, also cooperating with TBX/MEF2  
  • SRF & TEAD/VGLL4 – actin-cytoskeleton and Hippo-responsive growth modules  
  • NKX2-5/Nkx2.3/2.5 motifs present but just below top ranks, fitting early heart identity  
  • E2F/FOXM1 motifs reflect the proliferative state of these progenitors.

In summary, peak-cluster 20_5 marks an early, highly accessible enhancer set that turns on the core contractile-mesoderm gene programme in nascent myocardium and skeletal muscle, driven chiefly by MEF2, TBX and GATA transcription factors and shutting down as differentiation proceeds toward 24 hpf.

## Cluster 21_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 21_0 = “axis-elongation / somitogenesis” module

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises at the start of somitogenesis (0-5 somites), peaks at 10-15 somites (~13-16 hpf) and diminishes by 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • Highest value in the whole matrix occurs in PSM_10somites.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) → all stages, especially 0-15 somites.  
   • Tail-bud / neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP).  
   • Newly forming somites and nascent fast-muscle nuclei.  
   • Only low–moderate signal in neural, endodermal or mature organ lineages.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Paraxial mesoderm specification and segmentation clock – mespa/mespb, ripply1, her7, dll/Notch, wnt3a/8a, fgf8a.  
   • Anterior–posterior axial patterning – dense coverage of HoxA/B/C/D clusters, meox1/2, pbx/meis cofactors.  
   • Early myogenesis – myf5, myod1, myog, mef2c/b, cav3, desma, acta1a.  
   • ECM and morphogenesis genes (fn1a/b, col11/12, has2, tgf-β modulators) consistent with somite epithelialisation and muscle fibre emergence.  
   • Proliferation and elongation cues (e2f family, fgf, wnt, hippo/tead signatures).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (supported by motif enrichment & linked genes)  
   • T-box family: Ta/Brachyury, Tbx16/6/24 – drive axial extension & PSM identity.  
   • Mesp-Ripply axis (mespa, mespb, ripply1/2) – somite boundary formation.  
   • Hox paralogs + Pbx/Meis/Prep co-factors – antero-posterior patterning of nascent somites.  
   • Forkhead factors (FoxC1/2, FoxD3/5, FoxF) – paraxial mesoderm and muscle precursor enhancers.  
   • LEF/TCF & Tead – Wnt and Hippo inputs to the segmentation clock.  
   • Myogenic bHLH/Mef2 cascade (Myf5, Myod, Mef2a/b/c) – initiation of skeletal-muscle programme.  
   • E2F/Cell-cycle factors – high proliferation in tail-bud/PSM.

Taken together, cluster 21_0 marks regulatory elements that are activated in tail-bud and presomitic mesoderm during the window when the zebrafish trunk is being segmented and the first muscle fibres are being specified.
]

## Cluster 21_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 21_1 captures the chromatin programme that builds the posterior trunk of the embryo.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises already at gastrula/0-somite stage, peaks through early somitogenesis (≈5-15 somites, 12–18 hpf) in tail-bud and PSM, and falls markedly by 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
→ The cluster is therefore most active during the segmentation period when paraxial mesoderm is being patterned and somites are epithelialising.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest pseudobulk values)  
• Tail-bud > Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) > Newly formed somites > Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs)  
• Secondary but clear accessibility in early fast-/global muscle, hemangioblast / haematovascular mesoderm and lateral‐plate derivatives.  
• Very low signal in neural/endodermal lineages.  

3. Biological programme represented  
Gene set and GO hints: many posterior HOX genes (hoxb3/5, hoxa9, hoxc10, hoxd3 etc.), wnt5b, rarab, mef2d, sox7, gata factors, collagens/fibrillins.  
→ Processes likely regulated  
• Axial identity specification (posterior Hox code, Cdx/RA/Wnt interplay)  
• Segmentation clock & somite maturation (Mesp/Tbx/Notch targets)  
• Early myogenic and vasculogenic differentiation downstream of paraxial mesoderm (Mef2, Gata/Sox7)  
• ECM remodelling needed for somite boundary formation (Adamts9/16, Col18a1, Col4/8)  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
• Posterior HOX family (posterior group 6-13 motifs strongly enriched) – confers trunk identity.  
• CDX / TBX6-like caudal factors (Cdx1/4 motifs co-enriched) – activate posterior Hox cascade.  
• FOX family (FoxD1/3/5, FoxP4, FoxF1/F2 motifs) – mesoderm and somitic epithelialisation.  
• MEF2 (mef2d/ab motifs) – initiates myogenic differentiation inside maturing somites.  
• RA-receptors (RAR/RXR motifs; genes rarab, rarga/b) – RA gradient that opposes Wnt/FGF in PSM.  
• GATA/SOX7/18 motifs – endothelial–haematopoietic competence emerging from anterior PSM.  
Taken together, peak-cluster 21_1 marks regulatory elements that are switched on as paraxial/tail-bud mesoderm arises, drive HOX-based axial patterning and initiate the first wave of muscle– and vessel-forming gene expression before being shut down once organogenesis proceeds.
]

## Cluster 21_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 21_2 captures regulatory DNA that is turned on in the posterior body–forming mesoderm at the onset of somitogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is maximal at the start of the somite period (0–10 somites ≈ 10–15 hpf) and remains high to ~15 somites; it drops markedly by 20–30 somites in most lineages (except the still-proliferating tail-bud).  
• This profile matches the window when the embryo is elongating most rapidly and paraxial mesoderm is being laid down segment-by-segment.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest‐to-lowest)  
• Tail-bud progenitors (19–21 arbitrary units)  
• Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) (~14–16)  
• Paraxial/Somitic mesoderm (PSM) (~14–17 early, falling to ≈7 at 30 somites)  
• Early trunk/fast-muscle precursors and generic “muscle_0–10 somites” samples (≈ 13)  
Lower but significant signals are seen in differentiating neurons and notochord, consistent with the mixed fate potential of NMPs.

3. Putative regulatory programme  
The linked gene set is enriched for factors required for posterior axis elongation and somitic mesoderm differentiation:  
• T-box genes (tbx16/spadetail, tbx16-like, ta/brachyury)  
• Canonical and non-canonical Wnt ligands (wnt5b, wnt7ab)  
• RA-modulating enzyme cyp26a1  
• ECM/adhesion genes (col27a1b, has2, fn1b, adam12)  
• Multiple HOX, CDX, Runx and muscle/matrix genes.  
Together they point to segmentation, axial patterning, convergence–extension and the early myogenic programme.

4. Likely driver transcription factors (motif enrichment + expressed genes)  
• T-box class: TBX16/6 and Brachyury (Ta) – master regulators of paraxial mesoderm and tail-bud.  
• CDX/HOX code (Cdx1b/4, posterior HoxA/B/C/D paralogs) – patterning along the A-P axis.  
• LEF/TCF family – mediators of strong Wnt signalling in the tail-bud/NMP domain.  
• MEIS/PBX and PKNox (co-factors that cooperate with HOX).  
• SOX2/SOX3 – maintain pluripotency of NMPs while T-box factors push mesodermal fate.  
• RUNX, NF-YA/BATF-AP1 and NR/Retinoid receptors appear as secondary hits and may integrate RA & FGF/Wnt signalling balance.

Summary  
Cluster 21_2 marks an early posterior-mesoderm enhancer set controlled by TBX16/Brachyury-CDX/HOX-TCF factors that drive tail-bud extension, segmentation and initiation of trunk/fast-muscle differentiation during the 10–15 hpf window.
]

## Cluster 21_3

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 21_3 captures the open-chromatin program that drives early paraxial-mesoderm segmentation and the onset of myogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility peaks between 0–10 somite stages (≈10–14 hpf): PSM_10 somites = 119, PSM_0 somites = 108, Tail-bud_0 somites = 112.  
• Accessibility progressively falls during later stages, dropping by >40 % by 30 somites (e.g. PSM_30 somites = 81; Somites_30 somites = 27).  
→ The cluster corresponds to the somitogenesis window rather than to later organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signals occur in cell types that make or derive from paraxial mesoderm:  
• Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and Tail-bud  
• Newly formed Somites  
• Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs)  
• Notochord and early fast-muscle/myotome show moderate enrichment.  
Neural, endodermal, vascular or ectodermal lineages display only baseline accessibility.

3. Underlying biological program  
The correlated gene set is heavily enriched for “core segmentation-clock / somite” genes (tbx6, tbx16, tbxta, msgn1, mespaa/mespab, ripply1/2, her7), Wnt/FGF components (fgf8a, fgf17, wnt2bb), extracellular-matrix and adhesion genes needed for somite boundary formation (fn1b, has2, alcamb, itga4, itga5), plus early myogenic regulators (myf5, myod1, mymk, tnni2).  
Pathway annotation therefore points to:  
• Periodic segmentation of the PSM (segmentation clock)  
• Anterior–posterior patterning and epithelialisation of nascent somites  
• Commitment of paraxial cells toward the myotome (fast muscle).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment and gene co-expression converge on:  
• T-box factors – Tbx6, Tbx16, Tbxta (Brachyury) – master regulators of paraxial identity and clock oscillation.  
• Msgn1 – drives the segmentation gene cascade upstream of Mesp.  
• Mesp-family regulators (mespaa/mespab) and Ripply1/2 – establish segment borders.  
• LEF/TCF and Hes/Her motifs – reflect Wnt and Notch signalling that pace the clock.  
• FoxC/FoxD, Meox1/2 – specify somite derivatives.  
• Early myogenic bHLH/Mef2 motifs (Myf5/Myod, Mef2a/d) – mark the transition to muscle differentiation.

Together, these data indicate that peak cluster 21_3 demarcates the regulatory landscape used by early paraxial mesoderm and presomitic mesoderm cells to execute the segmentation program and initiate skeletal-muscle lineage commitment during the first half-day of zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 21_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 21_4 marks a “spinal-cord/neuro-ectoderm” regulatory program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at the 0-somite stage (10 hpf) but rises further, peaking between 10- and 15-somites (≈14–18 hpf).  
• After 20 somites accessibility starts to fall and is clearly lower – though still above background – by 30 somites (24 hpf).  
→ The cluster therefore corresponds to early neural-tube patterning and the onset of neurogenesis rather than later neuronal maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest chromatin opening is seen in:  
• Spinal-cord pseudobulks (42–52 AU across 0–20 somites, the maximal values in the matrix)  
• Neural progenitor / neural plate derivatives – NMPs (~26 AU) and generic “neural” clusters (~19–22 AU)  
• Early neural-crest (25 AU at 0 somites, rapidly declining thereafter)  
Accessibility is low in mesodermal/endodermal or non-neural ectodermal lineages (PSM ~14 AU, endoderm/epidermis ≤10 AU, notochord ≈0).

3. Implied biological processes  
Gene lists are enriched for regulators and effectors of:  
• Anterior-posterior (HOX-code) and dorsal–ventral (IRX, PAX) patterning of the neural tube  
• Neural progenitor proliferation/ cell-cycle (E2F family, MCM genes)  
• Early neurogenesis, neuronal migration and axon guidance (SOX2/3/11, EBF3, RFX4, GLI, RUNX, ROBO3, DCC-related genes)  
• Neural-crest specification (SOX10/5, FOXD3) – consistent with transient early accessibility  
Thus the cluster represents cis-regulatory elements that coordinate spinal-cord formation, motor-/inter-neuron specification and neural-crest emergence during gastrulation–early organogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment, coupled with mRNA co-expression, highlights:  
• HOX paralogs (HOXB4/5/6, HOXC6, HOXD9/10/11/12/13) – axial identity  
• SOX family (SOX2, SOX3, SOX5, SOX10, SOX11) – neuro-ectodermal competence and neurogenesis  
• IRX/PAX (IRX3/5/7, PAX6/7) – dorsal–ventral patterning  
• NKX1.2 / UNCX & FOX (FOXD3, FOXA2) – ventral spinal-cord & neural-crest regulators  
• RFX4 – cilia‐ and floor-plate associated gene program  
Secondary contributors: E2F (cycling progenitors), MEF2/NEUROD (onset of neuronal differentiation) and NR/retinoic-acid-receptor motifs (RA signalling that gates HOX expression).

In summary, peak-cluster 21_4 encompasses enhancers/promoters that are maximally accessible in trunk spinal-cord progenitors during 10–18 hpf, driving HOX- and SOX-dependent transcriptional networks that pattern the neural tube, initiate neurogenesis and briefly support early neural-crest identity.
]

## Cluster 21_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 21_5 – concise biological interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already appreciable at the 0–5-somite stage but climbs steadily through segmentation, reaching its maximum during late somitogenesis / early organogenesis (≈20–30 somites, 18–24 hpf).  
• The continuous rise, rather than a transient pulse, suggests that the elements in this cluster are used throughout neurogenesis and become most active when neurons start wiring up and functional regionalisation of the neural tube is under way.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest values)  
• Spinal cord (esp. generic spinal cord and floor-plate pseudobulks) – up to ~57 units at 30 som.  
• Differentiating / pan-neurons and hindbrain – 30–40 units.  
• Neural crest, mid-brain/hind-brain boundary, optic and posterior neural tube populations.  
• Only moderate accessibility in mesoderm-derived tissues (NMPs, PSM, somite) and negligible in endoderm or mesenchyme.  
⇒ Cluster 21_5 is a “pan-neural / posterior CNS” regulatory module with an antero-posterior gradient (Hindbrain < Spinal cord).

3. Likely biological programme  
Gene set is highly enriched for:  
• Axon guidance / neurite outgrowth: TENM2, ROBO2, SEMA5B, Wnt4/7ab, Nav3, Prickle2b.  
• Synaptic specification & scaffolding: DLG1, DLGAP1a, RIMS1b, NLgn3a, CTNNA2, NCAM1a/b, NEGR1.  
• Neuronal ion-handling & excitability: multiple ATPases (Atp1a1b, Atp2b3/4, Atp2b3b, Slc8a4a), Ca²⁺/HCO₃⁻ transporters (Ca16b, Slc4a4a).  
• Transcription factors of neuronal subtype identity (olig3, nfia, tshz1, irx4b, msx1b).  
Together with the temporal profile, these points to enhancers that orchestrate late neurogenesis: refinement of positional identity (HOX/Irx), birth of neurons, axon path-finding and early synaptogenesis in the hindbrain–spinal cord axis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene list coherence)  
• SOX family (Sox2/3/19b/21/11/14/10) – neural stem/progenitor maintenance and early differentiation.  
• HOX–Pbx/Meis complex – rostro-caudal patterning of hindbrain and spinal cord; strong and diverse HOX, PBX, MEIS motif presence.  
• PAX (Pax6/7/3/2/8/5) and IRX factors – dorsal/ventral patterning and neural column identity.  
• bHLH proneural / neurogenic factors (Atoh1a/b, NeuroD1/4/6, Olig2, Ascl1) – neuronal commitment and subtype specification.  
• RFX and NFIA/NFIX – ciliogenesis and glial/neuronal maturation signatures that typically emerge at 20 + som stages.  
• Nuclear receptors (COUP-TF/Nr2f, ROR, RXR) – often act with HOX/PBX to fine-tune segmental identity and axon guidance genes.  

Summary  
Cluster 21_5 marks a set of enhancers that progressively activate across the neural plate/tube, peaking in hindbrain and (especially) spinal-cord derivatives during late somitogenesis.  These elements integrate SOX–HOX/PBX/MEIS–PAX regulatory inputs to drive neuronal differentiation, regional identity, axon guidance and early synaptic assembly along the posterior central nervous system.
]

## Cluster 21_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 21_6 corresponds to a “paraxial-mesoderm / early-somite” regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises abruptly at the start of segmentation (0- to 5-somite stage, ≈10-11 hpf), stays maximal through 10-20 somites (≈12-18 hpf) and collapses by the 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf).  
   • The sharp drop at 30 somites in Somite and PSM pseudobulks (e.g. Somites: 51 → 12) marks the transition from segment formation to differentiated myotome/dermatome.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest → lowest)  
   • Newly formed somites  
   • Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) & tail-bud neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs)  
   • Early trunk/tail notochord and nascent muscle fibres  
   • Most neural, endodermal or ectodermal populations show only baseline signal.

3. Regulatory programme encoded  
   The associated gene set is enriched for classical segmentation, axial-patterning and early myogenic factors:  
   • Segment‐clock / mesoderm commitment: msgn1, her7, mespab, tbx6, tbx16, tbxta/tbxtb  
   • A–P patterning: cdx1a, cdx4; extensive Hox clusters (Hoxb/c/d 3-10)  
   • Wnt/Fgf/RA interface: fgf8a, fgf12/13, wnt5b, cyp26a1  
   • Onset of myogenesis & ECM assembly: myf5, mef2 family, col5/7/11/14, fn1b  
   Collectively these loci drive somite segmentation, rostro-caudal identity and the shift to early skeletal-muscle and axial-skeleton programmes.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene presence)  
   • T-box: Tbx6, Tbx16, Tbxta – core activators of paraxial mesoderm identity  
   • bHLH segmentation clock: Msgn1, Her/Hey factors, Mespab  
   • CDX & Hox/Pbx/Meis – confer axial positional code  
   • LEF1/TCF & β-catenin effectors – consistent with strong Wnt drive in PSM/NMPs  
   • MEF2 / Myf5 – initiation of muscle differentiation within maturing somites  
   • FOXC/FOXF and GATA factors appear but at lower enrichment, fitting later dermomyotome/sclerotome contributions.

In summary, peak-cluster 21_6 demarcates regulatory elements that are transiently open during the segmentation window in paraxial mesoderm cells, orchestrating somite formation, anterior-posterior Hox patterning and the earliest steps of skeletal-muscle differentiation under the control of Tbx6/16, Msgn1, CDX-Hox and Wnt-responsive TFs.

## Cluster 22_0

[*assistant*:
Biological annotation of peak-cluster 22_0  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already detectable at the 0- to 5-somite stage (log-values ≈4.5–5) but rises steadily during segmentation.  
• The signal reaches a clear maximum between 20- and 30-somites (24 hpf).  Highest values are seen at 20 s and peak at 30 s in most neuro-ectodermal populations (differentiating neurons, neural/optic cup, hind-/midbrain, spinal cord).  The extremely high value for Epidermis_30 s (≈90) is an obvious outlier and most likely technical.  

2. Cell-type specificity (top accessible samples)  
• Differentiating neurons (CNS pan-neurons, hind-/midbrain boundary, spinal cord)  
• Optic cup / neural-optic lineage  
• Cranial neural-crest–derived neurons & pharyngeal arch mesenchyme  
• Somitic muscle and fast-muscle show moderate signal; other germ-layer derivatives stay low.  
Taken together, the cluster is most characteristic of late-segmental neuroectoderm and its neural-crest derivatives.  

3. Inferred regulatory programme  
Gene set: dense in neuronal adhesion/axon-guidance and synaptic genes (CNTNAP2a, CNTN5, GABRB2, GRIN2bb, RYR2, CACNA1C, ANK3a, SCN8ab, NPAS3, RBFOX3b).  Presence of ALDH1A3 plus many RAR/RXR motifs indicates retinoic-acid responsiveness—a hallmark of hind-/spinal neurogenesis.  
Biological processes likely controlled:  
• Neurogenesis and neuronal subtype maturation (axon extension, synaptogenesis, channel/ receptor deployment)  
• Rostro-caudal patterning of the neural tube by HOX/RA code  
• Migration/differentiation of cranial neural-crest neurons  
• Secondary contributions to myogenic programmes (MEF2/TCF motifs) in neighbouring somites.  

4. Candidate driver transcription factors (motifs highly enriched in the cluster)  
• RA nuclear-receptor family RARα/β/γ, RXRα/β/γ – explains RA-responsive gene set  
• TALE homeodomain partners PBX1/2/3/4 and MEIS1/2/3 + PKNOX – classic co-factors for HOX-mediated hindbrain/spinal patterning  
• HOX, DLX, LHX clusters – positional identity and neuronal subtype specification  
• SOX family (SOX2/3/10/11/21) – neural progenitor maintenance and early neuronal fate  
• FOX family (FOXO3/4, FOXG1, FOXC/F/O sub-classes) – neurodevelopmental and cranial-crest regulators  
• PAX6/7 and PAX3 – dorsal neural-tube / neural-crest determinants  
• bHLH neurogenic factors NEUROD/ATOH/OLIG + MEF2 – terminal neuronal/muscle differentiation  
• CREB/ATF & BATF/JUN (AP-1) – activity-dependent neuronal gene expression  

Summary  
Peak-cluster 22_0 marks a set of retinoic-acid– and HOX/TALE-controlled enhancers that switch on late in segmentation (20–30 somites) in neuroectodermal and cranial neural-crest lineages to drive neuronal maturation, axon-guidance and synaptic programmes, with subsidiary activity in adjacent somitic muscle.
]

## Cluster 22_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 22_1 is a classical “late epidermis/periderm” module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises gradually across epidermal pseudobulks (≈15 som – 20 som) but shows a >6-fold jump at 30 somites (24 hpf: 103.9 vs ≤17 in all other samples).  
   • Other lineages remain flat (~12-16), indicating the burst is time-restricted to the end of our sampling window.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • By far the highest signal is in Epidermis_30 somites; earlier epidermis samples are next highest.  
   • All non-epidermal cell types stay at background. The cluster therefore marks differentiating surface ectoderm/periderm cells.

3. Likely biological programme  
   Gene list is enriched for:  
   - Junction/adhesion & barrier genes (krt222, cldn15b/17, tjp1a/2b, cdh11/13/24, itga5/9, itgb4/5/8)  
   - Epidermal cytoskeleton/ECM regulators (actl6b, alcama/b, fn1a, lama/b, tnc)  
   - Signalling components involved in epidermal morphogenesis and wound barrier (wnt3/3a/7, fgf10a, bmp7b, tgfb3, notch1a/2, irf6)  
   Together with the timing, this points to establishment of the protective epithelial barrier and maturation of basal & periderm layers during early larval skin formation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and TF-mapping highlight the canonical epidermal transcriptional circuitry:  
   • p63 / Tp63 (motif group with tp63, tp73, tp53) – master TF for basal epidermis  
   • Grainyhead-like factors Grhl1 / Grhl2 (motif group 30/44) – periderm sealing, barrier genes  
   • TFAP2 family (tfap2a/b/c/d/e) – surface ectoderm specification  
   • KLF family (klf4/5/6/17 etc.; motif group 86/87) – stratification, keratin gene activation  
   • AP-1 complex (Jun, Fos, Batf; motif groups 43, 75, 79) – late differentiation, wound response  
   • IRF6 (motif group 21) – links p63 to periderm differentiation  
   • SP/TFCP2 & REST/CTCF motifs also present, consistent with widespread remodeling of chromatin loops around epidermal gene clusters.

In sum, peak-cluster 22_1 represents a set of enhancers/promoters that switch on specifically in epidermal cells as the zebrafish embryo transitions into larval skin, driven by the p63–GRHL–TFAP2–KLF regulatory network.
]

## Cluster 22_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 22_2 marks a broad “neuronal differentiation / posterior neural‐tube” programme that gradually switches on during somitogenesis and peaks at early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low-to-moderate (∼3–5) at 0–10-somite stages but rises at 15–30 somites, with the highest signals at 20–30 somites (e.g. NMP 30 som, epidermis 30 som and tail-bud 30 som outliers).  
   • This timing (∼18–24 hpf) coincides with robust neurogenesis and axon-pathway formation in the hind-/spinal cord.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in posterior neuroectodermal derivatives:  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) and tail-bud tissue – the source of caudal spinal cord neurons.  
   • Differentiating neurons, hindbrain, spinal cord and neural-crest subsets.  
   (Large values in “epidermis 30 som” likely reflect tail-bud surface ectoderm that co-clusters with NMPs rather than true skin.)

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
   Gene set is enriched for:  
   • Axon guidance / synaptogenesis: sema3aa, sema6e, epha7, ephb2/3, robo1, nav3, grid1/2, grik2/4, gabrb3, ntrk3a, unc5a/c/d.  
   • Neuronal cytoskeleton & projection growth: daam1b, dock4, ppp1r9a (neurofilin), myo10, kinesins, kcn/kat potassium channels.  
   • Posterior neural patterning & Hox cofactors: many Hoxa/b/c/d genes, meis1/2/3, pbx1–4.  
   • Cell-cycle exit and maturation: mef2cb, rps6ka2, atg7, mtor regulators (acss2, ppar).  
   Together they point to the transition of posterior neural progenitors into differentiated motor/inter-neurons and the wiring of their axons.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene list)  
   • Sox family (Sox2/3/5/11/14/19) – maintain neural progenitors and initiate neurogenic fate.  
   • Hox + Pbx/Meis partnership – pattern caudal hindbrain and spinal cord segments.  
   • Fox factors (FoxD3/D5/I2/I3, FoxG1) – dorsal–ventral neural identity and progenitor maintenance.  
   • Irx and Pax (Irx1/3/5/7, Pax2/3/6/8) – columnar pattern and sensory interneuron specification.  
   • Mef2 / Runx / NF-E2-related factors – promote neuronal maturation and cytoskeletal remodelling.  
   • AP-1/ATF/BATF (fos/jun family) – activity-dependent chromatin opening as axons extend.

In summary, peak-cluster 22_2 represents enhancers that become most accessible late in somitogenesis in posterior neural progenitors and differentiating spinal/hindbrain neurons, orchestrated by Sox–Fox–Hox/Pbx/Meis TF combinations to drive neuronal differentiation, axon guidance and maturation along the posterior axis.
]

## Cluster 22_3

[*assistant*:
Interpretation of ATAC-peak cluster 22_3  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is essentially baseline (log₂-scale ≈3) from 0- to 20-somite stages but rises steeply at 30-somites (24 hpf).  
• Two cell–time combinations show a “burst” of open chromatin:  
  – Epidermis_30 som = 87.6 (≈25-fold above baseline)  
  – Neural-telencephalon_30 som = 47.3 (≈15-fold above baseline)  
This indicates that the regulatory elements in cluster 22_3 are switched on late, during early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is confined to:  
• Surface ectoderm / epidermis (periderm + basal keratinocytes) at 30 somites  
• Anterior neural tube derivatives, in particular telencephalic neuro-epithelium at the same stage  
Low-level accessibility (3–4) in most other tissues suggests these peaks are not completely silenced elsewhere but become strongly activated only in the two ectodermal compartments above.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
Gene/GO themes derived from the >800 linked genes point to:  
• Epidermal maturation & barrier formation – keratin krt1-19d, transglutaminase tgm1l1, ECM/ basement-membrane genes (frasa1, col18a1, comp, adamts family, tnc), Fras/Frem complex, Lrp2.  
• Neurite outgrowth / synapse assembly – neurexins (nrxn2/3), neuroligins, nrp/sem a4, tnc, rspo2, dpysl4, ror2, cacna/ryr Ca²⁺ channels, tyrosine-hydroxylase (th).  
• Wnt / BMP modulation (rspo2, fras1, adamtsl3, fras1) – typical of periderm–neural tube cross-talk.  
Taken together, cluster 22_3 appears to coordinate late ectodermal programmes that (i) solidify the skin barrier and (ii) tune axon-guidance/synaptic genes in the forebrain.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene links)  
• AP-1 / ATF family – fos, jun, atf3/jdp2 motifs highly enriched; fits epidermal stress-responsive enhancer activation.  
• MITF/TFE leucine-zipper group – mitfa/tfec/tfe3 motifs mark pigment-cell/periderm enhancers.  
• SOX & FOX paralogues – broad ectodermal competence, especially Sox2/3/14/19 and Foxp/Foxd motifs.  
• PAX6 / IRX – forebrain-specific neuro-epithelial factors; both motifs enriched and genes expressed.  
• KLF/SP & CEBP family – keratinocyte differentiation/basal layer genes.  
• RFX / GATA3 – ciliogenesis and epidermal-junction genes, respectively.

Overall, peak-cluster 22_3 demarcates a late-stage ectodermal enhancer set that is sharply up-regulated in surface epidermis and anterior neural tube, driven by AP-1, MITF/TFE, SOX/FOX and PAX6/IRX factors to orchestrate skin-barrier maturation and simultaneous wiring of early telencephalic neurons.
]

## Cluster 22_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 22_4 marks a vascular / hemato-endothelial regulatory program that turns on soon after gastrulation and strengthens through early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• 1-somite / shield stages: low basal accessibility.  
• 5- to 15-somite (11–19 hpf): sharp activation in haemangioblasts (≈15 reads) and nascent vasculature.  
• 20- to 30-somite (22–24 hpf): reaches maximum, peaking in hematopoietic-vasculature pseudobulks (≈31 reads) and in surface ectoderm/epidermis at 30-somites (≈94 reads).  
Thus the cluster is most active during the transition from haemangioblasts to mature endothelial cells, with a late boost in epidermal barrier cells.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Hemangioblasts → hematopoietic/vascular endothelium  
• Surface ectoderm / epidermis (particularly at 30 somites)  
Secondary but appreciable signal: NMP-derived mesoderm, PSM, differentiating neurons.

3. Regulated biological processes  
Gene set is enriched for vascular and endothelial functions:  
- vasculogenesis / angiogenic sprouting (egfl7, ccbe1, esama, fli1a, lmo2, fgd5a, itga4)  
- endothelial junction & barrier formation (cldn5b, cavin1b, esama, aqp1a, ROCK2, RASA2)  
- cytoskeletal remodelling and cell migration (PKN2, TAGAP, ASAP2/3, ROCK2, FHOD1)  
- hematopoietic specification (tal1/tal2, kitlga, runx1-associated factors)  
- lipid/sterol transport important for membrane biogenesis (abca1a, abcc3, slc25a1)

Together these point to the programme that builds, stabilises and remodels the embryonic vasculature while supporting early blood progenitors and the developing epidermal barrier.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene list)  
ETS family – Fli1a, Etv2/Etv5, Erg (master regulators of endothelial fate)  
GATA factors – Gata2/3/6 (hemato-vascular and epithelial enhancers)  
Runx1/3 – definitive hematopoietic emergence  
KLF family – Klf2/6/9/17 (flow-responsive endothelial maintenance)  
FOXC / FOXA / FOXF – vessel morphogenesis and epithelial polarity  
TAL1/LMO2 + PBX/MEIS – hemangioblast specification  
E2F factors – proliferative expansion of endothelial precursors  
BATF/JUN (AP-1) – junction and barrier maturation in epidermis

In summary, peak-cluster 22_4 captures an endothelial/hemangioblast enhancer set that fires from mid-somite stages, driving genes and transcription factors required for blood-vessel formation, endothelial maturation and, secondarily, epidermal barrier construction.
]

## Cluster 22_5

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 22_5 – summary interpretation

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest at 0–10 som (10–14 hpf), rises steadily through 15–20 som, and shows a dramatic jump at 30 som (~24 hpf).  
• The late-stage surge indicates that the cis-regulatory elements in this cluster are activated chiefly during early organogenesis rather than during gastrulation or early segmentation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility (normalised signal)  
• Epidermis (surface ectoderm) – by far the strongest signal (≈107 at 30 som, >10-fold above most other pseudobulks).  
Elevated (but lower) signals  
• Neural-crest derivatives / craniofacial mesenchyme: pharyngeal arches, enteric- and peripheral-neurons, hindbrain.  
• Contractile / mesenchymal tissues: heart myocardium, skeletal muscle, somites.  
• Endocrine pancreas and lateral-plate mesoderm exhibit moderate early accessibility but do not show the late spike.  
Taken together, the pattern is consistent with CREs that become most open in the maturing periderm/basal epidermal layer and in mesenchymal cell populations that interact with, or migrate beneath, the epidermis.

3. Likely regulatory programme  
Gene set is heavily enriched for extracellular-matrix and cell-adhesion molecules (col6a1, col12a1a/b, lama1, itga1/5/9/11, angpt1, has2, tgfbi, tgfbr3, slit3, sema3c/6e, bmp5, wnt10a). These genes mediate:  
• Assembly of basement membrane and dermal ECM.  
• Integrin/FAK signalling that supports epithelial sheet tension and epidermal–mesenchymal interactions.  
• Guidance/EMT pathways used by neural-crest and craniofacial mesenchyme.  
• TGF-β/Wnt/BMP cues that pattern skin, connective tissue and outgrowing facial/heart structures.  
Thus cluster 22_5 captures a late epidermal–mesenchymal/ECM remodelling programme crucial for skin maturation, craniofacial morphogenesis and heart/muscle extracellular support.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs enriched)  
• AP-1 family (Fos/Jun; motifs in groups 22 & 79) – classic epidermal/ECM activators.  
• NRF/Bach oxidative-stress regulators (Nfe2l1/2/3, Bach1/2) – linked to keratinocyte maturation and redox control during ECM deposition.  
• p63 / TP53 family (tp63, tp73 motifs in group 51) – master regulators of stratified epithelia.  
• TFAP2 & TEAD/TEF (group 82) – promote epidermal differentiation and Hippo-mediated sheet growth.  
• EMT / mesenchyme factors: TWIST1/2, SNAI1/2, HAND2, RUNX1/2/3, SP8 – consistent with neural-crest migration and craniofacial mesenchyme.  
• Forkhead and Sox classes (FOXF/C, FOXP1, SOX9/10) – coordinate dermal–neural-crest signalling.  
Collectively these TFs underpin the switch to a high-ECM, adhesion-rich transcriptional state in the epidermis and adjacent mesenchyme at 24 hpf.
]

## Cluster 22_6

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 22_6 captures a coherent ectoderm / neural-crest regulatory program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already elevated at 0–5 somites (≈10–12 hpf) but increases steadily, peaking at 20–30 somites (≈19–24 hpf).  
   • Epidermal pseudobulks rise from 14–16 (0–5 somites) to an extreme 121 (30 somites), indicating maximal activity during late segmentation and early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signal)  
   • Surface ectoderm / epidermis (all stages, dominant at 10–30 somites)  
   • Migratory neural-crest populations (neural crest, enteric neurons, pharyngeal-arch mesenchyme)  
   • Moderate signal in NMPs and differentiating neurons; low in mesoderm / endoderm.

3. Biological processes likely regulated  
   • Epithelial/epidermal maturation: keratins (krt5, krt17), laminins (lamb1a, lamc2), tp63, irf6.  
   • Neural-crest EMT and migration: sox10, foxd3, pax3/7, tfec, wnt2bb/9a, bmp5/7b, mmp14/15, integrins (itga6, itgb5/6).  
   • Extracellular-matrix organisation and cranio-facial skeletogenesis: col1a1, col11/12/14, runx2a/b, mplk2, tnc.  
   • Chromatin / signalling modulators that maintain multipotency (kdm2ba, lin28, acvr2aa).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
   • SOX family (SOX10/SOX11/SOX5/SOX21) – neural-crest specification & EMT.  
   • FOX factors (FOXD3, FOXK1/2, FOXG1, FOXL1/2) – ectoderm & cranial-crest competence.  
   • TFAP2 / GRHL / IRF6 / TP63 – epidermal-periderm enhancers, barrier formation.  
   • PAX3/PAX7 and KDM2B – sustain neural-crest progenitors.  
   • MITF-family TFEC, RUNX2, TWIST – pigment and mesenchymal lineages emerging from crest.  
   • MEF2/TEAD & AP-1 (FOS/JUN, BATF) motifs support cytoskeletal/ECM remodelling.

Together these peaks act as late-segmentation enhancers that switch on and amplify genes required for epidermal differentiation and for neural-crest-derived cell migration and early differentiation, explaining their strong, late, surface-ectoderm and neural-crest accessibility profile.
]

## Cluster 22_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 22_7 captures a “surface-ectoderm / epidermal program” that is switched on transiently in the early optic cup and then becomes very strongly activated in the maturing epidermis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Modest accessibility (≈3-fold over background) from 0–20-somite stages.  
   • Early spike at 5-somites in the optic cup (29.7-fold).  
   • Dramatic late activation at 30-somites (≈24 hpf): epidermis signal jumps to 85-fold—the highest value in the entire matrix.  
   →  The cluster is therefore most active during late organogenesis (24 hpf), with a brief earlier pulse during eye-field evagination.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in surface-ectoderm–derived tissues:  
   • Epidermis / periderm (especially at 30-somites).  
   • Optic-cup epithelium (5-somites).  
   Lower, but above-background, signals are present in other superficial ectoderm derivatives (pharyngeal arches, hatching gland) and virtually absent from mesodermal or endodermal populations.

3. Putative regulatory programme  
   Gene set and motif content point to epithelial barrier formation and ECM remodelling:  
   • Structural / adhesion genes: cdh13, col6a4a, col12a1a, mmp14a, adam10a, adamts8a, muc2.2, itgb7.  
   • Secreted/ECM patterning: sparcl1, scospondin, impg1a (corneal/retinal matrix).  
   • Signalling components linked to epidermal or ocular development: kdr (Vegfr2), egfra, il34, nrip1a.  
   Biological processes therefore include periderm/epidermis differentiation, corneal/optic-cup epithelial maturation, matrix deposition and metalloprotease-driven tissue shaping.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & TF-gene presence)  
   • p63 / TP63 (tp63 motif in set 51) – master regulator of stratified epithelium.  
   • TFAP2 family (tfap2a/b/c/e; motif set 101) – activates epidermal and lens programmes.  
   • GRHL (grhl1/2; motif set 30 & 44) – periderm barrier genes.  
   • IRF6 / IRF family (motif sets 21 & 83) – epithelial morphogenesis and periderm integrity.  
   • KLF cluster (klf4/5/9/17; sets 86 & 87) – epidermal differentiation and barrier genes.  
   • Pax6 / Rx / Vsx motifs (sets 23, 30, 49) – consistent with the optic-cup peak at 5-somites.  
   • AP-1/Nrf/Jun-Fos and NFE2L (set 79, 43) – cooperate with TFAP2/IRF6 during epithelial morphogenesis.

Together, these features indicate that peak-cluster 22_7 marks enhancers that drive superficial ectoderm identity—first in the nascent eye and later in the maturing epidermis—and are regulated by the canonical TF triad TFAP2–p63–GRHL with support from IRF6, KLFs and Pax6-family factors.
]

## Cluster 22_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 22_8 marks a broad “late-neuronal” regulatory programme that turns on during mid–late somitogenesis and is shared by many neuronal lineages, with secondary use in late epidermis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises steadily from gastrulation-stage neural progenitors to its maximum at 30-somite (~24 hpf).  
   • Example: differentiating-neurons 0 s = 6.5 → 22 s = 22.3; enteric-neurons 0 s = 11.3 → 30 s = 35.5; epidermis jumps sharply by 30 s (102), indicating an additional late epithelial usage.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signal)  
   • CNS/PNS neuronal derivatives – differentiating neurons (brain & spinal cord), enteric neurons, hindbrain, spinal cord, neural floor-plate/optic lineages.  
   • Moderate in neuromesodermal progenitor/PSM derivatives; negligible in mesendodermal tissues.  
   • Late epidermis/periderm shows an isolated spike, suggesting shared enhancers reused by skin at 24 hpf.

3. Biological processes likely regulated  
   Gene set is enriched for:
   • Neuronal differentiation & maturation – axon guidance (ret, robo3, sema6, ephb2), neurite outgrowth (prickle2, daam1a), synapse assembly/vesicle cycling (nrxn1-3, syngap1b, rims2, syt7, stx17).  
   • Electrical excitability – voltage- and calcium-channel genes (kcn family, cacna1bb, trpc5, adcy8).  
   • Cell adhesion & extracellular matrix shaping needed for neural circuit wiring (cadh/cntn/kirrel, col14a1/16a1, adam/adamts).  
   • A minor epidermal program (keratinocyte ECM/remodelling genes) explains the epidermis 30 s peak.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched in cluster 22_8)  
   • SOX-C / SOX-B group: Sox4/11/2/3 – promote neurogenesis and neurite extension.  
   • PAX family: Pax6, Pax3/7, Pax2/8 – regional neural patterning and sensory neuron identity.  
   • LIM-/homeodomain factors: Lhx1/2/4/9, Isl1/2, Lmx1a/b, Dlx1/2/5 – subtype specification and axon path-finding.  
   • HOX factors (multiple anterior-posterior codes) – spinal/hindbrain positional identity.  
   • FOX family (FoxP1/2/4, FoxD3/5, FoxG1) – neuronal subtype maturation and neural-crest-derived PNS.  
   • MEF2 and RUNX motifs – activity-dependent neuronal maturation.  
   • bHLH proneural/neuronal (NeuroD/Neurog/ATOH, TF query sets 15 & 42) – terminal differentiation.  
   Collectively these TFs align with late neurogenic waves that build functional circuits at 18-24 hpf.

Summary: Peak-cluster 22_8 represents enhancers that switch on during mid-to-late somitogenesis, are used most intensely by differentiating CNS/PNS neurons (and secondarily by late epidermis), and control genes required for axon guidance, synapse formation and neuronal excitability under the combinatorial control of SOX, PAX, LIM-homeodomain, HOX and FOX transcription-factor families.
]

## Cluster 22_9

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 22_9 – Biological synopsis  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is low-to-moderate from gastrulation through the 20-somite stage but leaps upward at the 30-somite stage (≈ 24 hpf).  
• The jump is especially striking in epidermal pseudobulks (∼18-fold over earlier stages) and, to a lesser extent, in late enteric-neuron and differentiating-neuron pseudobulks.  
⇒ The cluster marks a late-embryonic, “switch-on” programme.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signals at 30 somites in:  
• Epidermis / periderm (by far the strongest)  
• Enteric-neurons (neural-crest derivative)  
• Moderate in differentiating central/peripheral neurons and in neural-crest bulk.  
⇒ It is an ectoderm-biased module, maxing out in surface epithelium but also reused in neural-crest–derived peripheral lineages.

3. Underlying regulatory/biological programme  
Gene set and motif composition point to:  
• Epithelial maturation & barrier formation – adhesion (cadm1a/2a, cdh2/23, fn1a), ECM remodeling (col28a1a, adam15, adamts14), junctional/ polarity genes (pard3ba, claudin-like genes), BMP4 signalling.  
• Neural-crest migration / peripheral-neuron differentiation – axon-guidance and synaptic genes (npas3, nrg2a, gria/grin family, robo1, slit1/3, runx2a).  
• Cell-shape/ motility genes (ablima/b, rock2b, ror2) consistent with late epithelial morphogenesis and neurite extension.

4. Key transcription-factor signals (motifs with top z-scores & represented TF families)  
• Grainyhead/Grhl (grhl2a, grhl1) – canonical periderm/epidermis drivers.  
• TFAP2 family (tfap2c/b) & p63 (tp63) – epidermal differentiation, cranial-neural-crest.  
• Sox cluster (Sox10/9/6/5/21) – ectoderm & neural-crest gene control.  
• Fox cluster (Foxd3, Foxi1/3, Foxg1, Foxk) – epithelial polarity and crest migration.  
• Pax3/7 & Pax6/8 – neural-crest and peripheral-neuron identity.  
• IRF6 / IRF10 – periderm integrity and epithelial fusion pathways.  
• KLF/GRHL/Keratin-regulating factors (Klf17/9; Grhl) – reinforce epithelial gene expression.  
• E2F/FOXM1 – cell-cycle motifs at lower levels, fitting terminal amplification of epidermal progenitors just before differentiation.

Combined interpretation  
Peak cluster 22_9 corresponds to a late-embryonic enhancer set that is abruptly activated as the zebrafish epidermis/periderm terminally differentiates and as neural-crest-derived peripheral neurons (notably enteric neurons) begin maturation.  The motif landscape implicates the classic epidermal triad (Grhl–Tfap2/p63–Irf6) together with Sox/Fox/Pax regulators that bridge surface ectoderm and neural-crest lineages, orchestrating adhesion-ECM remodelling and neurite-outgrowth gene programmes required for skin barrier formation and peripheral-nervous-system wiring at 24 hpf.

## Cluster 22_10

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 22_10 represents a surface-ectoderm/epithelial program that turns on late in somitogenesis and is most prominent in the maturing skin, with an earlier, briefer pulse in the forming optic cup.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest (≈2–3 a.u.) from 0- to 20-somite stages, spikes in the optic cup at 10 som (40 a.u.), and shows a dramatic surge at 30 som/24 hpf in epidermis (87 a.u.).  
   • The pattern suggests an early, transient role during eye morphogenesis followed by a major activation during late skin maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Surface ectoderm / epidermis – strongest at 30 som.  
   • Optic cup epithelium – sharp peak at 10 som.  
   • Minor but consistent accessibility in other epithelial derivatives (endocrine pancreas, endoderm, hemangioblasts) but at background levels compared with epidermis/optic cup.

3. Likely regulated biological processes  
   • Epidermal terminal differentiation and barrier formation – presence of keratin-associated genes (e.g. krt-like collagens, cornification/ECM genes col6a3, col21a1, col4a6; adhesion genes cntn3, kirrel3; lipid-handling genes abcg1, mgat4/5).  
   • Epithelial morphogenesis and apical constriction (shroom2, syne1, rimbp2).  
   • Eye-field/optic cup patterning (wnt9a, nrg1, pax-/rx-associated factors in motif list).  
   • General extracellular-matrix remodelling and glycosylation required for epithelial sheet stability.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs enriched in this cluster)  
   • p63/TP73 – master regulator of epidermal stratification (motif set 51).  
   • TFAP2 family – activates epidermal and eye ectoderm genes (motif set 15, 41, 42).  
   • PAX6 / SOX2 / SIX3-6 – canonical eye-field factors explaining the early optic-cup peak (motif sets 7, 9, 17, 34).  
   • FOX (FOXI3/FOXL2/FOXK) and DLX/ALX homeodomain factors – drive general surface-ectoderm and craniofacial epithelium programs (motif sets 2–4, 68).  
   • AP-1 / Nrf (FOS/JUN, NFE2L1/2) – stress-response and keratinocyte activation components (motif sets 22, 43, 79).  

Overall, peak cluster 22_10 marks enhancers that are first used in the optic cup and are then massively redeployed in the surface ectoderm as zebrafish embryos transition to a fully differentiated skin epithelium by 24 hpf.

## Cluster 22_11

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 22_11 – concise interpretation

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest at early segmentation (0-10 somites) and rises steadily, peaking at 24 hpf (≈30-somite stage).  
• The jump is especially striking in epidermis where the signal leaps from 9.8 (20 som) to 94.8 (30 som), indicating a late, switch-like activation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is seen in epithelia that give rise to motile-ciliated or secretory surface cells:  
• Epidermis/periderm – dominating signal at 30 som.  
• Hatching-gland cells – high between 5-20 som; these superficial secretory cells are also ciliated.  
• Endocrine-pancreas and general endoderm show moderate, progressive accessibility.  
Pronephros, floor-plate and neural tube derivatives display only baseline levels, underscoring epidermal preference.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
The correlated gene set is strongly enriched for axoneme and ciliary assembly components (DYNC2H1, DNAH11/7, CCDC65, CFAP100/58, PKHD1L1, RFX-target genes, etc.), together with vesicle-trafficking and apical membrane determinants (EXOC4, RAB11FIP1, STXBP5L).  
Functional theme: formation/maturation of motile multiciliated epithelial cells and establishment of the mucociliary/secretory epidermal barrier during late segmentation-to-pharyngula stages.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment and TF–motif mapping point to the canonical ciliogenesis module:  
• RFX family (RFX2/3/4/5/7) – central activators of axonemal gene batteries.  
• E2F4/5 (+DP partners) – cooperate with MCIDAS/GEMC1 in multiciliogenesis.  
• FOXJ1 / FOX family (FOXI/F) – master regulator of motile cilia; FOX motifs are prominent.  
• MYB and TP73 – additional MCC regulators (MYB motif present; TP53/73 family motifs enriched).  
Surface-epithelial factors that likely help specify the lineage: TFAP2 (ap2 family), GRHL1/2, TP63 and KLF5/17 clusters.

Taken together, peak cluster 22_11 marks the late-stage activation of the motile-ciliated epidermal/secretory epithelial gene programme, driven predominantly by RFX–E2F–FOXJ1 transcriptional circuitry.
]

## Cluster 22_12

[*assistant*:
Peak Cluster 22_12 – concise interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is generally low-moderate from 0-15 somites but shows a sharp spike at the 20-somite stage (≈ 19–20 hpf).  
• Signal drops again by 30 somites, indicating a transient activation window around early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• The dominant signal is in epidermis_20somites (≈ 86-fold higher than background), with only modest (~2–3 fold) accessibility in most other tissues.  
• Minor secondary accessibility is seen in late differentiating neurons and some neural boundary populations, but epidermal cells clearly drive this cluster.

3. Putative regulatory programme  
• Associated genes include classic epidermal / basal-keratinocyte markers and adhesion components (tp63, tgm1, itga6/itgb4, lama/col family, tnc, claudins, desmosomal cadherins).  
• Gene ontology patterns (barrier formation, cell–cell adhesion, hemidesmosome assembly, cornified envelope) and the time of activation point to basal epidermal maturation and initial stratification/periderm turnover that occur around 18-22 hpf in zebrafish.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif presence + gene association)  
High-confidence epidermal regulators detected in the motif table and/or gene list:  
• TP63 / TP73 family – master regulator of basal keratinocyte identity.  
• TFAP2 (a/b/c/d/e) – drives ectoderm/epidermis gene programmes.  
• GRHL (grhl1/2) – necessary for periderm integrity and barrier function.  
• KLF family (klf4/5/6/17) – promotes epidermal differentiation.  
• GATA3/6 – ectodermal epithelial co-factors.  
• RAR/RXR nuclear receptors (rarga/b, rxraa/b) – retinoic-acid-dependent epidermal patterning.  
• TEAD/TA (Hippo pathway) motifs and C/EBP factors (cebpb/cebpd) are also enriched, consistent with epithelial growth and barrier gene activation.

Taken together, Peak Cluster 22_12 marks a transient, epidermis-specific chromatin-accessibility wave at 20 somites that underpins the switch from proliferative surface ectoderm to differentiated basal keratinocytes/periderm, orchestrated by TP63-, TFAP2- and GRHL-centred transcriptional circuitry.
]

## Cluster 22_13

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 22_13 marks a late-somitogenesis, epidermis-centred regulatory program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
 • Accessibility is already detectable at the 0–10-somite stages (~10–14 hpf; values ≈4–5), rises further by 15–20 somites, and reaches a clear maximum at 30 somites (~24 hpf).  
 • The late surge indicates that the elements in this cluster become most active during the transition from late somitogenesis to early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
 • The strongest signal is in surface ectoderm/epidermis (epidermis-30 som = ~88, >10-fold higher than the bulk of other samples).  
 • Moderate but consistent accessibility (≈5–6) is seen in other epithelial or epithelial-like derivatives (endoderm, endocrine pancreas, heart myocardium, fast muscle, vasculature), whereas neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMP/PSM) show only basal levels.  
 • Taken together, the cluster is highly enriched in surface ectoderm, with secondary usage in several organ primordia that require epithelialisation.

3. Putative biological function  
 Associated genes are heavily enriched for:  
 • Extracellular-matrix and basement-membrane components (Col4a2/4a6/9a2/17a1b, Col18a1, Col27a1b, Lama/B, Fbn2).  
 • Cell-adhesion and junctional proteins (Cdh1/2/11, Itga10/11, Itgb4, Crb3, Prom1a).  
 • Cytoskeletal/contractility genes (Actn1/3, Myo5b, Fscn1b, Vasp, Piezo1/2).  
 • Matrix remodellers (Adamts3, Adamtsl3, Mmp-related), signalling modulators (Fgf11/12/14, Wnt‐/Tgf-auxiliary factors).  
 These signatures point to epithelial maturation, barrier formation, and ECM remodelling that accompany skin/periderm differentiation and the epithelialisation of emerging organs.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment and TF mapping highlight several cooperating TF groups:  
 • FOX family (FOXA/C/F, FOXD3/5, FOXK) – classic pioneers for epithelial and endodermal enhancers.  
 • SOX family (SOX2/3/5/8/9/21) – ectoderm/epidermis and progenitor maintenance factors.  
 • AP-1 / ATF / NRF module (FOS, JUN, ATF3, NFE2L1/2) – couples morphogenesis with mechanical and oxidative-stress responses typical of surface epithelia.  
 • HOX–PBX–MEIS axis – patterning inputs that turn on region-specific ECM genes.  
 • Nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, HNF4) – retinoid and metabolic control of epithelial programmes.  
 • TEAD/MEF2 and GATA factors appear as secondary contributors in muscle/endoderm sub-populations.

In summary, peak cluster 22_13 defines an enhancer set that becomes highly accessible in the epidermis at ~24 hpf and supports epithelial/ECM gene expression needed for skin barrier establishment and for epithelialisation of multiple organs, orchestrated primarily by FOX and SOX factors together with AP-1/NRF stress-responsive TFs and regional HOX-PBX inputs.
]

## Cluster 22_14

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 22_14 marks a late-forming, surface-ectoderm/epidermis–specific regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest and fairly uniform from gastrulation to ~15 somites, then rises steadily in epidermal pseudobulks, jumping sharply at 20 somites and reaching a maximal value at 30 somites (≈ 24 hpf).  
   • The step-wise increase indicates activation during transition from simple periderm to a mature, stratified epidermis and formation of the basal lamina.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest signals: Epidermis (all time points, strongest at 30 somites).  
   • Secondary but lower accessibility: surface-ectoderm derivatives such as pharyngeal arch ectomesenchyme and optic/otic epithelium; negligible in mesoderm or endoderm.  
   • Thus the cluster is largely restricted to non-neural ectoderm/skin cells.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
   • Epidermal differentiation & barrier formation – keratin (krt98), transglutaminase (tgm5l), cornified-envelope/ECM genes (col5a2/col14a1, lama1, tnc, matn3/4, spon1/2).  
   • Cell-adhesion and polarity – cadm1a, cdh7a/22/31, itga3/5, claudin/tight-junction components.  
   • Wound-responsive / AP-1 pathway genes (fos/jun family) and YAP1 target set, reflecting high proliferation of basal epidermis.  
   • Craniofacial positional genes (multiple Hox, Dlx, Lhx) appear because cranial epidermis and periderm carry regional Hox signatures.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
   Motif enrichment combined with the expressed TF list points to a canonical epidermal TF cocktail:  
   • TP63 / TP73 & TFAP2 family (motif group 51) – master regulators of vertebrate epidermis.  
   • Grainyhead-like factors GRHL1/3 (motif group 30) – promote skin-barrier genes and tight-junction assembly.  
   • IRF6 (motif group 21) – mediates periderm maturation downstream of p63/Grhl.  
   • KLF family (klf4/6/17/5) and GATA3/6 – support epithelial identity and barrier gene transcription.  
   • TEAD1/3 (motif group 82) partnering with YAP1 – consistent with high yap1 expression and the proliferative spike at 20–30 somites.  
   • AP-1 complex (FOS/JUN, motif group 79/43) – linked to epidermal stress and differentiation cues.

Taken together, peak cluster 22_14 demarcates enhancers that switch on late during somitogenesis to drive epidermal maturation, extracellular-matrix deposition and barrier formation, orchestrated principally by p63/TFAP2/GRHL/IRF6-TFs with YAP-TEAD and AP-1 inputs.
]

## Cluster 22_15

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 22_15 represents a late-stage, trunk-patterning regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises modestly between 0- and 20-somite stages and shows a pronounced jump at 30 somites (≈24 hpf) in most lineages.  
• The >10-fold signal in 30-somite samples (e.g. Epidermis_30 somites ≈ 88, Endocrine-pancreas_30 somites ≈ 51) indicates peak activity during early organogenesis rather than during gastrulation or early segmentation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Surface ectoderm / epidermis – strongest signal at 30 somites.  
• Endocrine pancreas – second-strongest peak at 30 somites.  
• Additional, but lower-amplitude accessibility in trunk derivatives: differentiating neurons (incl. enteric and spinal‐cord subsets), presomitic mesoderm/somites, neural crest and muscle.  
These patterns point to a chromatin programme shared by multiple trunk tissues but reaching maximal openness in superficial epithelium and developing pancreas.

3. Likely biological processes / pathways  
Gene set and motif composition converge on an anterior-to-posterior patterning and epithelial maturation programme:  
• A–P positional identity – dense representation of Hox-B/C/D paralogs together with cofactors pbx1/3/4, meis1/2/3, pknox1/2.  
• Epithelial / barrier formation – enrichment of ECM and adhesion genes (cdh2, cdh4, col12a1b, loxhd1a, dst) and FOX / GATA motifs typical of endoderm-derived epithelia and epidermis.  
• Neural and axon-guidance components – ret, gfra4b, npas3, grid2, grin2ab, nrxn3b, robo-like genes, matching accessibility in differentiating neurons and enteric lineages.  
• Late cell-cycle exit / maturation – presence of E2F-, MEF2- and AP-1 (FOS/JUN/BATF) motifs plus cell-cycle regulators (kdm2b, dnmt1, lin28).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment and TF–motif mapping highlight:  
• Trunk Hox paralogs (Hoxb5/6/7/8/9, Hoxc8/9/10, Hoxd9/10/11/12/13) – set positional code.  
• TALE cofactors PBX1/3/4, MEIS1/2/3, PKNOX1/2 – ensure Hox DNA-binding and enhancer selection.  
• Forkhead family (FOXA/C/F/K, FOXD3/5) and SOX factors (SOX5/9/10/12/14) – integrate epithelial and neural inputs.  
• GATA3/4/5/6 – consistent with endocrine-pancreas and epidermal differentiation.  
• AP-1 family (FOSL1/2, JUN, BATF) – chromatin opening during late morphogenesis.  
• E2F1/2/3/4/5/7 – transient activity accompanying final proliferation rounds.

Taken together, cluster 22_15 marks enhancers governed by a Hox–TALE core that orchestrates late trunk organogenesis, driving epidermal maturation, pancreatic endocrine specification and concurrent neuronal/mesodermal differentiation around the 24 hpf (30-somite) stage.
]

## Cluster 22_16

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 22_16 represents an enhancer set that “switches on” as the trunk starts to segment and remains active through terminal differentiation of somite-derived tissues.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at gastrula/0–5-somite stages, rises sharply by 10–20 somites, and is highest at 30 somites.  
   • This timing (≈14–24 hpf) corresponds to the window when presomitic mesoderm (PSM) is rhythmically segmenting and the first fast-muscle fibres and superficial epidermis are maturing.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Presomitic mesoderm → nascent somites (PSM_10-30 som)  
   • Differentiated fast-twitch muscle (fast_muscle_10-30 som)  
   • Somite bulk (somites_10-30 som) and NMPs (posterior progenitors)  
   • Late epidermis (epidermis_20–30 som; sharp spike at 30 som)  
   Together these profiles point to a trunk paraxial-mesoderm/dermomyotome program with a late epidermal component.

3. Likely regulatory programme / biology  
   • Somite segmentation clock and patterning (mespba, her7, wnt3a, fgf24, lf1, dll/Notch targets)  
   • Myotome specification and fast-muscle differentiation (smyhc1, myl1, vgll2a, casz1, mef2-regulated sarcomeric genes)  
   • ECM assembly and myotendinous junction formation (many collagens, fn1a/b, nid1/2, vcanb, thbs2a)  
   • Posterior trunk anterior-posterior patterning (rich set of Hox, Runx, Fox, Sox, Tbx–linked genes)  
   • Superficial epithelium / epidermal maturation (grhl, tfap2, keratin/ECM genes) — explaining the late epidermal peak.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (top enriched motifs & co-expressed genes)  
   • Myogenic/contractile: MEF2 family (mef2a/b/c/d), SRF & TEAD/VGLL2 axis  
   • Segmentation & paraxial identity: T-box factors (Tbx15/18/20), Mespba, Ripply1, Her7 (Notch clock)  
   • Wnt/β-catenin effectors: LEF1 / TCF4 motifs – align with lef1, tcf4 transcripts  
   • Patterning/positional: HOX cluster ( multiple Hox9-13 motifs & genes) and Runx2/3  
   • Forkhead & Sox co-factors: FOXK1/FOXC1, SOX5/6/9 – contribute to dermomyotome and epidermis  
   • AP-1/ATF/CREB (Fos/Jun/ATF3) – marks mechanically responsive muscle enhancers and late epidermal stress-response elements.

In summary, peak-cluster 22_16 demarcates regulatory regions that become accessible as the paraxial mesoderm segments, orchestrating fast-muscle differentiation, trunk patterning and subsequent epidermal maturation, driven primarily by MEF2/TBX/HOX/Wnt-TCF factors with support from Forkhead/Sox and AP-1 families.
]

## Cluster 22_17

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 22_17 marks a set of regulatory elements that “switch hands” during the 10–24 hpf window: they are first used by migrating cranial-neural-crest–/pharyngeal-arch mesenchyme and are later reused by the surface ectoderm as it differentiates into epidermis/periderm.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Very high accessibility at the earliest stage (0-somite, ≈10 hpf) – most conspicuously in the pharyngeal-arches sample (42.5-fold above background).  
   • Accessibility is modest (≈3-4 log-norm units) in most tissues through intermediate stages.  
   • A second, dramatic peak appears at 30 somites (≈24 hpf) in epidermis (86-fold).  
   → Biphasic use: early 0-somite arch patterning, late 30-somite epidermal maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity (top signals)  
   • Early: pharyngeal_arches_0 somites (cranial NCC–derived mesenchyme)  
   • Late: epidermis_30 somites (surface ectoderm/periderm)  
   • Secondary, lower-amplitude accessibility is seen in other ectodermal derivatives (optic cup, telencephalon, hindbrain) but never reaches the two spikes above.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   • Early phase – branchial-arch / craniofacial patterning: extracellular-matrix genes (kera, col12a1a, col5a3b, tnc), signalling modulators (adamtsl3, furinb), integrins (itgb4), guidance & adhesion genes (kirrel, neo1), consistent with NCC condensation and cartilage template formation.  
   • Late phase – epidermal/barrier differentiation: keratin-related kera, junction/adhesion components (itgb4, adam10a), lipid-handling genes (slc, abcg), AP-1/IRF-target genes – typical of periderm and maturing skin.  
   • Functional theme: morphogenesis of craniofacial structures followed by epithelial stratification and barrier acquisition.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Early arch/NCC programme  
   – DLX (dlx2a/5a/6a/4a)  
   – MSX1/2, MEIS/PBX/PKNOX, HOX PG1-3 (hoxa2b, hoxb1a), TBX1, PAX3/7, TFAP2 family, SOX9/10, FOX (foxd3/foxc)  

   Late epidermal programme  
   – ΔNp63 / TP63, GRHL1/2, IRF6/IRF4, KLF5/17/13, CEBP family, AP-1 complex (Fos/Jun/Batf/Jdp2), SREBP, TEAD/VGLL4, RUNX1/3  

   The motif enrichment table shows strong scores for HOX/DLX/MSX/MEIS groups and for bZIP/AP-1, GRHL, IRF, KLF/ZNF and TP63 motifs, matching the two developmental waves.

In sum, cluster 22_17 contains regulatory DNA that is first deployed to pattern cranial neural-crest–derived pharyngeal arches and is later reutilised by the developing epidermis to drive barrier-forming gene expression.
]

## Cluster 23_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 23_0 represents a “house-keeping / proliferation” chromatin program that is opened in almost every lineage but is maximally accessible in fast-dividing, late-somite–stage tissues.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at the 0-somite stage but rises by ~15-20 % toward the 20- and 30-somite samples.  
   • The highest values are consistently seen in the last two time-points (∼22–24 hpf), indicating that the elements in this cluster are most active during early organogenesis when many lineages are still proliferating rapidly.

2. Cell-type specificity (top pseudobulks)  
   Highest accessibility (≥ 700 normalised counts) is observed in:  
   – Heart myocardium (30-som)  
   – Fast / general muscle (30-som)  
   – Somites & tail-bud mesoderm  
   – Neural progenitor–rich compartments (neural telencephalon, hind-/mid-brain)  
   Lower—but still appreciable—accessibility is present in virtually all other lineages; only early optic-cup and some differentiated epithelial cells show relative troughs.  Thus the cluster marks broadly proliferative, rather than lineage-restricted, cells.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Gene set: histone genes (H2A/H4 family), core ribosomal sub-units (RPS17, RPS25), chromatin remodelers (ARID1A/B, BRD4, EZH2), cell-cycle controllers (CCND2a, CDK12/19, WEE1, BTG2, FOXM1, MCM7) and global metabolic regulators (MAZ, HMGA1/2).  
   Functional enrichment therefore points to:  
   • DNA replication, S-phase progression, chromosome organisation  
   • Ribosome biogenesis & global transcription/translation capacity  
   • Generic stress-adaptation / metabolic housekeeping  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and TF–mapping highlight a classic cell-cycle module:  
   • E2F family (E2F1/2/3/4/5/7/8) – gate-keepers of G1/S transition  
   • FOXM1 – late-S/G2 transcriptional amplifier  
   • MYB / MYBL, SP1/SP4 and KLFs – general RNA-pol II promoter factors  
   • ETS (ELK, FLI1, ERG) & NRF/NR2F nuclear receptors – supporting broad transcriptional output  
   Together these factors are well-known to regulate the histone, DNA-replication and ribosome genes that dominate the associated-gene list.

In summary, peak-cluster 23_0 corresponds to ubiquitously used promoter/enhancer elements that are most open in late-somite, highly proliferative tissues, orchestrated by an E2F–FOXM1-centric transcriptional network that drives core cell-cycle and housekeeping gene expression during the transition from somitogenesis to early organ formation.

## Cluster 23_1

[*assistant*:
Biological synopsis of Peak-cluster 23_1  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at the earliest stage we profiled (10 hpf/0-somite; ≈400 norm. counts) and remains remarkably constant.  
• A slight uptick (≈10-15 %) is seen after 20- to 30-somite stages (≈24 hpf), indicating that the regions stay open and may even broaden as cells enter early organogenesis.  
⇒ Conclusion: this is a constitutively open cluster that is active throughout the entire 10- to 24-hpf window, with only modest late amplification.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• All >50 lineage pseudobulks show accessibility values in a narrow range (≈300-510).  
• The highest signals are in highly proliferative or metabolically active tissues—neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP), presomitic/somite mesoderm, hematopoietic-vasculature, epidermis and early muscle.  
• Very few lineages dip far below the mean (notochord/optic cup are the lower end but still >70 % of the maximum).  
⇒ Cluster 23_1 is broadly accessible; it is not lineage-restricted but slightly favours fast-cycling, progenitor-rich compartments.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Gene content (≫700 genes) is heavily enriched for:  
• House-keeping / basal transcription & translation: ribosomal proteins (RPL14, RPS17, EEFs, EIFs), RNA-binding proteins (HNRNPs, IGF2BP3), spliceosome and chromatin remodellers (CHD4/6/7/8, BRD4, CTCF, DNMT3B).  
• Cell-cycle and DNA-replication/repair: CCND1, E2F3, PCNA, TAFs, MCM-interacting factors.  
• Core metabolic & cytoskeletal genes: ACTB1, ACTN4, ATPases, HK1, PGAM1.  
Pathway enrichment therefore points to a “house-keeping / proliferation” module that every embryonic cell needs but is particularly demanded in rapidly dividing progenitors.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif over-representation plus the presence of the cognate TF RNAs highlight a canonical promoter code:  
• Cell-cycle/E2F module – E2F1/2/3/4/5/7 with their dimerisation partner TFDP1; drives S-phase genes.  
• General promoter factors/NF-Y-SP-KLF – NF-Y, YY1, SP2/3, KLF family (KLF5/6/8/9/13) typical of CpG-rich constitutive promoters.  
• Chromatin-associated CpG-island regulators – KDM2B/KDM2A, CXXC1/4/5 motifs (matches strong enrichment of CxxC-binding factors).  
• CREB/ATF and ETS (ELK4, ETS2, FEV, FLI1) motifs – ubiquitous competence factors that boost basal transcription.  
• TEAD-YAP module – TEAD1/3 motifs together with robust yap1 expression; links housekeeping promoters to growth signalling.  
Altogether these TFs form the generic “basal‐proliferation” transcriptional machinery rather than a lineage-restricted patterning network.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 23_1 corresponds to a set of promoter-proximal, CpG-rich regions that stay open in virtually every embryonic cell from gastrulation through early organogenesis.  They underlie expression of core metabolic and cell-cycle genes and are controlled by ubiquitous promoter-binding TFs (E2F, NF-Y/SP/KLF, YY1, CREB/ATF, ETS, TEAD-YAP).  Its slight enrichment in progenitor domains simply reflects the higher transcriptional output of rapidly dividing cells rather than lineage-specific regulation.

## Cluster 23_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 23_2 corresponds to a set of promoter-proximal/early-enhancer regions that mark actively cycling, still-multipotent mesodermal cells and their immediate derivatives.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0–5-somite stages but climbs steadily and reaches its maximum at 20–30 somites (≈ 19–24 hpf).  
   • This rise parallels the burst of somitic growth and the first wave of hemato-vascular specification, indicating the cluster is linked to rapid proliferation rather than to very early gastrulation events.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signal)  
   • Paraxial mesoderm lineage: tail-bud, presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and forming somites.  
   • Mesoderm-derived progenitors: neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), lateral plate/hemangioblast populations.  
   • Moderate in early myocardium and fast skeletal muscle anlagen.  
   • Clearly lower in differentiating neurons, endoderm and epidermis, showing this program is preferentially used by highly proliferative mesodermal cells.

3. Likely regulatory programme / biological processes  
   • Strong enrichment of cell-cycle, DNA-replication and chromatin-remodelling genes (e.g. ccnb1, e2f7, uhrf1, prmt5, kdm families) together with metabolic genes (aclya, fdps, hmgcs1) points to a “core proliferation” module.  
   • Presence of mesoderm/hematovascular patterning factors (tcf7l2, meis/pbx, runx, gata, etv/fli) indicates these regions also prime lineage-specific programmes that will later diversify into muscle, axial mesoderm and blood/endothelium.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene co-expression)  
   • E2F family (E2F1/2/3/4/7/8) – classical drivers of S-phase entry; highest motif Z-scores.  
   • Forkhead factors: FOXM1/FOXK2/FOXO subgroup – integrate proliferation with metabolic state.  
   • HOX–PBX/MEIS axis – regional identity along the antero-posterior axis of the forming somites.  
   • PAX3/7 and TBX (especially TBX6/16/18/20) – specification of paraxial and lateral plate mesoderm.  
   • ETS factors (ETV2/Fli1/Elf) and RUNX/GATA – early hemangioblast / endothelial–blood competence.  
   • MEF2 and SRF motifs appear but with lower scores, consistent with impending myogenic differentiation.

In short, peak-cluster 23_2 defines a ubiquitous “proliferative mesoderm” chromatin programme that is most accessible late in the segmentation period, strongest in rapidly dividing paraxial mesoderm and hemangioblast precursors, and orchestrated by E2F-FOXM1 cell-cycle regulators layered with HOX/PAX/TBX and ETS/GATA factors that pre-pattern emerging muscle and blood lineages.

## Cluster 23_3

[*assistant*:
Biological synopsis for peak-cluster 23_3  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already detectable at gastrulation/0-somites but rises steadily with every 5-somite interval and peaks at 20–30 somites (≈ 19–24 hpf).  
• The late-peak profile (highest signals in 20- & 30-somite samples for floor-plate, notochord, tail-bud, spinal cord, PSM and somites) indicates that these regions are most active during fast trunk elongation and the onset of organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest chromatin opening is seen in –  
• Axial mid-line tissues: floor plate and notochord  
• Posterior growth zone derivatives: tail-bud, neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and forming somites/fast muscle  
• Early neural derivatives: spinal cord & hindbrain neuroepithelium, neural crest, differentiating neurons  
Accessibility is moderate or declining in more anterior / endodermal or mature organs, matching a trunk-posterior bias.

3. Likely regulatory programme  
The correlated genes and motif catalogue point to enhancers that coordinate:  
• Posterior body-axis extension and segmentation (mesp, notch/dla, fgf, wnt/β-catenin, Hox tier 1-10, tbx, msgn/mesogenin)  
• Neural-crest induction & EMT (foxd3, sox10, pax3/7, zic2/3, msx1/3, snai1a/2, zeb1/2)  
• Neural-tube dorsoventral patterning & floor-plate signalling (shh co-receptor boc, ptch2, gli2, hs6st2)  
• RA, FGF and BMP signalling integration (rara/rarg, smad3/6, sfrp5, sulf1)  
• High cell-cycle/epigenetic plasticity (lin28a, myc modulators, kdm6b, tet2/3, jarid2) typical of axial progenitors.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (enriched motifs + expressed genes)  
Principal pioneer / lineage factors  
• Sox family – Sox2/3/5/10/11/14/19 (neuro-ectoderm & neural crest)  
• Fox family – Foxd3, Foxa/c, Foxc1/c2, Foxp1/4 (crest, mesoderm, floor plate)  
• Pax3/7, Pax6/8 (neural plate border & spinal cord)  
• Zic2/3/5, Msx1/3 (dorsal neural plate, crest)  
• Hox A/B/C tiers 1-10 (antero-posterior identity of trunk cells)  
Signal-integration / growth regulators  
• Tcf/Lef (Wnt), Tbx16/6/20 (mesoderm & segmentation), Tead/Yap1 (growth, mechanotransduction), nuclear receptors RAR/RXR/NR2F (RA feedback), Smad3 (TGF-β), E2F/FOXM1 (proliferation).  

Together, peak-cluster 23_3 marks a trunk-posterior, progenitor-rich enhancer set that becomes maximally active during late somitogenesis to co-ordinate axial elongation, segmentation and neural-crest/neural-tube patterning.
]

## Cluster 23_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 23_4 corresponds to a “core proliferation / housekeeping” regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at the earliest stage we profiled (0-somite); it stays broadly elevated through 5–15 somites and begins to taper slightly as development reaches 20–30 somites and cells differentiate.  
   • The modest decline in differentiated‐neuron, epidermal and optic-cup pseudobulks (∼220–235 vs. ∼260–280) contrasts with sustained high levels in progenitor pools, indicating that the cluster is most active during the rapid-division window of early somitogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in the most proliferative compartments:  
   – Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP), tail-bud, presomitic/somite mesoderm, hematopoietic/vasculature precursors and hemangioblasts (peaks up to ~360 at 20 som).  
   – Uniform but slightly lower signal in more differentiated lineages (neurons, epidermis, optic cup, pancreas).  
   In other words, the cluster is ubiquitous but preferentially open in highly mitotic progenitor niches.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Gene set: MKI67, MCM3, CDC45, UBE2C/S, CDCA8, NDC80-complex members, numerous KIFs, ribosomal proteins, translation factors, metabolic enzymes.  
   GO/Pathway implication:  
   • Cell-cycle initiation and progression (G1/S via E2F, G2/M via FOXM1/Nek2/Kif family)  
   • DNA replication, chromosome segregation, spindle organisation  
   • Core biosynthetic and energy‐metabolism processes required for cell growth and division  
   This profile matches a canonical “housekeeping + proliferation” promoter set that every dividing cell needs.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment points to classic cell-cycle and general-promoter regulators:  
   • E2F family (E2F1/2/3/4/5/7/8) + their dimerisation partner TFDP1 – governs G1/S gene activation.  
   • FOXM1 / FOXK / FOXO sub-family – G2/M and proliferation control.  
   • NF-Y (NFYA/NFAYL) and SP/KLF factors – ubiquitous CCAAT and GC-box promoter binders.  
   • MYB/MYBL and RUNX – additional mitotic gene regulators.  
   • YY1/CTCF – chromatin organiser motifs typical of broad promoters.  

   Together these TFs constitute the canonical programme that keeps promoters of replication, ribosome-biogenesis and metabolic genes accessible and transcriptionally competent in dividing embryonic cells.

Summary: Peak-cluster 23_4 marks promoter/enhancer regions of essential proliferation and housekeeping genes. It is open in virtually all tissues but peaks in rapidly cycling progenitors early in somitogenesis, driven chiefly by E2F/FOX/KLF-type transcription factors that orchestrate the embryonic cell-cycle machinery.

## Cluster 24_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24_0 captures an early, heart-specific burst of chromatin accessibility.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Maximum signal at the 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf): heart_myocardium_0somites = 44.6 (≈20-fold above the baseline 2–3 seen elsewhere).  
   • Accessibility collapses by 5 somites and stays at low/background levels thereafter, indicating a short-lived opening event at the onset of heart-field specification.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • The spike is confined to “heart_myocardium” pseudobulk; no other tissue shows a comparable increase.  
   • Mild/background accessibility (2–3) in other mesodermal or neural samples likely reflects technical noise or low-level sharing of generic regulatory elements.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Gene set is enriched for early cardiogenic/mesodermal genes and ECM remodelers: tbx5a/b, tbx15/18/20, mef2 (aa/ab/ca/cb), myh7ba, myl1, actc1c, kdr, pdgfra, tnc, numerous collagens/laminins, lox/loxl, tenascin-C, etc.  
   • Functional theme: specification of cardiac mesoderm, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of the bilateral heart fields, and deposition/remodelling of the cardiac extracellular matrix that shapes the nascent heart tube.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene list)  
   • GATA family (gata4/5/6) – classic activators of cardiac lineage.  
   • TBX factors (Tbx5/20/15/18) – patterning of atrial/ventricular identity and looping.  
   • NKX homeobox (Nkx2.5/2.7) – early heart-field specification.  
   • MEF2 family – transition to contractile cardiomyocyte programme.  
   • SRF/TEAD & CEBP/NRF motifs appear secondarily, consistent with cytoskeletal/ECM gene activation.  

In summary, peak-cluster 24_0 marks a transient, heart-field-specific regulatory module that is opened immediately after gastrulation to launch the core cardiogenic transcriptional network and extracellular-matrix programme required for early heart-tube formation.
]

## Cluster 24_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24_1 captures a very sharp, late-stage burst of chromatin opening that is virtually confined to the hatching-gland lineage.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is flat-to-moderate (log10-norm ≈ 9) at all stages until 24 hpf (≈ 30-somite).  
   • At 30-somite stage the signal in hatching-gland cells jumps five-fold (47.0), indicating a switch-like activation that coincides with functional maturation of this secretory organ immediately before larval hatching.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest accessibility: hatching gland (30 som).  
   • Secondary but much lower signal (≈ 9–10) is broadly detectable in other endodermal derivatives (endoderm progenitors, endocrine pancreas) and some neural/neural-crest populations, suggesting these peaks are generally accessible but only maximally engaged in the mature hatching gland.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Associated-gene catalogue is enriched for endoderm / secretory-gland programmes: Foxa, Gata, Sox32/17, Nkx2-3/4 targets, secretory vesicle and ECM-remodelling genes (e.g. vcana, furina/furinb, mmp-related family members, sparc).  
   • The late burst matches the time when hatching-gland cells begin massive production and exocytosis of choriolytic enzymes that dissolve the chorion.  
   • Pathways therefore point to endoderm-specification plus terminal differentiation of an exocrine-like, protease-secreting cell type.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & mapping)  
   • Endoderm pioneers: FoxA1/2/3, FoxF1/2, FoxD3/FoxI — strong forkhead motif set.  
   • GATA family (Gata4/5/6) – required for hatching-gland specification and epithelial secretory identity.  
   • SOX32/17/19 – early endodermal competence, still enriched.  
   • NKX2 (Nkx2-3/4/5) – characteristic of pharyngeal endoderm/hatching-gland.  
   • One-cut / Pbx / Meis cofactors – typical of rostral endoderm and secretory tissue maturation.  
   • Minor but significant MEF2/TBX and HSF motifs suggest coupling to terminal secretory function and stress-responsive protein-folding load.

In sum, peak-cluster 24_1 marks the transcriptional burst that finalises hatching-gland differentiation at ~24 hpf, driven by a Forkhead-GATA-SOX-NKX core network that activates genes needed for enzyme secretion and chorion digestion.
]

## Cluster 24_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24_2 corresponds to a late-segmentation/early-organogenesis vascular-lateral-plate programme that later becomes highly accessible in the differentiating endocrine pancreas.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at gastrulation/early segmentation (0–10 somites) but rises sharply from 15 somites onward and reaches a maximum at 24 hpf (30-somite stage).  
   • The steepest increase is seen between 20 → 30 somites, indicating that the cis-regulatory elements in this cluster are engaged during tissue morphogenesis rather than during initial lineage specification.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest pseudobulk accessibility)  
   • Lateral plate mesoderm (LPM): 12–21 a.u. across 0–20 somites – first cell type to open this cluster.  
   • Haemangioblast / haemato-vascular progenitors: 7.9 → 11.5 a.u.; and “haematopoietic-vasculature” 10–21 a.u. – consistent with nascent endothelium.  
   • Endocrine pancreas: explodes to 45.5 a.u. at 30 somites (unique spike) – suggests reuse of the same regulatory cassette in pancreatic islet precursors.  
   • Secondary but significant accessibility in endoderm and early heart myocardium (4–5 a.u.).

3. Likely biological processes regulated  
   • Vasculogenesis / angiogenic sprouting (genes: kdr, vegfc, pdgfrb, fli1a, epor, fa2h, adam12/19/ts9 for ECM remodelling).  
   • LPM-derived mesenchymal signalling and migration (pald1, tgfbr2a, lta4h, rgs7a, suox).  
   • Late re-deployment in endocrine-pancreatic epithelium, implying coordination of vascular invasion and endocrine differentiation.  
   • Enrichment of genes involved in cytoskeletal dynamics (cnn3a, vimr2, hpca) and membrane trafficking (rab3aa, rab5aa, tbc1d15) fits with active cell rearrangements during vessel/outflow tract formation and islet clustering.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene presence)  
   • ETS family (Fli1, Erg, Etv2/Etv4/Etv5) – canonical endothelial/haemangioblast activators; strongest motif z-scores for ETS sites.  
   • GATA factors (Gata2/3/6, Tal1 co-factor) – required for haemato-vascular specification and endocrine lineage priming.  
   • Forkhead (FoxC/FoxF/FoxG, FoxO/K) – patterning of LPM and endothelial sprouting; multiple FOX motifs highly enriched.  
   • SOXF group (Sox7/17/18) – endothelial identity; Sox motifs abundant.  
   • KLF2/6/9 & E2F cluster – proliferation and shear-stress response of emerging endothelium.  
   • HOX / PBX – positional cues within LPM; HOX-PBX motifs over-represented.  
   • In the pancreatic phase, pancreas-specific TF motifs (Pax6, Neurod/Atoh, Onecut) appear among the enriched indirect list, explaining the late endocrine-pancreas spike.

Together, peak-cluster 24_2 marks a regulatory module that is first opened in lateral-plate/haemangioblast derivatives to drive vascular and mesenchymal programmes and is later re-used in endocrine-pancreatic cells during islet organisation, under the combined control of ETS, GATA, FOX, SOXF and KLF/HOX transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 24_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24_3 represents a late-stage, tissue-specific burst of regulatory activity that accompanies the functional maturation of somite-derived tissues and the newly forming endocrine pancreas.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest and fairly uniform from 0- to 20-somite stages (10–20 hpf).  
   • A sharp spike appears at the 30-somite/24 hpf sample, most conspicuously in presomitic mesoderm (PSM_30 somites ≈ 27-fold above background) and in endocrine-pancreatic progenitors (≈ 44-fold).  
   → Cluster 24_3 therefore marks a late, “organogenesis-onset” regulatory wave.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest values:  
   • Endocrine pancreas (β/δ progenitors) at 30 s.  
   • Posterior PSM / tail-bud mesoderm at 30 s.  
   Secondary but consistent accessibility (1.5-2.5-fold) is seen in differentiating neurons, floor-plate, heart myocardium and fast muscle, suggesting the elements are reused in several excitable/secretory lineages but peak in the two sites above.

3. Likely biological programme  
   Associated genes are heavily enriched for:  
   • Synaptic transmission & Ca²⁺ handling (RYR2, UNC13B, CACNA1ab, NTRK3b, GRIN2d, GABBR1).  
   • Cell-adhesion / axon-guidance (CNTNAP2a/3, NCAM2, CDH4, COL4/5, TENM2, SHANK3a).  
   • Muscle/contractile & ECM remodelling (MYBPC3, TBC1D1, MMP13a, FBLN5).  
   • Endocrine/secretory signalling (PLCB1, PTGIS, TG).  
   Together these point to a programme that equips maturing neurons, myofibres and endocrine cells with excitability, vesicle-release and adhesion machinery—exactly the functions that become critical at 24 hpf when motility begins and pancreatic hormone-secreting cells appear.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment)  
   • bHLH neurogenic factors: NeuroD1/4/6, Atoh1/7, Olig2 – drive neuronal/endocrine differentiation.  
   • Myogenic regulators: MyoD, Myf5/6, MEF2 (MEF2A/B/C/D) – active in late PSM and nascent muscle.  
   • Homeobox patterning network: Hox-Pbx-Meis, Lhx, Dlx, Pax7/3 – confers axial and lineage identity.  
   • Sox / Fox family pioneer factors (SOX5/10/12/21, FOXD3/FORKHEAD cluster) – open chromatin and maintain multipotency.  
   • Nuclear-receptor cassette (RAR/RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR, PPAR) – links retinoid & metabolic cues to this maturation module.  
   • Circadian/clock BHLH factors (CLOCK, BHLHE40/41) hint at first establishment of rhythmic transcription in these cells.

In summary, peak-cluster 24_3 encodes the late-embryonic regulatory programme that endows posterior somite mesoderm and nascent endocrine-pancreatic cells—plus several neuron and muscle derivatives—with the molecular toolkit for excitability, secretion and tissue-specific connectivity, orchestrated by neurogenic bHLH, myogenic MEF2/MyoD, and Hox-Fox-Sox patterning factors.
]

## Cluster 24_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24_4 marks a secretory/epithelial gene-regulatory module that turns on late in somitogenesis and is shared by the hatching-gland, endocrine-pancreas and (to a lesser extent) notochord/endoderm.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is moderate at 0–5 somites (~10–12 hpf) and rises steadily thereafter.  
   • It reaches a clear maximum between 20–30 somites (≈18–24 hpf), with the highest signal at 30-somites.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest mean accessibility)  
   1. Hatching-gland cells  19 → 54 a.u. (0 → 30 som)  
   2. Endocrine-pancreas   8 – 10 a.u. throughout somitogenesis  
   3. Notochord       ~7–8 a.u. (stable)  
   4. Early gut/endoderm   ~5–8 a.u. (gradually increases)  
   Most other tissues remain near baseline (~2–3 a.u.).

3. Inferred biological programme  
   Associated gene set is enriched for:  
   • Secretory-vesicle and exocytosis machinery (CADPS, SV2C, SYTL2/5, RAB26, RIN2, FURIN).  
   • Ion and metabolite transporters important for fluid/protein secretion (SLC4A5, SLC45A4, CA5A/CA8, SLC8A1, ITPR3).  
   • Lipid / energy metabolism (PPARGC1B, LDHA, ACER3, CPT1C).  
   • ECM/remodelling proteins (FBLN2, COL27A1B, MMP30) required for chorion digestion or gland morphogenesis.  
   Together these features point to a secretory epithelial differentiation module used by:  
   • Hatching-gland cells that produce chorionase enzymes;  
   • Endocrine-pancreatic precursors (islet lineage);  
   • Mid-axial endoderm derivatives (notochord sheath secretion).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs enriched in the cluster)  
   • Forkhead / Fox family (FoxA1/2/3, FoxC, FoxD, FoxF) – pioneer factors for endodermal/hatching-gland epithelium.  
   • Hox / Nkx / Barx / Dlx homeobox factors (Hoxb5, Hoxc/d9-13, Nkx2-1/4/5, Barx1, Dlx2/4/5) – axial patterning and gland specification.  
   • Pdx1, Pbx/Meis and Pax6/7 – canonical regulators of endocrine-pancreas and secretory cell identity.  
   • Gata4/5/6 and Sox9/10 – promote epithelial maturation and secretion.  
   • Kdm2ba motif suggests a chromatin-remodelling component that may license late activation of this programme.

Summary: peak-cluster 24_4 captures a late-somitogenesis secretory–epithelial enhancer set, maximally active in hatching-gland cells and endocrine pancreas, regulated by Fox-, Hox/Nkx-homeobox, Gata/Sox and Pdx1/Pbx factors.
]

## Cluster 24_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24_5 marks an early cardiac/pharyngeal-mesoderm enhancer module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility spikes at the very first sampled stage (0-somite, ≈10 hpf) and is already markedly lower by 5-somites and almost baseline afterwards.  
   • Thus the cluster is transiently active during the specification window when the cardiac crescent and anterior (cardiopharyngeal) mesoderm are being patterned.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Heart myocardium 0-somites: extraordinarily high signal (≈45-fold above background).  
   • Pharyngeal-arches 5-somites: second-highest signal (≈29-fold).  
   • All other cell types/time-points hover around the dataset’s baseline (~2–3), indicating minimal activity outside the early cardiopharyngeal field.

3. Likely regulatory programme / biological processes  
   • Initiation of cardiac muscle fate and concomitant patterning of the pharyngeal (second-heart-field) mesoderm.  
   • Genes in the peak set include angiogenic factors (angpt1/2a), ECM / migration genes (hspg2, itga3/4, itgb3, dst), RA/HOX patterning genes and many adhesion / signalling components—typical of cells preparing for cardiac looping and cranio-facial arch formation.  
   • Enriched motif families (NKX, TBX, GATA, MEF2, HOX/PBX, RA-receptor nuclear receptors) fit the gene ontology of cardiac induction and anterior lateral-plate mesoderm patterning.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   • Core cardiac TFs: NKX2-5/2-3/2-4, TBX5/TBX20, GATA4/5/6, MEF2A/C/D.  
   • Second-heart-field / pharyngeal TFs: TBX1, ISL1, HAND2, HOXA/B cluster plus PBX/MEIS cofactors.  
   • RA-dependent nuclear receptors (RARA/RARG, RXRs) and PBX/HOX motifs point to retinoic-acid patterning of the cardiopharyngeal mesoderm.  
   • Supporting regulators: E2F/FOXM1 (cell-cycle burst of proliferating heart progenitors) and SOX/Forkhead factors that cooperate during early mesendoderm patterning.

In sum, cluster 24_5 represents a set of cis-regulatory elements that open briefly and almost exclusively in nascent cardiopharyngeal mesoderm, orchestrated by the canonical early-heart TF cadre to launch heart-field and pharyngeal-arch development.
]

## Cluster 24_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24_6 marks a set of regulatory regions that switch on during mid-somitogenesis and are almost exclusively used by surface ectoderm / epidermal derivatives, with a late boost in the nascent endocrine pancreas.  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Already detectable at the 0-somite stage but climbs sharply by 5–10 somites.  
• Highest accessibility between 10 and 20 somites (14-20 hpf) and remains high at 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signals:  
• Epidermis – very strong at every time-point (log-accessibility 5.8 → 9.9).  
• A secondary spike in endocrine-pancreatic cells at 30 somites (reflecting emergence of hormone-secreting β/α cells).  
Modest but above background in superficial ectoderm-derived neurons and cranial neural crest; low in mesodermal populations.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Associated genes are typical of epithelial / secretory differentiation:  
• Structural / barrier: krt17, oclna, nectin4a, cadm1a, cdh22, lrp2a, lrp1bb, dcn, pxdn.  
• Vesicle trafficking & Ca2+-dependent exocytosis: unc13b(a), syt1a, cadps2, cacna1da, myo5aa, pi4kaa, pitpnc1b, ptgs1.  
• Cell signalling & polarity: nrg1, prkcaa, lpar2b, ndst2a, epas1a, apc/bcl9 (β-catenin module).  
Together they point to:  
• Formation/maturation of the epidermal barrier.  
• Assembly of the secretory machinery later reused by endocrine-pancreatic cells.  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
• Epidermal fate regulators: TP63 (motif set TFCP2/TPRG1), GRHL1/2, TFAP2 family.  
• SOX cluster (SOX5/9/10/21) – early ectodermal competence and keratin gene activation.  
• FOX factors (FOXA/F, FOXK, FOXC) – epithelial polarity and secretory vesicle genes.  
• RFX1/4 – ciliogenesis / junctional gene control in surface ectoderm.  
• KLF & Grainy-head motifs – reinforce barrier/keratin programme.  
• Nuclear receptors NR2F2 (COUP-TFII) & RORβ – consistent with Rorb, Nr2f2 target genes and the later endocrine signal.  
• AP-1 (FOS/JUN) and TEAD/TA co-motifs appear as secondary, supporting epithelial proliferation.  

In summary, peak-cluster 24_6 represents the epidermal/envelope gene-regulatory module that is first deployed in surface ectoderm during somitogenesis and is later reutilised by differentiating endocrine-pancreatic cells as they acquire a robust secretory apparatus.
]

## Cluster 24_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24_7 marks a pan-neuronal regulatory program that progressively turns on as the nervous system differentiates.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at 10 hpf (0-somite) but rises steadily through segmentation and peaks at 24 hpf (30-somite).  
   • Highest values are found at late-somite stages (20–30 somites), consistent with the onset of neurogenesis and early synaptogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Differentiating neurons (all regions)  
   • Brain territories – hindbrain, midbrain-hindbrain boundary, telencephalon, optic cup, spinal cord / neural posterior  
   • Neural crest derivatives (early melanocytes, cranial ganglia)  
   *Note*: A single outlier in “heart_myocardium_0-somite” (44.4) is likely a library-size artefact; heart samples at later stages do not show enrichment.

3. Biological processes represented  
   Gene content is dominated by neuronal and synaptic genes (ion-channel subunits GRIK2/3, GRIN2B, GABRB2; scaffold genes SHANK1/2, PSD components; axon-guidance receptors ROBOs, UNC5; adhesion molecules NRXN1/2, CNTN3-5, L1-family). Together with enrichment of neurotransmitter-receptor, cytoskeleton and vesicle-traffic genes, the cluster corresponds to:  
   • Specification of post-mitotic neurons and region-specific identity (forebrain/ hindbrain patterning)  
   • Axon outgrowth and path-finding  
   • Assembly of excitatory and inhibitory synapses  
   • Early neuronal activity and calcium handling

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif and factor lists converge on classical neuronal patterning and proneural TFs:  
   • Sox family: Sox1/2/3 (neural stem cell maintenance), Sox11/4/5/19 (neuronal differentiation)  
   • Homeobox patterning TFs: Pax6/7, Irx1–7, Lhx1/2/9, Dlx, Barhl, Gbx, En, Otx, Hox clusters – providing AP and dorsoventral positional codes.  
   • Proneural bHLH factors: NeuroD1/4/6, Neurog3, Atoh1/7, Olig2 – driving cell-cycle exit and neuronal fate.  
   • MEF2 family – linked to activity-dependent maturation of neurons.  
   • Forkhead/FOX factors (FoxG1, FoxP, FoxD/F) – cortical and hindbrain identity, axon guidance.  
   • Nuclear receptors RORα/β/γ, COUP-TF (Nr2f) – late neuronal maturation and circadian/synaptic genes.  
   • E-box/TCF factors (TCF7/LEF1) and E2F – coupling Wnt and cell-cycle exit with neurogenesis.

Together, peak-cluster 24_7 defines enhancer/promoter regions that scaffold the transcriptional cascade transitioning neuro-epithelial progenitors to regionally specified, synapse-forming neurons during the 10–24 hpf window of zebrafish development.

## Cluster 24_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24_8 corresponds to a late-gastrula/early-organogenesis “neuro-ectodermal secretory” programme that is maximally open in the hatching-gland epithelium and in the nascent retina/optic-cup, and is more modestly accessible in many differentiating neuronal populations.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already detectable at the 0- to 10-somite stages (~10–14 hpf; values ~1.7–1.9).  
• It rises at 15–20 somites and reaches a sharp peak at late stages:  
  – optic_cup 20 som (23.3)  
  – hatching_gland 30 som (44.3)  
Hence the cluster is most active during 18–24 hpf (20–30-somite), i.e. the transition to early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest chromatin accessibility is seen in:  
• Hatching-gland cells (ventral yolk-syncytial ectoderm that secretes proteases for chorion rupture).  
• Optic-cup / early retinal epithelium.  
Secondary accessibility (2–2.5) is present in differentiating central- and peripheral-neurons, neural-crest derivatives, hindbrain/midbrain neuroepithelium and telencephalon, but not in mesendodermal or muscle lineages.

3. Underlying regulatory programme / biology  
Gene set points to a secretory, neuro-sensory epithelial profile:  
• Retina / photoreceptor differentiation: rcvrn2, syngap1b, gria1a/2a, grid2, nrxn1a, cadm2a, pou6f2, otx-related genes.  
• Hatching-gland markers & extracellular-matrix remodelling: bmp7b, dkk1b, mmp28, muc13a, ANPEP, DAB2.  
• Axon guidance / synaptogenesis: cntnap2a/5b, sema5a, git2b, rasgrf1/2, rims1b.  
• Secretory‐pathway / lipid-metabolism genes (acss2l, fasn, pemt, atp8b2) consistent with high vesicular output.  
Together these peaks likely control late patterning of anterior neuro-ectoderm (eye field, forebrain) and maturation of the specialised hatching-gland epithelium.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
Motif enrichment and TF–gene presence converge on:  
• Sox family: Sox2/3/14/19, Sox4/11 (neuro-ectoderm competence, retinal progenitors).  
• Fox family: Foxg1, Foxd3/Foxd5, Foxi1/2/3, Foxa1/2 (ventral forebrain, hatching-gland, secretory epithelia).  
• Hox / Pbx / Meis and Dlx/Barhl/Lhx groups (anterior–posterior neural patterning, retinal interneurons).  
• CREB/ATF & BATF/JDP2 bZIP factors (high secretory/ER-stress load).  
• KLF/Sp and E2F motifs (proliferative neuroepithelium just before terminal differentiation).  

In summary, cluster 24_8 demarcates cis-regulatory regions that turn on predominantly in the 18–24 hpf optic-cup and hatching-gland epithelia, coordinated by Sox-Fox-Hox/Dlx TF suites, to drive neuronal/retinal differentiation genes together with genes required for protease-rich secretion necessary for embryo hatching.
]

## Cluster 24_9

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 24_9 captures a late-embryonic “neuro-endocrine differentiation” program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is moderate at 0–10-somite stages, rises at 15–20 somites and reaches a marked peak at 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • The ∼14-fold jump in endocrine_pancreas from 5 som to 30 som (3.9 → 49.5) and the continuous climb in differentiating / mature neuron populations (e.g. hindbrain 6.9 → 14.4) indicate activation during early organogenesis as cells terminally differentiate.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Endocrine pancreas (especially 30-som stage)  
   • CNS neuronal lineages – hindbrain, spinal cord, telencephalon, optic cup, midbrain-hindbrain boundary, floor plate, generic “differentiating-neurons/neurons”.  
   • Neuro-ectoderm–derived peripheral neurons (enteric, neural crest) show secondary enrichment.  
   • Other germ-layer derivatives (somites, muscle, heart) display only modest signals.

3. Likely biological processes regulated  
   Gene set is heavily enriched for:  
   • Synapse/axon specification and neurotransmission (GRIK2, GRIA3, NRXN1/3, NLGN3, TENM2/4, DCC, CNTFR, PSD genes, Ca2+/K+ channel subunits).  
   • Cell-adhesion and axon guidance (CDH4/7/13, PTPRZ1, UNC5A, PLXNA/B, SEMA3F, TNC).  
   • Neuroendocrine vesicle and metabolic genes shared with pancreatic β–cells (SLC2A2/GLUT2, ITPRN2, ANGPT1, PDGF-A, FURIN, WNT7B/11).  
   Overall, the cluster appears to control the final maturation of electrically excitable/neurosecretory cells – central neurons and hormone-secreting endocrine pancreas – equipping them with synaptic adhesion, ion-channel and secretory machinery.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched in this cluster)  
   • RFX family (Rfx2/3/4/6) – classic activators of ciliogenesis and β-cell/neuron secretory genes.  
   • PAX6 / PAX2/3/7 – master regulators of both neural patterning and pancreatic endocrine fate.  
   • NEUROD / bHLH proneural factors (Neurod1/4/6, Atoh1/7, Olig2) – drive neuronal and endocrine differentiation.  
   • Homeobox LIM/ISL/LHX, MEIS/PBX and multiple HOX motifs – consistent with region-specific neuronal maturation.  
   • SOX4/11/21 and FOX (Foxa2, Foxp1/4, Foxg1) families – maintain neural competence and endocrine identity.  
   • NFAT/CREB/ATF and MEF2 motifs – support activity-dependent and calcium-responsive transcription during synaptic integration.

Together, peak cluster 24_9 marks chromatin regions that open late in development in CNS neurons and endocrine pancreatic cells, under the control of RFX-, PAX6-, NEUROD- and HOX/LIM-type factors, to orchestrate the final acquisition of neuro-secretory and synaptic functions.
]

## Cluster 24_10

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24_10 marks the cis-regulatory program that switches on as the endocrine pancreas is born.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is flat-to-low (~5–6 units) in all lineages until late somitogenesis, but jumps >7-fold at 30-somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • The sharp rise at 20–30 somites indicates activation during the transition from pancreatic progenitor to hormone-expressing endocrine cells.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • By far the highest signal is in “endocrine_pancreas_30somites” (45.4; next highest values are ~6), with modest enrichment in earlier endocrine-pancreas pseudobulks and negligible enrichment elsewhere.  
   • Minor secondary accessibility in neighbouring endodermal derivatives (gut tube) and in differentiating muscle is within background dispersion.

3. Biological processes regulated  
   Gene and motif content points to endocrine-islet differentiation and early functional maturation:  
   • β/α-cell lineage determinants (pdx1, pcsk2, neurod1/4/6, pax6, rfx6, isl1/2, gfi1, tal1/2).  
   • Pancreatic/exocrine epithelial programmes (gata4/6, foxa1/2, hnf1a/b, onecut1/2/3).  
   • Chromatin remodelers (meis/pbx, e2f family) that drive rapid cell-cycle exit and endocrine commitment.  
   • Genes for hormone processing, secretory vesicle and glucose/ion transport (slc2a, pcsk2, sgms1, abcc8/9 etc.)—hallmarks of nascent islet activity.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + expressed factors)  
   • PDX1 – core pancreatic homeobox regulator found in associated-gene list.  
   • RFX family (RFX6/3/2) – strongly enriched motifs (#58) and required for islet specification.  
   • NEUROD/NEUROG (BHLH) – motifs in BHLH cluster (#15/#42); drive endocrine differentiation downstream of NGN3.  
   • GATA4/6 and FOXA1/2 – pioneer factors opening pancreatic chromatin.  
   • MEIS/PBX/PKNOX cooperative homeodomain factors – motif clusters (#22/28) that partner with PDX1.  
   • MAFA/MAFB and MAFG/K – large-Maf motifs (#80/#94) accompanying late β-/α-cell maturation.  
   • Pax6/ Pax7 – enriched homeobox group (#23/#54) important for α- and β-cell identity.

In sum, cluster 24_10 represents a late-acting, endocrine-pancreas-specific enhancer set that comes online around 24 hpf to drive islet-cell gene expression, controlled by the canonical PDX1-RFX-NEUROD-GATA/FOXA transcriptional network.
]

## Cluster 24_11

[*assistant*:
Peak‐cluster 24_11 captures an early “excitable / neuro-secretory” chromatin program that turns on at the end of gastrulation and is gradually trimmed back as tissues specialize.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility surges at the 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf) and remains high through 5–10 somites, then progressively declines in most lineages by 20–30 somites.  
   • The single most pronounced spike is in heart-myocardium at 0 somites (≈45-fold above background), indicating an early, transient use of this program before definitive cardiac-specific enhancers take over.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Early heart progenitors / nascent cardiomyocytes (heart_myocardium 0 somites).  
   • Differentiating neurons across CNS and PNS (hind-/mid-/spinal cord, neural crest, enteric neurons).  
   • Secretory derivatives that share an excitable phenotype – endocrine pancreas, hatching-gland cells.  
   • Many mesodermal and endodermal populations show only basal (~0.6–1) or no signal by 30 somites, underlining the early and lineage-restricted nature of the cluster.

3. Biological processes suggested by the associated gene set  
   Genes overlapping or co-expressed with the peaks are heavily enriched for:  
   • Synaptic machinery and neurotransmission (SNAP25a, SLC18A1, GRIN/GRIK family, RIMBP2, UNC5C, LRRTM4).  
   • Ca2+-handling / excitability (RYR2, ATP2B2, CACNA1A/B, KCNN/KCNQ channels).  
   • Cell-adhesion/axon-guidance (TENM2, NPAS3, PCDH, LRR-containing genes).  
   • Secretory/endocrine and cardiomyocyte early markers (ABCC8-like, FGF/ERBB, FN1b).  
   Altogether this points to a program that equips newly specified excitable cells (neurons, endocrine, early muscle/heart) with the core molecular toolkit for calcium-dependent secretion and electrical activity.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs with highest enrichment and mapping)  
   • SOX family (Sox2/3/5/10/21) – neuro-ectoderm competence and early neuron specification.  
   • FOX family (Foxg1, Foxp1/2/4, Foxd3) – regional neural identity and neuro-endocrine programs.  
   • PBX/HOX & DLX/LHX homeodomain factors – anterior-posterior and regional neural patterning; also operative in early heart.  
   • MEF2 (M00152) – activity-responsive enhancer activation in neurons and cardiomyocytes.  
   • AP-1 (FOS/JUN; M00154) – rapid activity-dependent chromatin opening.  
   • E2F (M00137) – aligns with the burst of proliferation just before differentiation.  
   • ROR / NR2F / RAR nuclear receptors – link to metabolic and circadian control of excitability.  
   These motif signatures, together with the temporal pattern, support a transient, activity-priming enhancer set deployed as excitable cell types first appear.

In summary, peak-cluster 24_11 represents an early, SOX/FOX/HOX-controlled enhancer module that primes nascent neurons, endocrine cells and the emerging myocardium for excitability and secretory function, peaking around the 0–10-somite window and tapering as lineage-specific programs take precedence.
]

## Cluster 24_12

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24_12 corresponds to a broad but developmentally-timed neuronal chromatin programme that switches on during mid-somite stages and stays high through early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest at gastrula / 0-somite (∼1.4–1.6 logCPM) but rises steadily, reaching its maximum at 20–30 somites (2–2.5 logCPM in most neural compartments).  
• The gradual increase matches the onset of neurogenesis (12–24 hpf) when post-mitotic neurons extend axons and start forming synapses.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signals are in neural derivatives:  
• Differentiating neurons (all AP levels)  
• Hindbrain, telencephalon, MHB, optic cup  
• Neural floor-plate / spinal cord  
A secondary peak is seen in neural-crest–derived lineages (enteric & peripheral neurons) and, to a lesser extent, in heart myocardium and fast muscle (likely reflecting shared excitable-cell enhancers). Epithelial, endodermal and mesodermal pools remain basal.

3. Inferred regulatory/biological processes  
Gene set enrichment points to late neuronal maturation:  
• Axon guidance & fasciculation – NRXN2/3, TAGAP, UNC5C, SDK2, CNTN / CNTNAP genes  
• Synaptic vesicle release & calcium handling – SNAP25B, RIMS2, CACNA2D3, KCNT1, SCN1LA, RYR1B  
• Cytoskeleton / growth-cone dynamics – FLNB, BIN1, MYO5A, CARMIL3, FIG4  
• Neural metabolic & signalling modulators – NPAS3, QKI, POU6F2, ZBTB20, ZEB2  
Thus 24_12 marks enhancers/promoters that become accessible when differentiating neurons start wiring the nervous system.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs and gene correlations)  
Highly enriched motifs and co-expressed TFs implicate:  
• SOX family (SOX2/3/4/11/14/21) – maintaining neurogenic competence and driving neurite outgrowth.  
• PAX6 / PAX3/7 – regional neural identity & axon guidance.  
• LHX/LBX, DLX, BARHL, TLX – terminal differentiation of hindbrain, spinal and retinal neurons.  
• FOX (FOXP1/2/4, FOXG1, FOXC/F) – neuronal subtype specification and cortical‐like programmes.  
• MEF2 (MEF2C/CA/CB) – activity-dependent synapse maturation.  
• HOX cluster factors – rostro-caudal patterning of spinal/hindbrain neurons.  
Secondary regulators: CREB/ATF, NR4A, RFX and NFAT, fitting activity-regulated genes during circuit formation.

In summary, peak-cluster 24_12 represents late-somite, neuron-specific cis-elements that orchestrate axonal growth and synaptogenesis under the combined control of SOX, PAX, LHX/DLX/HOX and MEF2 transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 24_13

[*assistant*:
Cluster 24_13 – concise interpretation

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already detectable at gastrulation/0-5-somite stages (10–12 hpf) but rises steeply after 10 somites (≈14 hpf) and peaks between 15–30 somites (18–24 hpf).  
• The pattern (flat baseline ≈2–3, then pronounced jump to 4–17 in neural lineages and to > 40 in the 30-somite hatching-gland sample) indicates activation during the transition from neuro-epithelial progenitors to post-mitotic neurons in early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Differentiating neurons (brain, spinal cord) – strongest, progressively rising to 17.4 at 30 somites.  
• Enteric neurons and floor-plate neurons – similarly high (8–16).  
• Posterior presomitic mesoderm/PSM shows a moderate early signal that fades, consistent with neuro-mesodermal progenitors contributing to the neural tube.  
• A single very high value in “hatching-gland_30 somites” is likely an outlier or reflects small-library normalisation; it is not supported by the neuronal gene/motif signature.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Gene set is enriched for:  
• Axon guidance / neurite outgrowth – UNC5C, ROBO2, PLXNA1, SEMA4F, NXPH1, NTNG2, TENM2.  
• Synaptogenesis and neurotransmission – RIMS1/2, LRRTM4, GRIA3, GRIK2, CACNA1 family, DRD2, OPRD1, SLC24A3.  
• Neuronal cell-adhesion and dendritic patterning – CDH4, CDH13, PCDH17, CNTNAP5, GALNTL6, FOXP1-targets.  
• Activity-dependent or late-maturation factors – MEF2, NPAS3, NR4A, RUNX1.  
Together these point to a chromatin module that becomes accessible when neurons exit the cell cycle, extend axons and assemble functional glutamatergic/GABAergic synapses.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (top enriched motif families)  
• SOX (SOX11/5/19/21) – neurogenesis and neuronal identity.  
• FOXP/FOX family (FOXP1/2/4, FOXG1, FOXD3) – cortical/forebrain and hindbrain neuron maturation, axon pathfinding.  
• MEF2 (MEF2A/B/C/D) – activity-dependent synapse maturation.  
• RFX & NFAT – ciliogenesis / calcium-responsive programmes linked to neuronal signalling.  
• HOX / PBX / MEIS – anterior–posterior positional identity of emerging neurons.  
• KDM2B/CXXC motif (direct hit) – suggests epigenetic remodelling of these loci during terminal differentiation.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 24_13 marks a late-neuronal differentiation chromatin programme that switches on after ≈14 hpf, is strongest in newly born central and enteric neurons, and orchestrates axon guidance, synaptogenesis and activity-dependent maturation under the control of SOX, FOXP, MEF2, RFX and HOX transcription-factor networks.
]

## Cluster 24_14

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24_14 corresponds to a cohort of regulatory regions that respond to early Retinoic-acid (RA) signalling and are redeployed during eye-field / retinal neuro-epithelium formation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Earliest and strongest opening at 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf) – high in heart-myocardial progenitors (accessibility ≈ 44 a.u.).  
   • A second pronounced peak at 15 somites (≈18-19 hpf) – very high in optic-cup cells (≈ 46 a.u.).  
   • Moderate, plateau-like accessibility (2.8–3.4 a.u.) is maintained in many neural derivatives through 30 somites.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Heart myocardium (0 som) → early cardiogenic mesoderm.  
   • Optic cup / prospective retina (15 som) → retinal progenitors.  
   • Secondary enrichment in hindbrain, spinal cord and generic neural pseudobulks; minimal signal in muscle, endoderm or epidermis.

3. Likely regulatory programme  
   • Genes linked to the peaks are highly enriched for RA-responsive patterning and neurogenic factors (rx1/2/3, vsx1/2, six3/6, pax6, otx2, crx, nrl) together with cardiac RA targets (hoxa/b cluster members, gata4/5/6, mef2, tbx5).  
   • GO / pathway themes:  
     – RA-controlled anterior-posterior patterning (HOX, PBX/MEIS).  
     – Specification of cardiac mesoderm and early myocardium.  
     – Eye-field establishment and photoreceptor/retinal neuron differentiation.  
     – Generic neuronal maturation (synaptic adhesion molecules, ion-channels).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
   • Nuclear-receptor RA module: RAR-α/β/γ (rara/rarg/rarga), RXR-α/β, COUP-TFs (NR2F1/2/6).  
   • Homeobox co-factors: PBX1/3/4 & MEIS1/2, HOX paralogs (A/B/C/D clusters).  
   • Eye-field/retina TFs: PAX6, SIX3/6/7, VSX1/2, CRX, NRL.  
   • Cardiac TFs: GATA4/5/6, MEF2 (mef2a/b/c/d), TBX5/20.  
   • RA-responsive bZIP partners: BATF/JUN/FOS family (AP-1) – typical RA co-activators.

Taken together, cluster 24_14 marks RA-responsive enhancers that are first engaged in nascent myocardium and later re-utilised in the optic cup and other neural territories, integrating nuclear-receptor signalling with homeobox/bHLH networks to drive heart and retina morphogenesis during 10-24 hpf zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 24_15

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24_15 corresponds to the classical “myogenic / sarcomere-assembly” program that turns on when paraxial mesoderm begins to differentiate into fast-skeletal muscle fibres.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Low-to-moderate accessibility in gastrulation and early somitogenesis (0-5 somites).  
   • Steady rise by 10–15-somite stage (∼14–18 hpf).  
   • Maximal accessibility at 20- and 30-somite stages (∼19–24 hpf), coinciding with the onset of robust contraction in the trunk/tail musculature.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Fast-muscle lineage: fast_muscle (all time points; 16–19 AU at 10-20 somites).  
   • Developing somites / generic “muscle” pseudobulks.  
   • Paraxial mesoderm (PSM) shows intermediate signals, reflecting the myogenic wave pushing posteriorly.  
   • A striking spike in “hatching_gland_30 somites” (technical or doublet‐rich sample) likely reflects contaminating trunk-muscle nuclei rather than true gland cells; all other hatching-gland ages are low.  
   → Together, the pattern is unequivocally muscle-restricted.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Sarcomere and costamere assembly: ttn.2, smyhc1, actc1, actn3a, myom2a, dmd, ldb3a.  
   • Excitation–contraction coupling & Ca2+ handling: cacna2d1a, kcnma1a, furinb.  
   • Cell-adhesion/remodelling needed for myofibre fusion and alignment: cdh15, neo1a, adamts3, col4a2.  
   • Energy-metabolism support genes (gucy1a1, sgms1, prodha, slc25a21).  
   • Together these define late-myogenesis / contractile maturation.

4. Likely driver transcription factors  
   Enrichment profile pinpoints the canonical myogenic cascade:  
   • Early commitment: Pax3/7 (pax3a/b, pax7a/b motifs).  
   • Determination & differentiation: Myod1, Myf5, Myf6, Myog, Msc (bHLH class; motifs present in TF-set 41/42).  
   • Structural/maturation phase: MEF2 family (mef2a/b/c/d; TF-set 10), SRF, TEAD1/3, and E2F factors (cluster 6/13/59) that couple cell-cycle exit with differentiation.  
   • Modulators/co-factors: Tbx (tbx5/15/16/18/20), Klf family, Runx2/3, and nuclear receptors (NR4A/6A, ROR, PPAR) that fine-tune metabolic adaptation.

In summary, peak cluster 24_15 marks enhancers/promoters that open as trunk paraxial‐mesoderm cells commit to—and mature into—fast-skeletal myofibres between 14 and 24 hpf, driven chiefly by the Myod‐Myog-MEF2 axis.
]

## Cluster 25_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 25_0 captures the chromatin program of the zebrafish haemangioblast → endothelial / early‐haematopoietic lineage.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is detectable already at 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf) but rises steeply through early somitogenesis, peaking between 15- and 20-somites (≈17-21 hpf) and tapering slightly by 30-somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • This timing coincides with in-vivo onset of vasculogenesis, primitive blood specification and the first endothelial sprouts.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest signals (>30–60 arbitrary units) are confined to haemangioblasts and “hematopoietic / vasculature” pseudobulks at every sampled time-point.  
   • All other tissues (somites, muscle, endoderm, heart, neural, etc.) show ≤ 8–10, i.e. ~5- to 10-fold lower accessibility.  
   • Interpretation: the peaks represent enhancers that are almost endothelial-exclusive and already primed in their mesodermal progenitors (haemangioblasts).

3. Regulatory programme encoded  
   Gene set enrichment points to virtually every hallmark of endothelial-blood specification:  
   • Vascular growth & patterning – kdrl/kdr, flt1, flt4, epas1a, clec14a, esama, slit3, rspo4, gpr182.  
   • Haemangioblast / blood identity – tal1, lmo2, gata1a/b, spi1b, gfi1aa/b, runx1/3.  
   • Endothelial junction / ECM – fn1b, col4a1/a2, itga1/9, vcl, cdh5, cldn11, tjp1.  
   • Flow / metabolism modulators – klf2/6, foxo1a/b, smad1, mapk1.  
   Thus the cluster likely harbours enhancers driving vasculogenesis, angiogenic sprouting and the earliest erythro-myeloid waves.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and gene presence converge on:  
   • ETS family: Etv2 (central haemangioblast TF), Fli1a/b, Erg, Elf2/4, Etv5 – highest motif z-scores.  
   • Cloche/Npas4l – pioneer for endothelial programme (gene present).  
   • SCL/Tal1-Lmo2 complex and Runx1 – motifs appear via bHLH/E-box and RUNT sites; genes highly expressed.  
   • GATA factors (Gata1/2/3/6) – support blood/endothelial co-programme.  
   • SoxF sub-group (Sox7, Sox17, Sox18) – arterial/venous differentiation.  
   • FoxC/FoxF/FoxO (foxc1a/b, foxf2a/b, foxo1) – cooperate with ETS in vascular enhancers.  
   • Klf2/6 and Nuclear receptors (Rora/b, Nr2f family) – flow and angiogenic tuning.

In summary, peak-cluster 25_0 represents a temporally dynamic, haemangioblast-specific enhancer set that is activated during 10–22 hpf to establish and refine the endothelial/primitive blood transcriptional network, coordinated chiefly by ETS, Tal1/Lmo2–Gata, SoxF and Fox family transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 25_1

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 25_1 – concise interpretation

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises sharply at early somitogenesis (5-somites, ≈11 hpf), reaches its maximum from 10- to 20-somites (≈14-19 hpf) and remains high through 30-somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • This profile matches the window when endothelial and hemato-vascular progenitors are specified and begin to differentiate.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest signals are confined to the vascular / blood lineages:  
   • Hematopoietic-vasculature (0–30 somites): 32–56 (strongest of all cell types)  
   • Hemangioblasts (5–30 somites): 27–32  
   • Moderate but secondary accessibility in nascent heart myocardium and endoderm; low in neural, muscle or ectodermal derivatives.  
   → The cluster marks the hemangioblast-to-endothelial / hemogenic-endothelium continuum.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Associated gene set is heavily enriched for classical endothelial and early hematopoietic genes: kdrl/kdr, kdrl, flt1, flt4, tek/tie1, cdh5, egfl7, tal1, lmo2, fli1a/b, lmo2, runx1, gata2a/b, etv2, spi1, etc. Functional themes:  
   • Vasculogenesis & angiogenesis (Vegf signalling, arterial/venous identity, vessel lumen formation)  
   • Hemangioblast specification and emergence of hemogenic endothelium  
   • Onset of definitive hematopoiesis/ blood-forming endothelium

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene list)  
   • ETS family: Fli1, Etv2, Erg, Elk3/4, Gabp – core endothelial activators.  
   • GATA factors: Gata2/3/4/5/6 – cooperate with ETS in hemangioblasts and hemogenic endothelium.  
   • TAL1/Scl and its partner Lmo2 – required for both endothelial and blood programmes.  
   • RUNX1 – hallmark of hemogenic endothelium and endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition.  
   • COUP-TF/Nr2f1/2 and nuclear-receptor RXR/RAR motifs – common in endothelial enhancers controlling angiogenic responsiveness.  
   • Secondary contributors: FOX (Foxf/Foxc), SOX-F (Sox7/17/18) and KLF family (Klf2/6/9) that modulate vascular maturation and flow response.

Summary  
Cluster 25_1 comprises enhancers that switch on during early-to-mid somitogenesis specifically in hemangioblasts and emerging endothelial / hemogenic endothelial cells, orchestrated by an ETS–GATA–TAL1/Lmo2-RUNX transcriptional module that controls vasculogenesis, angiogenesis and the first wave of hematopoietic specification in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 25_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 25_2 captures the cis-regulatory landscape of the early blood / hemato-vascular programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at 0–2 somites but rises sharply by 5 somites (≈12 hpf).  
   • It reaches its maximum between 10–20 somites (≈15–20 hpf), tapering slightly by 30 somites (24 hpf).  
   • Thus the cluster coincides with the window when primitive hemangioblasts emerge and differentiate into endothelium and primitive erythrocytes.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest ATAC signal)  
   • Hematopoietic_vasculature (incl. hemogenic endothelium)  
   • Hemangioblasts (blood/endothelial progenitors)  
   • Primitive erythroid-rich tissues such as the hatching-gland/blood-island region  
   • Secondary but noticeable signal in midbrain-hindbrain-boundary cells, reflecting the first vascular sprouts that invade the brain.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Genes linked to the peaks encode classical blood/vascular factors (gata1a/2a, klf1, spi1b/PU.1, fli1a, runx1t1, egfl7, epas1/hif1al2, slc4a1a, hbae5, hbbe2, tfr1a).  
   • Functional enrichment therefore points to:  
     – Specification of hemangioblasts and hemogenic endothelium  
     – Primitive erythropoiesis and early myeloid commitment  
     – Early vascular tube formation and remodelling  
     – Oxygen-sensing / hypoxic response (hif, epo/epor module)

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
   • GATA family (Gata1/2/3) – master regulators of erythroid fate  
   • ETS factors (Fli1, Etv2, Erg, Elf2) – endothelial & hemangioblast identity  
   • SPI1/PU.1 and IRF (Irf2/8) – myelo-erythroid and innate-immune priming  
   • RUNX (Runx1/2/3) – hemogenic endothelium to blood transition  
   • KLF (Klf1/3/9) – erythroid maturation, β-globin activation  
   • Nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR) – retinoic-acid and COUP-modulated vascular gene sets  
   • E2F / cell-cycle module – rapid progenitor proliferation

Together, these peaks mark enhancers that turn on during somitogenesis to drive the first wave of zebrafish blood and vascular development.

## Cluster 25_3

[*assistant*:
Peak Cluster 25_3 – summary interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility first rises at the beginning of segmentation (~0-5 somites, 10-12 hpf) and peaks during mid-somite stages.  
 – Hemangioblast pseudobulks: 53 → 66 → 66 at 5-10-15 somites, then slowly fall.  
 – Hematopoietic/vasculature pseudobulks: 55 at 0 som → steadily climbs to 99 at 30 som (≈24 hpf).  
• Thus the cluster marks regulatory regions switched on as the hemato-vascular program is initiated and remain open while endothelial and blood cells mature.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Hemangioblasts (primitive blood + endothelial precursors)  
• “Hematopoietic / vasculature” endothelium (maturing vascular endothelium / hemogenic endothelium)  
• Secondary but lower signal in paraxial mesoderm (PSM), NMPs and early muscle, consistent with their close developmental origin.

3. Regulatory program encoded by the peaks  
Associated gene set is heavily enriched for canonical vascular-/blood-lineage genes:  
 – Endothelial: kdr/vegfr2, tek/tie2, cdh5 (VE-cadherin), efnb2a, plvap, esama, slit3, robo2, etc.  
 – Hemato-vascular regulators: tal1/tal2, gata1a/1b/2a/2b, runx1/3, gfi1aa/ab, lmo2 (via pbx/meis motifs), erg, fli1, etv2, etc.  
 – Extracellular matrix & migration genes (col14a1b, mmrn2, podxl, spag9a…), reflecting vasculogenesis / angiogenic sprouting.  
Collectively the cluster represents an enhancer module governing vasculogenesis, hemogenic endothelium formation and the first wave of primitive hematopoiesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
• ETS family – Fli1, Etv2, Erg, Elk1/3/4, Gabpa (rows 49, 89-91) → core endothelial/hemangioblast factors.  
• GATA factors – Gata1/2/3/5/6 (row 18, 108) → erythroid/hemogenic specification and endothelial maturation.  
• TAL/TCF family – Tal1/Tal2 with E-box partners (rows 15, 41, 88) – essential for hemo-endothelial gene activation.  
• RUNX – Runx1/3 (row 38, 89) – required for endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition.  
• KLF2/6/9, NRF/NR (rows 86, 89) – shear-stress and metabolic/endocrine modulation of endothelium.  
• PBX/MEIS homeodomain cofactors (row 22, 28, 88) – cooperate with TAL/ETS in hemogenic enhancers.

Taken together, Peak Cluster 25_3 demarcates the enhancer landscape that is switched on in zebrafish hemangioblasts at early somitogenesis and remains active as these cells diverge into endothelial, hemogenic-endothelial and primitive blood lineages, driven predominantly by an ETS-GATA-TAL-RUNX transcriptional cassette.

## Cluster 25_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 25_4 highlights one of the classical “blood-vascular” regulatory modules that switch on during mid-somitogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low at gastrulation/0-somite, rises sharply by 5-somites and reaches its maximum between 10- and 20-somites (≈13-19 hpf).  
   • Most cell types fall back again by 30-somites, except the pharyngeal-arch mesenchyme where accessibility spikes (109 a.u.)—consistent with the later wave of cranial‐vascular/mesenchymal gene activation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessible signal)  
   • Hemangioblasts (5–20 som) and nascent haematopoietic/vascular endothelial lineage (30–60 a.u.).  
   • Haematopoietic vasculature pseudobulks (35–54 a.u.).  
   • Secondary contributors: heart myocardium (10–15 som), endoderm/endocrine pancreas (8–12 a.u.) and late pharyngeal-arch mesenchyme (30 som).

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Genes linked to the peaks (gfi1aa, spi1b/PU.1, alas2, tal1-partners gfi1/gata, itga5, pdgfba, ndst2, mmp9, wnt2bb, zfpm2b) point to:  
     – Primitive / definitive haematopoiesis (erythroid and myeloid priming).  
     – Endothelial specification and early angiogenic remodelling.  
     – Cranial mesoderm / pharyngeal-arch vasculature and extracellular-matrix remodelling.  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene presence)  
   • ETS family: Etv2, Fli1, Erg – endothelial/haemangioblast “starter” factors.  
   • GATA factors (Gata2/3, Gata1) – erythro-vascular competence.  
   • Tal1/Lmo2 complex partners (detected via Gfi1aa, Spi1b motifs).  
   • Spi1/PU.1 and Runx1/Runx3 – myeloid commitment and haemogenic endothelium.  
   • Klf2/6/9 and Nrf (nfe2 family) – shear-stress & erythroid maturation signals.  
   • A late Pax/Six/Hox signature in pharyngeal-arch peaks, explaining the 30-somite craniofacial accessibility surge.

In summary, cluster 25_4 marks cis-regulatory regions that orchestrate the emergence of haemangioblasts, early endothelial/haematopoietic cells and, later, cranial-vascular mesenchyme—driven chiefly by ETS, GATA, Tal1/Lmo2, Spi1 and Runx transcriptional networks.

## Cluster 25_5

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 25_5 marks enhancers that turn on during trunk vasculature formation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at 0 som (∼10 hpf) and rises sharply from 5 som (12 hpf).  
   • It peaks between 20–30 som (∼19–24 hpf), exactly when inter-somitic vessel sprouting and dorsal aorta/cardinal vein remodeling occur.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest pseudobulk signal)  
   • Hematopoietic / vascular endothelium (27 → 48 AU from 5 to 20 som)  
   • Lateral-plate mesoderm / early endothelium (9 → 16 AU)  
   • Hemangioblasts and endothelial-lined organs (heart endocardium, endocrine pancreas) show intermediate signal.  
   • Most other tissues stay near baseline (∼3–6 AU).

3. Implied regulatory programme  
   Gene set is enriched for classical endothelial/angiogenic components:  
   • VEGF receptors (kdr, flt4), Tie1, Rasip1, Epas1, Egfl7, Sox18, Gja5/Cx40, Cx43, Talin (tln1), Integrins (itga4/9), cell-junction and ECM genes (adam19, bmp1, slit3, reck).  
   ➔ Indicates specification of hemogenic endothelium, sprouting/cord formation, lumenization and early blood-flow adaptation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (top enriched motifs & expressed factors)  
   • ETS family: Etv2, Fli1a/b, Erg, Ets1/2 – core endothelial pioneers.  
   • SOX18 (and SOX7/17) – venous/lymphatic endothelial identity.  
   • FOX-C/F group: Foxc1/2, Foxf1/2 – cooperate with ETS for vascular enhancers.  
   • GATA2/6 – hemogenic and arterial programmes.  
   • COUP-TF (Nr2f1/2) & Nuclear-receptor cluster – venous differentiation, angiogenic metabolism.  
   • HIF2α/Epas1 motif present (hypoxia-responsive vascular growth).

Together, cluster 25_5 represents the cis-regulatory package that drives mesoderm-to-endothelium transition and subsequent angiogenesis during 12–24 hpf zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 25_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 25_6 corresponds to an endothelial / hemato-vascular enhancer program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises sharply between 5- and 10-somite stages (≈ 13–15 hpf), reaches its maximum at 15–20 somites (≈ 16–19 hpf), and diminishes by 30 somites (24 hpf).  
   • This timing matches the burst of vasculogenesis and the transition from hemangioblasts to functional endothelium in zebrafish embryos.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signal)  
   • Hemangioblasts (24–26 a.u. at 5–15 somites)  
   • Haematopoietic / endothelial vasculature (25–48 a.u. at 5–30 somites)  
   • Secondary but lower signal in pharyngeal-arch mesenchyme, endoderm and early myocardium, consistent with endothelial cells invading these tissues.  

3. Implied biological programme  
   Gene set is enriched for classical vascular / endothelial regulators and effectors:  
   – Receptors & signalling: kdr/kdrl (Vegfr2), tie1, ramp2, tgfbr2a/b, wnt5b, epas1b (Hif2)  
   – ETS/FOXO/SOX endothelium TFs: erg, fli1-like, foxo1b, sox7  
   – Junction / lumen formation: rasip1, lama2, tjp2b, abca4b/abcg2a (barrier function)  
   – Haemogenic cues: spi1b (pu.1), runx1-pathway genes  
   – ECM / migration: adam12, fgd4b, tnn, tspan17  

   Together these elements point to enhancers that drive specification of angioblasts, endothelial sheet formation and early vascular remodeling (including haemogenic endothelium emergence).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
   • ETS family: ETV2 / ERG / FLI1 (strongest motif Z-scores ≈ 0.9–1.1) – master activators of endothelial genes.  
   • FOX factors: FOXC1/FOXC2, FOXO1/FOXO3 – cooperate with ETS factors for arterial identity and vessel stability.  
   • SOX7 / SOX17 – arterial/haemogenic endothelium specification.  
   • GATA2/3 – haemangioblast and blood lineage competence.  
   • RUNX & SPI1 (PU.1) motifs – consistent with haemogenic/endothelial crossover.  
   • Secondary support: KLF (Klf2/6/9), NFAT and TEAD motifs, known shear-response and angiogenic regulators.

Summary: Peak-cluster 25_6 contains enhancers that switch on during the 5-20-somite window in hemangioblasts and nascent endothelial cells, orchestrated mainly by ETS-FOX-SOX-GATA TF combinations to drive vasculogenesis, endothelial maturation and the first wave of blood/vascular development in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 25_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 25_7 marks a classic “hemato-vascular” enhancer program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at 0-somite but rises steeply during early–mid somitogenesis, peaking between 15- and 20-somite stages (~16–19 hpf).  
   • Signal remains high at 30-somites but begins to taper, indicating activation during the window when endothelial tubes form and hematopoietic progenitors emerge.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is confined to the two hemato-vascular populations:  
   • Hemangioblasts (10–20 somites: 15–20 a.u.)  
   • Hematopoietic/vasculature precursors (10–30 somites: 20–24 a.u.)  
   Secondary but lower signal appears in nascent endothelium (endocardium/heart myocardium) and general endoderm, consistent with shared mesendodermal origin.

3. Regulatory program inferred  
   Associated genes are enriched for endothelial- and blood-lineage loci (kdrl/kdrl, flt1, kdr, tie1, vegfc, cdh5, esama, fli1a/b, etv2, tal1, runx1, gata1/2, hbae/hbbe).  GO terms point to:  
   • Vasculogenesis / angiogenic sprouting  
   • Endothelial barrier formation and lumenization  
   • Hematopoietic stem cell specification and erythroid maturation  
   • Retinoic-acid / COUP-TF signalling that modulates arterial-venous identity

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and TF–gene overlap highlight a canonical hemato-endothelial cassette:  
   • ETS family: Etv2, Fli1, Erg, Ets1/2 – master initiators of endothelial fate  
   • GATA factors & Tal1/Scl – required for hemangioblast and erythroid programmes  
   • Runx1 – definitive hematopoietic stem-cell emergence  
   • COUP-TF-NR2F1/2 and RAR/RXR nuclear receptors – retinoic/venous patterning inputs  
   • FOXC1/FOXF2 and SOX17/18 – arterial specification and endothelium maturation modifiers  

Together, cluster 25_7 demarcates enhancers that turn on in hemangioblasts just as they bifurcate into endothelial and blood lineages, driving construction of the early zebrafish vasculature and first hematopoietic cells.
]

## Cluster 25_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 25_8 marks a vascular/hemangioblast enhancer program that switches on soon after somitogenesis begins and remains active while the first endothelial and blood cells are being generated.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is low during gastrulation (0-somite).  
• A sharp rise is seen at 5 somites and reaches a plateau between 10-20 somites (≈14–20 hpf).  
• Signal remains elevated, but slightly tapers, by 30 somites (≈24 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Hematopoietic/vascular lineage – “hematopoietic vasculature” and “hemangioblasts” show the strongest signal at every measured stage (11–20 arbitrary units).  
• Early endothelial derivatives (heart myocardium, endocardium equivalents) and generic “PSM/mesoderm” display intermediate signal (3-6 units).  
• A transient spike in primordial germ cells at 5 somites (28 units) is observed but disappears thereafter; this is likely a technical carry-over from mesodermal precursors rather than a true germ-cell program.

3. Regulated biological processes  
Gene set points to canonical vasculogenesis / early hematopoiesis:  
• Endothelial identity & angiogenic signalling – flt4/vegfr3, tie1, egfl7, cdh5, mcamb, lama4, lamb1b, hyal2, selp.  
• Hemangioblast / blood specification – gfi1aa, klf1, runx family, grna, gata genes, rhd/rhag (erythroid), f2 (coagulation).  
• Cell-adhesion & ECM remodelling – col6a4a, crim1, itga/b genes, rspo2, ptx3a.  
Hence the cluster tags enhancers that coordinate endothelial sprouting, vascular lumen formation, and the first wave of blood-cell differentiation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene list)  
Highly enriched motifs and/or expressed TFs in this cluster correspond to:  
• ETS family (Etv2, Fli1, Erg, Elf2/4, Ets1) – master regulators of endothelial fate.  
• SOX-F subgroup (Sox7, Sox17, Sox18) – arterial/venous identity and angiogenic competence.  
• GATA factors (Gata2a/b, Gata1, Gata3) – hemangioblast and erythroid programmes.  
• KLF factors (Klf2, Klf6/17, Klf9) – shear-stress–responsive endothelial maturation.  
• FOX (Foxf1/f2, Foxc1/c2) and COUP-TF/Nr2f (nr2f1/2/6) – vascular patterning and venous specification.  
• RUNX (Runx1/2/3) – definitive hematopoiesis.  
• MEF2 and E2F signatures reflect high proliferation and cytoskeletal remodelling typical of nascent endothelium.

Together, peak-cluster 25_8 delineates a temporally restricted, endothelial-hemangioblast enhancer set that becomes accessible as paraxial mesoderm gives rise to hemangioblasts, driving the transcriptional cascade for vasculature assembly and the first blood cells in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 25_9

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 25_9 marks the “early vaso-cardiac program”

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility already detectable at 0-somite (10 hpf) but rises sharply during 5-, 10- and 15-somite stages (≈11–17 hpf) – the window when zebrafish hemangioblasts, nascent endothelium and the linear heart tube are specified.  
• Signal falls after 20-somites and is clearly lower by 30-somites (24 hpf), indicating that the regions are linked to early specification rather than later maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest mean accessibility)  
• Hemangioblasts (5–15 som): 38–62  
• Hematopoietic / vascular endothelium (0–15 som): 45→37  
• Heart myocardium / endocardium (0–15 som): 25→36  
• Endocrine-pancreas & foregut endoderm show moderate signal, reflecting shared Gata/Fox enhancers; most other lineages remain at baseline.

3. Biological program represented  
Genes in the cluster are a textbook list of early endothelial / blood-vessel and cardiac regulators:  
 • Vasculogenesis / angiogenesis: flt4, kdr, tie1, vegfc, dll4, egfl7, rasip1, angptl2, rxraa  
 • Hemangioblast / primitive hematopoiesis: etv2, tal1, hemgn, gata1, vwf  
 • Cardiac tube formation & looping: bmp10, bmp6, wnt11, wnt5b, mef2cb, ryr2, gata5/6  
 • Endodermal foregut & pancreas links: sox17, foxh1, gata5/6, dab2  
Functional enrichment therefore points to:  
 • Specification of hemangioblasts → endothelial & primitive blood lineages  
 • Assembly of the primary vascular network and endocardium  
 • Concurrent early cardiomyocyte differentiation  
 • Shared endoderm/mesoderm enhancers used by emerging pancreas

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
• ETS family (Etv2, Fli1, Erg, Elf2/4) – master activators of endothelial genes  
• GATA factors (Gata5/6 for heart/endoderm; Gata1/2 for blood)  
• FOX family (FoxC1/FoxF1/FoxH1/FoxA) – arterial-venous and endoderm enhancers  
• TAL1 / LMO, RUNX1/3 – hemangioblast to hematopoietic transition  
• MEF2 (Mef2cb/ca) & TBX (Tbx5/20) – early cardiomyocyte program  
• NR2F/COUP-TF and RXR/RAR nuclear receptors – fine-tune endothelial fate

In summary, cluster 25_9 contains enhancers that switch on during somitogenesis in hemangioblasts, nascent endothelium and the forming heart, driving early vascular and cardiac gene expression via an ETS–FOXC/GATA-centered regulatory network.
]

## Cluster 25_10

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 25_10 – concise biological interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises steadily after gastrulation and shows its largest jump between 10- and 20-somite stages, reaching a maximum at 30 somites (~24 hpf).  
• Early accessibility “seed” is already present in hemangioblasts (5–10 somites), suggesting this cluster marks the transition from angioblast/hemangioblast to fully patterned vasculature.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signals)  
• Hematopoietic/vascular endothelium      » 60–100 a.u. (dominant)  
• Hemangioblast progenitors                » 25–30 a.u. (early)  
• Heart myocardium & somites/epidermis     » 12–18 a.u. (secondary)  
The profile therefore tracks endothelial lineage maturation with minor activity in closely allied mesodermal derivatives (myocardium, somite-derived perivascular cells, epidermis).

3. Implied regulatory programme  
Gene set and motif content point to:  
• Angioblast specification → endothelial tube formation (fli1a, pdgfra, nrp2a, ptprb, prkg1a, veph1, thsd7a, tgfbi, mmp14b).  
• Extracellular-matrix/adhesion remodeling and vessel sprouting (itga9, tns2/3, robo3, sema6bb, lpar1, mmp14b).  
• FoxO-/TGFβ- / Hippo-dependent endothelial stabilisation (foxo1a, vgll4b, fstl1b, tgfbr3).  
Overall, the cluster represents the chromatin programme that establishes and refines vascular/endothelial identity and vessel morphogenesis during early organogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (enriched motifs & expressed factors)  
Primary ETS / vascular core: Fli1, Erg, Etv2/4/5 – master activators of endothelial genes  
Forkhead factors: FOXC1/2, FOXF2, FOXL1, FOXO1 – endothelial identity & vessel maturation  
GATA factors: Gata2/6 – hemangioblast specification and venous fate  
Nuclear receptors: NR2F2 (COUP-TFII), RAR/RXR, PPAR – arterial/venous patterning & retinoid response  
KLF/MEF2/KDM2B axis: flow-responsive Klf2/6 and Mef2a/c for shear-induced programmes  
RUNX1/3 – endothelial-to-hematopoietic priming  
Together these TFs form a coherent endothelial/vascular gene-regulatory network that becomes progressively more accessible and active from 10 somites onward, culminating in robust vascular-specific chromatin accessibility by 24 hpf.
]

## Cluster 25_11

[*assistant*:
Interpretation of Peak-cluster 25_11  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises steadily from gastrulation (0-som) and is maximal at 15-20-somite stages, remaining high at 30-somites.  
  → corresponds to the window (14-24 hpf) when the lateral plate mesoderm gives rise to haemangioblasts, endothelial sheets lumenise and primitive erythro-/myelopoiesis starts.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• haemangioblasts (6.1 → 11.8)  
• ‘hematopoietic_vasculature’ endothelial progenitors (6.0 → 14.8)  
• moderate in heart myocardium and tail-bud mesoderm, very low in neural / endodermal derivatives.  
Thus the cluster marks the shared haemato-vascular lineage.

3. Regulatory programme encoded  
Enriched peak-linked genes point to vascular/endothelial and early blood functions. Examples:  
– Endothelial adhesion & tube formation: cdh5 (VE-cadherin), pecam1, esama, stab2, esama, esama.  
– VEGF/angiogenic signalling: flt4 (Vegfr3), ednraa, pfkfb3, flna.  
– Haemangioblast / HSC regulators: gfi1aa/b, tal1, runx1 (motifs), alas2 (erythroid), mpl (thrombopoietic), f13a1b/f2 (coagulation).  
– ECM & migration: agrn, flna, fmn2a, ripor3.  
Overall the peaks appear to coordinate endothelial specification, vessel sprouting and the first wave of primitive haematopoiesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
• ETS family: Etv2 / Fli1 / Erg / Elk1/4 – master activators of vascular genes.  
• GATA factors: Gata2/3/6 (and Gata1 in erythroid subset) – cooperate with ETS in haemato-vascular specification.  
• RUNX & TAL (Runx1/3, Tal1) – initiation of blood programme.  
• KLFs (Klf2, Klf6/9) – flow-responsive endothelial maturation.  
• COUP-TF/Nr2f1/2/6 and RXR/RAR nuclear receptors – venous identity & retinoic-acid signalling in endothelium.  

Summary: Peak-cluster 25_11 represents a haemangioblast / nascent endothelial regulatory module that turns on during mid-somitogenesis, driving angiogenesis and the first haematopoietic differentiation through a core ETS–GATA–RUNX/TAL transcriptional network.

## Cluster 25_12

[*assistant*:
Biological synopsis of Peak-cluster 25_12

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already above background at the 0–5-somite stage but rises steeply thereafter.  
• Maximum signal is seen at 15–30 somites (≈18–24 hpf), where hemangioblast and nascent vasculature pseudobulks reach 10–13-fold the global median.  
→ The cis-regulatory program switches on during early segmentation and stays high through early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Hemangioblasts (5 – 30 somites)  
• Hematopoietic / vascular endothelium (0 – 30 somites)  
• Secondary but lower signal in heart myocardium and other mesodermal/endothelial-containing tissues  
→ The cluster marks the blood-vascular lineage, from bipotent hemangioblasts to endothelial progenitors.

3. Likely biological processes regulated  
Enriched gene set and ontology terms point to:  
• Vasculogenesis and angiogenic sprouting (flt1, flt4, kdr/vegfr2, vegfc, tie1, esama, pecam1, tal1, etv2)  
• Endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition / early hematopoiesis (runx1, gfi1a/b, spi1a/b, tal1, gata2b)  
• Vascular extracellular matrix and lumen formation (col4a1/a2, lama/b, mmp14, stab2)  
• VEGF, Notch and ETS signaling modules  
Hence, cluster 25_12 corresponds to the core endothelial / hemangioblast regulatory landscape that establishes the primitive vasculature and seeds definitive blood formation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + expressed factors)  
• ETS family: Etv2 (master hemangioblast TF), Fli1a/b, Erg, Elk3/4 – highest motif scores and strong gene expression.  
• GATA factors: Gata2b (vascular/hematopoietic), Gata4/5/6 (lateral-plate & endocardium).  
• TAL/LMO complex: Tal1 (Scl) and Lmo2 cooperate with ETS/GATA for hemogenic endothelium.  
• FOX & SOX vascular regulators: Foxc1/2, Foxf1/2, Sox7/17/18.  
• KLFs 2/6/17 and Klf2-responsive shear-stress program (consistent with later endothelial maturation).  
• RUNX1, SPI1 (Pu.1) – cueing the endothelial-to-hematopoietic switch.  
• NFAT, RBPJ (Notch) motifs also enriched, supporting vascular remodeling signals.

In summary, peak-cluster 25_12 defines the enhancer repertoire that is activated in hemangioblasts at ~10 hpf, intensifies through 24 hpf, and is driven by an ETS-GATA-TAL/LMO regulatory cassette to orchestrate vasculogenesis and the first wave of hematopoiesis in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 26_0

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 26_0 marks a set of regulatory elements that open progressively during segmentation and early organogenesis and are shared by several trunk-derived lineages.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility starts modestly at 0–5-somite stage and climbs steadily, reaching a maximum at 20–30 somites (≈ 22–24 hpf).  
   • The monotonic increase suggests these regions are engaged after initial lineage allocation, during maturation of somites, muscle and midbrain structures.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest values)  
   • Somitic lineage: formed somites > paraxial mesoderm (PSM) > neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs).  
   • Midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) neuroepithelium – equally high, mirroring Pax2/5/8-dependent enhancer use.  
   • Neural-crest / trunk muscle (fast-muscle, generic muscle) and heart myocardium show intermediate accessibility.  
   • Endocrine pancreas and haemato-vascular endothelium display moderate but consistent signal, fitting a RA-responsive mesoderm/endoderm module.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   Integrated gene list points to axial patterning, segmentation and early myogenesis.  Notable themes:  
   • Hox, Meox1/2, Pbx/Meis, RAR/RXR and COUP-TF targets → retinoic-acid–driven anterior-posterior identity of somites and MHB.  
   • Pax3/7, FoxC/F/D, Tbx1/15/18, Mesp-like, Meis, Lef1/Wnt components → specification and maturation of paraxial mesoderm and its derivatives (skeletal muscle, dermis, axial skeleton).  
   • Mef2, Tead/Yap and MyoD/Mrf motifs → onset of muscle differentiation.  
   • Engrailed/En, Fgf and Pax2/5/8 genes → patterning of the midbrain-hindbrain organizer.  
   • ECM and morphogenesis genes (col1a1, fn1a, has2) → connective-tissue build-up during trunk elongation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (highest motif enrichment & matching expressed genes)  
   • RAR/RXR family (rarga/b, rxraa/b, nr2f1/2) – RA response core.  
   • Hox–Pbx–Meis triad – positional identity & segmentation.  
   • Pax3/7 and Pax2/5/8 – somitic dermomyotome and MHB organiser.  
   • FoxC1/2, FoxD3/FoxF – mesoderm & neural-crest regulators.  
   • Tbx (Tbx1/15/18/5) – pharyngeal/somitic mesoderm patterning.  
   • Mef2 (mef2cb/d) and Tead1/3 – transition to myogenic differentiation.  
   • COUP-TFs (Nr2f) and RORs – integrate RA with circadian/metabolic cues.  

Collectively, peak cluster 26_0 delineates RA-responsive, Hox/Pax/Fox-controlled enhancers that become increasingly active as paraxial mesoderm segments, somites mature, and adjacent neural (MHB) tissues are patterned, thereby coordinating trunk morphogenesis and the onset of skeletal-muscle and midbrain differentiation in the 10–24 hpf window.
]

## Cluster 26_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 26_1 corresponds to a large set of cis-regulatory elements that are open very early in development, broadly accessible in many lineages, but with a clear bias toward the primordial germ-cell (PGC) lineage and a “nuclear-receptor” motif signature.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is highest at gastrula/very early segmentation (0–10-somite stages) in most tissues.  
• In most somatic lineages the signal gradually declines through 15-, 20- and 30-somites.  
• Primordial germ cells remain highly accessible throughout every sampled stage (88–93 vs. 40-70 in other cell types), indicating persistent activity in the germ-line.

2. Cell-type specificity of peak accessibility  
Highest: Primordial germ cells 0–30 som (top values).  
High/medium early: Neuro-mesodermal progenitors, paraxial mesoderm (PSM/somites), early endoderm and neural progenitors.  
Lower: Differentiated derivatives at 30 som (muscle, epidermis, brain, etc.).

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
• Motif enrichment is dominated by DR-type half–sites bound by nuclear hormone receptors.  
• Associated gene list is enriched for retinoid-, steroid- and lipid-metabolism genes (cyp26, rdh, ppar, thr, rorb, nr1h*, nr5a*), pluripotency/germ-cell factors (nanog, lin28a/b, td rd7b, prdm1a) and many housekeeping metabolic genes.  
Taken together, the cluster represents a “nuclear-receptor metabolic module” that:  
a) primes early embryonic cells for retinoic-acid, thyroid-hormone and PPAR signalling that drive axis-extension, mesoderm patterning and metabolic maturation, and  
b) stays open in PGCs, consistent with their continued sensitivity to retinoid/steroid cues for sex-determination and germ-cell maintenance.

4. Key transcription factors likely driving the programme  
Motif & gene enrichment point to a cadre of nuclear receptors:  
• Retinoic-acid receptors Rarg(a/b), Rxr(a/b)  
• COUP-TFs Nr2f1/2 (Coup-TFI/II)  
• Orphan RORs Rorb, Rorc  
• PPARs Ppara, Pparg, Ppard  
• NR5A family Sf1/Lrh1 (Nr5a1/2)  
• Rev-Erbs Nr1d1/2 (circadian metabolic link)  
• Thyroid-hormone receptors Thraa/Thrb  
Co-factors: Lin28a/b, Nanog, Klf family, Gata factors (early germ-layer competence).

In summary, peak-cluster 26_1 marks an early, broadly active but PGC-enriched set of enhancers/promoters that integrate nuclear-receptor signalling to coordinate metabolic and retinoid/steroid-responsive gene expression during the gastrula-to-organogenesis transition, with sustained activity in the developing germ line.
]

## Cluster 26_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 26_2 behaves like a “house-keeping / promoter” module that stays accessible in almost every cell throughout somitogenesis and early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at 10 hpf (0-somite) and changes only modestly thereafter (e.g. NMPs 246 → 254; PSM 248 → 244; neurons 205 → 213).  
• Slight upward shift at the late (30-somite, 24 hpf) samples suggests global chromatin relaxation that accompanies the burst of transcription seen when embryos enter organogenesis, but no sharp time-restricted peak is observed.  →  Cluster 26_2 is constitutively open from gastrulation through 24 hpf.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• Nearly all pseudobulks lie in the same narrow range (≈190–260).  
• The very highest values are in rapidly proliferating, metabolically active tissues – tailbud, NMP/PSM, nascent somites, fast muscle, beating myocardium and hematopoietic/vascular endothelium – but neural, endodermal and epidermal populations are only marginally lower.  
→  Accessibility is essentially ubiquitous; modest enrichment in proliferative mesodermal derivatives reflects their higher global transcriptional output rather than lineage specificity.

3. Regulatory program inferred from linked genes  
• >1,000 linked transcripts encode ribosomal proteins, RNA-processing factors, core metabolic enzymes (glycolysis, TCA, oxidative phosphorylation), cell-cycle regulators, DNA-replication/repair proteins and general transcription/translation machinery.  
• Virtually no lineage-restricted marker genes are over-represented.  
→  Cluster 26_2 corresponds to CpG-rich promoters that drive basal/house-keeping functions such as energy production, macromolecular biosynthesis and cell-cycle progression.

4. Key transcription-factor inputs  
Motif enrichment is broad but the factors most compatible with a constitutive promoter program are:  
• KDM2B/CXXC module – kdm2ba motif enrichment (binds unmethylated CpG islands and recruits Pol II).  
• SP/KLF & NF-Y family (Sp1/Sp3, Klf5/6/9, NFYA/L) – classical GC-box / CCAAT-box promoter regulators.  
• E2F/DP complex (E2F1/2/3/5/7/8, TFDP1/2) – coordinates cell-cycle and DNA-replication gene expression.  
• ETS factors (Elf1/2, Gabpa, Etv family, Fli1/Ets2) – general Pol II promoter activators.  
• Forkhead/FOXK & FOXO – bind broad CpG promoters and couple metabolism to transcription.  
• Nuclear-receptor RXR/NR2F/ESRR cluster – promiscuous binding to many active promoters.

Taken together, peak-cluster 26_2 represents a ubiquitously accessible set of CpG-rich promoter elements that support core metabolic and proliferative programs in all zebrafish embryonic cells from gastrulation through early organ formation, rather than a lineage-restricted developmental regulator.
]

## Cluster 26_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 26_3 captures a “ventral-midline + early myotome” chromatin programme that is switched on at the onset of somitogenesis and is shared between the neural floor plate, nascent somites / myotome and closely related midline derivatives.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0-somite (10 hpf) samples and reaches its maximum during the 0–5-somite window.  
   • Values remain elevated through 30 somites (24 hpf) but slowly taper, indicating a programme that is initiated early and maintained during early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Neural_floor_plate and Floor_plate (≈ 80-108 normalised units)  
   • Muscle / Somites / Tail-bud pseudobulks (≈ 93-108 units)  
   • Differentiating_neurons and Hindbrain (≈ 60-70 units)  
   Lower accessibility is seen in endoderm, epidermis, etc. → The peaks are therefore most specific to ventral neural-tube (floor plate) and paraxial-mesoderm / myotome lineages.

3. Inferred biological processes  
   Gene and motif content point to four, highly interconnected pathways:  
   • Hedgehog–Gli axis for ventral neural-tube and floor-plate identity (shha, shhb, gli1/2 motifs).  
   • Wnt/Tbx segmentation network for paraxial-mesoderm patterning (wnt3/4/8b, lef1, tbx20/6/16).  
   • Myogenic differentiation (myod1, myf5/6, mef2a/c/d, myog).  
   • A-P positional information and neural subtype patterning (dense Hox, Pax3/7, Lhx, Msx lists).  
   Together these peaks likely regulate establishment of the floor plate, ventral spinal-cord progenitors and the first wave of fast-muscle/myotome differentiation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched & cognate genes present)  
   • Gli1/2/3 ‒ main Hedgehog effectors.  
   • FoxA2 / FoxD3 / FoxO (Fox motifs) – ventral midline/floor-plate activators.  
   • Nkx2.2 / Nkx2.4 – ventral spinal cord identity.  
   • MEF2 (Mef2aa/b/c/d) and SRF – muscle gene activation.  
   • MyoD + Myf5/6 – initiate myogenic programme.  
   • TCF/LEF family – integrate canonical Wnt signalling in somites.  
   • T-box factors (Tbx6/16/20) – mesodermal segmentation.  
   • Hox/Pax/Lhx cohorts – positional and neuronal subtype codes.  
   • Nuclear receptors (ROR, RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF) – modulate differentiation timing.

In summary, cluster 26_3 represents an early, Hedgehog/Wnt-responsive regulatory module that coordinately drives ventral neural-tube (floor-plate) patterning and the emergence of neighbouring paraxial-mesoderm / myotome tissues during zebrafish somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 26_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 26_4 – concise biological read-out

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises steadily through segmentation; highest values at 15- & 30-somite stages (≈ 20–24 hpf).  
• Earlier gastrula/5-som stage levels are half to two-thirds of the later peak, indicating a programme switched on during late neurulation / early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Top-accessible pseudobulks (all time-points averaged)  
• Neural floor plate & floor plate (315-436)  
• Hindbrain neural tube (317-429)  
• Midbrain-hindbrain boundary (308-384)  
• Differentiating CNS neurons (230-270)  
• Secondary high but lower: optic cup, dorsal spinal cord, NMP/PSM around tail-bud.  

Thus the cluster marks the ventral midline and posterior midbrain / hindbrain regions of the developing neural tube and the early differentiating neuronal pool.

3. Likely regulatory programme  
Gene set is highly enriched for factors and ligands that pattern and wire the midbrain–hindbrain & ventral neural tube. Highlighted processes:  
• A–P and D–V neural patterning – otx1/2, gbx1/2, en2, pax2/5/6, wnt1/3a/4/11, fgf8a, fgfr1-4, gli1/3, lef1, nkd1.  
• Floor-plate / hedgehog response – foxa2, lmx1b, gli genes, slit2, robo1, netrin (ntn1b).  
• Rhombomere & hindbrain segmentation – multiple HoxB/C/D genes, msx, irx, lfng, eph/ephrin sets, robo/slit.  
• Axon guidance & early neuronal differentiation – neurog1, olig2/3/4, pou3f, zic2-5, sema3, plxna/b, ephs, ptch2.  
• Retinoic-acid & COUP/NR signalling (rar/rxr/nr2f family) suggesting coupling to RA gradients.

Overall, cluster 26_4 represents the chromatin programme that builds the floor-plate and midbrain–hindbrain/hindbrain territories, coordinates neuronal subtype generation and pioneers longitudinal axon tracts.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment together with the co-accessible gene set points to:  
• Midbrain–hindbrain organisers: Otx1/2, Engrailed (En1/2), Gbx1/2, Pax2/5/6.  
• Ventral/floor-plate determinants: Foxa2, Foxb1, Lmx1a/b, Gli1/3 (Hh pathway).  
• Broad neural stem factors: Sox2/3/11, Zic2-5, SoxB1 family.  
• Hox & Msx/Irx clusters for hindbrain & spinal cord AP patterning.  
• TCF/Lef and RAR/RXR/COUP-TF (Nr2f) nuclear receptors integrating Wnt and RA signals.  
• E2F/Tead signatures reflect proliferative neural progenitors but drop as differentiation peaks.

Together these TFs explain both the spatial (ventral midline + MHB/hindbrain) and temporal (late segmentation surge) accessibility profile of peak-cluster 26_4.
]

## Cluster 26_5

[*assistant*:
Peak–cluster 26_5 corresponds to a broad, early “epithelial / neural-crest programme”.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is highest at the beginning of the somitogenesis series (0-10 somites ≈ 10–14 hpf), falls modestly by 15 somites and drops further by 20-30 somites (≈ 20-24 hpf).  
   • Example: epidermis 168 → 118; enteric-neuron progenitors 121 → 32; NMP/PSM 55 → 36.  
   • Interpretation – the programme is switched on just after gastrulation, during early segmentation, and is progressively shut down as organogenesis begins, except in a few epithelial derivatives (e.g. endocrine pancreas) where it remains moderately active.

2. Cell-type specificity (top accessibility)  
   • Surface ectoderm / epidermis / periderm  
   • Early neural-crest–derived populations (enteric-neuron lineage, general “neural crest”)  
   • Endocrine-pancreatic epithelium (definitive endoderm)  
   • Early somite / tail-bud mesoderm show intermediate but declining signal.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   Gene set is rich for:  
   • Epithelial/barrier components – epcam, cldn23, oclna, krt4, lama5, col1/4/18, integrins (itga3/5/9), tight-junction and polarity genes (tjp1, pard3/6, crb3).  
   • EMT / migration regulators – sox10, tfap2a/c, prrx1, snai1, zeb2, twist1, msx/dlx family, wnt5b, fgfr1/2/4, bmpr1.  
   • Epidermal-differentiation TFs – tp63, grhl2/3, ovol1.  
   • ECM remodellers – adamts, mmp2/15, tagln2, dcn, fbn2.  
   This constellation is classic for (i) specification and maturation of surface ectoderm/periderm, (ii) epithelial–mesenchymal transition and migration of trunk/cranial neural-crest cells, and (iii) early epithelial organisation of endodermal buds such as pancreas.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched & genes present)  
   • SOX family – SOX10/5/9/12/18 (crest and periderm)  
   • TFAP2A/C/D and TP63 – master regulators of surface ectoderm and crest EMT  
   • FOX factors – FOXD3, FOXI1/3, FOXG1/K2/F1 (epithelial polarity, crest competence)  
   • PAX3/7, DLX3/5/6, MSX1/2 – neural-crest and craniofacial patterning  
   • GRHL2/3 and KLF5/6 – epithelial barrier formation  
   • Nuclear receptors NR2F1/2/6 (COUP-TFs), RXR/RAR – retinoid signalling tied to epithelial morphogenesis  
   • ETS (Fli1/Etv), RUNX, MEF2 – support migratory and mesenchymal behaviours  
   • GATA3/4/6 and TEAD/TCF factors – reinforce epithelial and Wnt/Yap-responsive genes.

Together, these features indicate that cluster 26_5 marks cis-regulatory elements that coordinate early epidermal/periderm specification and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal events that launch neural-crest migration, with secondary use in later epithelial organs such as the endocrine pancreas.
]

## Cluster 26_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 26_6 marks the “posterior‐paraxial mesoderm / axis–extension” programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at the first sampled stage (0-somite, ≈10 hpf), remains maximal through the active segmentation window (5–15 somites, ≈11–18 hpf) and starts to taper by 20–30 somites (≈20–24 hpf).  
   • Thus the cluster follows the period of tail-bud outgrowth and somite addition.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest ATAC signal)  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs)  
   • Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) & tail-bud core  
   • Newly formed somites / early fast muscle  
   • Moderate signal in notochord and hemangioblasts; low in neural/endodermal derivatives.

3. Regulatory/biological programme inferred  
   • Posterior body-axis extension and segmentation: msgn1, tbx16/​tbx6, tbxta/brachyury, her7, dlc, cdx genes, multiple Hox paralogues.  
   • Wnt/FGF signalling hub (fgf8a/​17/​10a/b, wnt5b, sp5/​tcf7).  
   • Retinoic-acid and RA-antagonist network (ralgds, cyp26a1, raraa/b/g, rargb).  
   • EMT and mesenchymal migration genes (snai1a, id3, foxf/​foxc, itga5/​itga11b, fn1b, col8/18).  
   • Early vascular/myotome cues (vegf co-receptors nrp1a/b, angpt4, plxna2/a3, myf-independent mymk).  
   Collectively these peaks correspond to chromatin that coordinates posterior axial identity, segmentation clock activity and transition of paraxial mesoderm into nascent somites.

4. Likely key transcription factors (motif enrichment + gene list)  
   • T-box factors: Brachyury (Tbxta), Tbx16/​Tbx6 – drive NMP and PSM gene batteries.  
   • CDX & HOX code: Cdx1a/4 and numerous Hox paralogues establish rostro–caudal identity.  
   • Wnt/β-catenin effectors: LEF/TCF (tcf7/​tcf7l1/​tcf7l2) and SP5/SP5l motifs.  
   • RA receptors / COUP-TFs / NR6A1: enriched nuclear-receptor motifs (RARα/β/γ, NR2F, NR6A1) matching the RA-gradient modulators of segmentation.  
   • Mesogenin (Msgn1) and basic HLH clock components (Her/​Hes) likely bind some peaks but lack dedicated motifs in the library.  
   • Supporting regulators: FOX (foxf/f)/GATA for mesenchymal state, E2F for high proliferation in tail-bud.

Together, cluster 26_6 delineates the cis-regulatory landscape that keeps posterior neuromesodermal progenitors and presomitic mesoderm poised for continued axial elongation and iterative somite formation during 10–24 hpf zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 26_7

[*assistant*:
Peak‐cluster 26_7 represents a set of broadly active, retinoid/nuclear-receptor–responsive regulatory elements that are opened very early in zebrafish development and then become progressively restricted to retinoic-acid–rich neuro-ectodermal derivatives.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at 0-somite stage (10 hpf) in virtually all tissues (~50 AU).  
• It gradually falls through the 20–30 somite stages (22–24 hpf) in most lineages (to the high-30s).  
• An exception is the eye field/optic cup, where accessibility continues to rise, peaking at >70 AU by 30 somites, indicating prolonged activity there.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Optic cup / eye primordium (>70 AU).  
• Posterior axial progenitors – tail-bud, NMPs, presomitic mesoderm, spinal cord (mid-40–50 AU).  
• Hox-positive hindbrain/spinal neural tube and somites.  
• Much lower signals in notochord and endoderm (≤35 AU).

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
The peak list is strongly enriched for:  
• Hox clusters (hoxa1-13, hoxb1-10, hoxc3-13, hoxd3-12) and cofactors (pbx, meis, cdx), genes that pattern the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis.  
• Retinoic-acid metabolic genes (aldh1a2, dhrs3, cyp26 family members) and many nuclear-receptor targets.  
• Hundreds of broadly expressed, early neuro-ectodermal and mesodermal regulators (pax, fox, sox, irx, tal, gata etc.).

Taken together, the cluster matches classical retinoic-acid/Hox response elements that establish A-P positional identity and, later, sustain RA-dependent programmes in the eye.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene set)  
• Nuclear receptors: RAR (rarga/b), RXR (rxraa/b, rxrab), COUP-TF/NR2F1-6, PPAR (ppara/pparg), Rev-erb/NR1D and ROR family – all canonical RA or lipid-sensing receptors.  
• Hox + TALE cofactors: Hoxa/b/c/d proteins together with Pbx1-4 and Meis1-3 motifs.  
• Cdx, Pax (Pax6/7/2), and Irx motifs – consistent with regionalisation of neural tube and eye.  
• Fox and Sox families – early open chromatin in pluripotent ectoderm/mesoderm.  
The presence of E2F/MEF2/TEAD motifs at lower scores fits their role in maintaining high accessibility of proliferative, housekeeping promoters that accompany the developmental programme.

In summary, cluster 26_7 demarcates a genome-wide RA/Hox regulatory module that is opened during gastrulation, patterns multiple germ layers along the A-P axis, and remains especially active in the optic cup where RA signalling stays elevated during early organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 26_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 26_8 corresponds to a neural-midline / early-neurogenesis regulatory program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at 0–5-somite stages and rises steadily thereafter, reaching its maximum at 20–30 somites (≈19-24 hpf).  
   • The progressive increase suggests these elements become engaged during transition from late segmentation to early organogenesis, when neural-tube patterning and first neurons/floor-plate derivatives mature.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Ventral neural tube and midline derivatives:  
     – Floor-plate cells (highest values; e.g. 30 somites ≈206)  
     – Neural floor-plate & spinal-cord progenitors  
   • Adjacent neural territories: hindbrain, midbrain-hindbrain boundary, differentiating neurons.  
   • Notochord and posterior paraxial mesoderm show secondary enrichment, consistent with their role in Shh signalling to the floor plate.  
   • Most non-neural lineages display only baseline accessibility.

3. Implied regulatory/biological processes  
   • Ventralisation and patterning of the neural tube driven by Hedgehog signalling (presence of gli1/2/3, hhip, ptch2).  
   • Floor-plate specification (foxa/foxa2, nkx2.2a, nkx6.2, nkx2.4, nkx6.1) and motor-/inter-neuron progenitor formation (olig2, pax6, pax7, lhx genes).  
   • Anterior-posterior neural identity via Hox/Pbx clusters.  
   • Retinoic-acid and Wnt modulators (many RAR/RXR/NR2F genes, wnt1/3a/8) indicate integration of RA & Wnt gradients with Shh.  
   • Axon guidance / early neuronal differentiation genes (robo1/2, sema, eph/ephrin, slit) are co-accessible, pointing to the onset of neural-circuit assembly.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene set)  
   • Fox family – especially FoxA2/FoxA (founder of floor-plate fate) and FoxD/FoxJ; strong FOX motifs.  
   • Gli1/2/3 – canonical effectors of Shh; GLI motif set enriched.  
   • Nkx homeodomain factors (Nkx2.2, Nkx6.1/6.2, Nkx2.4/2.5) – ventral neural-tube patterning.  
   • SoxB (Sox2/3/19) – neural progenitor competence; Sox11/21 during neuronal differentiation.  
   • Pax6/7 & Hox/Pbx combos – integrate AP identity with ventral patterning.  
   • Nuclear-receptor motifs (RAR/RXR, COUP-TF/NR2F) – retinoic-acid responsiveness that modulates Shh/Hox axes.

Together, cluster 26_8 marks cis-regulatory elements that become progressively open in ventral neural-tube and floor-plate lineages, orchestrating Shh-FoxA/Nkx-driven patterning and the first wave of neuronal differentiation in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 26_9

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 26_9 corresponds to a retina/optic-cup regulatory module that switches on soon after gastrulation and remains highly accessible through early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already very high at 0–5 somites (10–12 hpf; optic_cup 0 som: 129) and peaks at ~10 somites (14 hpf; 134).  
   • It gradually declines but stays above background through 30 somites (24 hpf; 128).  
   ⇒ The elements are maximally active during eye-field specification and optic-cup evagination, then remain open while early retinal neurogenesis starts.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Strongest signal: optic-cup/eye field across all sampled stages (top scores in the entire matrix).  
   • Secondary, moderate signal: midbrain–hindbrain boundary, hindbrain, hemangioblasts and heart—tissues that transiently share eye-field TFs (Pax6, Otx2) or need common forebrain enhancers.  
   • Low-to-average accessibility in mesoderm, epidermis, endoderm, muscle and trunk neural crest.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Gene list is heavily enriched for eye-field / early-retina factors and photoreceptor determinants:  
   – Patterning/homeobox: pax6a/b, rx1/2/3, otx2a/b, vsx2, six3/6/7, lhx2/9, crx, onecut1/2/3, pbx/meis, hox-free forebrain markers (bsx, foxg1).  
   – Photoreceptor/neuronal differentiation: atoh7, neurod1/4, rorb, nr2e3, rax, isl2, pou4f1.  
   – Signalling & morphogenesis: fgf8a/3, wnt1, shh pathway modulators (foxd3, gli3), cell-adhesion (cadm4, ncam), axon-guidance (robo1/3).  
   ⇒ Cluster 26_9 likely contains enhancers coordinating optic-cup morphogenesis, retinal progenitor maintenance and the earliest wave of neuronal/photoreceptor differentiation.

4. Key transcription factors driving the programme  
   Motif enrichment plus TF-gene presence point to:  
   • Pax6 (paired/homeobox) – master eye-field regulator.  
   • Rx (Rx1/2/3; RAX motif) – optic-cup specification.  
   • Otx2 / Crx – photoreceptor lineage initiation.  
   • Six3/6, Lhx2 – forebrain-retina competence factors.  
   • Vsx2 (Chx10) – retinal progenitor proliferation.  
   • Onecut family – horizontal/photoreceptor fate.  
   • Sox2/3/19 – pluripotency/neuronal competence co-factor.  
   • Nuclear receptors Rorb, Nr2e3 – rod/photoreceptor gene network.  
   • Mef2/CREB/ATF motifs are present but likely reflect general neuronal activity.

Summary: Peak-cluster 26_9 marks a set of cis-regulatory elements that become accessible in the eye field immediately after gastrulation, stay open in optic-cup epithelium and early retinal progenitors, and are controlled by the canonical eye-field/homeobox TF ensemble (Pax6, Rx, Six3, Otx2, Vsx2, Crx). These regions orchestrate optic-cup formation and the onset of retinal neurogenesis/photoreceptor differentiation.

## Cluster 26_10

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 26_10 captures a late-segmentation neural gene-regulatory program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is low at 0-5 somites (~10–12 hpf) and rises steadily, with a step-up after 15 somites (≈18 hpf).  
• Maximum openness is at 20–30 somites (22–24 hpf), the latest stage assayed.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest values)  
• Differentiating neurons / pan-neurons (20–30 somites)  
• Regional CNS domains – hindbrain, midbrain-hindbrain boundary, spinal cord, floor-plate, optic neuro-epithelium  
• Neural-crest-derived neurons and pharyngeal arches  
(Non-neural tissues show only moderate accessibility.)

3. Biological processes controlled  
The combination of accessible regions and correlated transcripts points to:  
a) Patterning of the posterior/mid neural tube and hindbrain (HOX, PBX/MEIS, GBX, EN, OTX factors)  
b) Neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation (SOX2/3/11, NEUROD/ASCL, MYT1, BHLH factors)  
c) Dorsal–ventral identity and motor-neuron specification (PAX3/7, LHX, NKX, UNC-homeobox)  
d) Retinoic-acid–dependent axial patterning and maturation (RAR/RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR nuclear receptors)  
e) Cell-cycle exit of neural precursors (E2F family enrichment)  

Together these suggest the cluster harbours enhancers that switch on as neural progenitors leave the cell cycle and acquire region-specific neuronal identities along the hindbrain–spinal axis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
• HOX-PBX/MEIS code – positional identity along A-P axis  
• PAX family (Pax2/3/6/7/8) – boundary formation, neural crest & interneuron fates  
• SOX family (Sox2/3/11/14/21) – neural competence & differentiation  
• FOX family (FoxD3, FoxG1, FoxP1/4, FoxL1/FoxF2) – neural patterning & migration  
• LHX/ISL/UNC homeodomain factors – motor-neuron subtype specification  
• Nuclear receptors RAR/RXR/COUP-TF/ROR – retinoid signalling cue-integration  
• E2F1/2/3/4/5/7 – shutting down proliferation as differentiation proceeds  

In summary, cluster 26_10 marks late-acting enhancers that become open in multiple neuronal lineages during 18–24 hpf, integrating retinoic-acid and region-specific HOX/PAX/SOX/FOX inputs to drive hindbrain–spinal neuronal maturation.

## Cluster 26_11

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 26_11 represents a classic early hemato-vascular/endothelial regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises sharply between the 0–10-somite stages, is maximal at ~5–10 somites (≈11–14 hpf), and gradually declines by 20–30 somites (18–24 hpf).  
   • The pattern fits the time window when angioblasts/hemangioblasts are specified and the first endothelial cords and primitive blood cells emerge.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signal)  
   • Hemangioblasts ≫ Hematopoietic/vasculature progenitors ≫ Heart myocardium / Somites / Endoderm.  
   • Much lower in neural or epidermal compartments.  
   • Thus the peaks mark mesoderm-derived hemato-vascular progenitors with spill-over to related mesodermal tissues (heart, muscle) that share early endothelial programs.

3. Likely biological processes regulated  
   • Specification of hemangioblasts and endothelial progenitors.  
   • Onset of vasculogenesis/angiogenesis (kdrl/tek/egfl7, slit3, nrp1/2, plxna2).  
   • Early hematopoietic gene activation (tal1, lmo2, gata2a, runx1t1, gfi1aa).  
   • Endoderm/vascular cross-talk (fgf24, gata5, hhex, rfx6) consistent with endodermal support of vasculature and pancreatic endocrine priming.  
   • SMAD and MAPK-related genes (smad5, dusp5/6) suggest integration of BMP/Fgf signalling typical of hemato-vascular induction.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + expressed genes)  
   • ETS family: Fli1, Ets1, Erg – core endothelial activators.  
   • GATA factors: Gata2/5/6 – required for both endothelium and blood progenitors.  
   • TAL1 (Scl)–LMO2 complex – hallmark of hemangioblast/hematopoietic fate.  
   • SOX7 / SOX18 (and SOX17) – arterial/venous endothelial identity genes.  
   • NPAS4L (Cloche) – zebrafish-specific master of hemato-vascular specification (gene present).  
   • RUNX1/3 – earliest hematopoietic commitment.  
   • Nuclear receptors COUP-TF (Nr2f1/2) & RAR/RXR – known modulators of vascular patterning.  
   • RFX6 – links to pancreatic/endoderm enhancers seen in the cluster.

Together, cluster 26_11 captures enhancers that switch on during segmentation to drive the emergence of endothelial and blood lineages and the early vascular network, under a TF ensemble dominated by ETS-GATA-TAL1/LMO2-SOX factors.

## Cluster 26_12

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 26_12 corresponds to a large set of promoter-like regions that remain open in virtually every cell we profiled.  It carries the chromatin signature of “house-keeping / proliferation” genes rather than lineage-restricted enhancers.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at the earliest stage we measured (0-somite, 10 hpf) and remains high throughout somitogenesis.  
   • The median signal drifts only modestly (≤ 10–15 %) across time; if anything, it is slightly higher in very early (0-10 som) than late (20-30 som) samples, indicating a mild attenuation as global proliferation slows when organ rudiments start to differentiate.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Values are uniformly high across virtually all 110 pseudobulk cell types.  
   • The very highest scores are seen in highly proliferative progenitor pools – neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), presomitic mesoderm (PSM), tail-bud, early spinal cord and early muscle – but differences are small (< 15 %).  
   • No single lineage shows exclusive enrichment; the cluster is therefore interpreted as “ubiquitous”.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Associated gene list is dominated by:  
     – Core cell-cycle regulators (E2F targets, MCMs, CDK-cyclins, PCNA, AURKB, etc.)  
     – Basal transcription/translation machinery (POL II subunits, ribosomal proteins, spliceosome factors).  
     – Mitochondrial and general metabolic enzymes.  
   • Together with the temporal/cell-type pattern, this points to a programme that underpins generic growth, DNA replication, RNA/protein synthesis and energy production required in all dividing embryonic cells.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment highlights TF families that control universal growth and metabolic programmes:  
   • E2F1/2/3/4/5/7 (cell-cycle entry and S-phase genes).  
   • FOXM1 / FOXK / FOXO – general proliferation and metabolic control at CpG-rich promoters.  
   • KLF/Sp and NF-Y (broad promoter activators at GC-rich, CpG-island promoters).  
   • MYC/MAX-like bHLH factors (broad growth signalling; motifs captured as BHLHE40/41, USF/ATF).  
   • Nuclear receptor “orphan” factors (NR2F, ROR, RXR) that frequently bind generic promoter DR-elements.  
   • CXXC-domain chromatin readers (KDM2B/CXXC1) – consistent with ubiquitous, CpG-island promoters.

In summary, peak-cluster 26_12 represents a constitutive, promoter-heavy regulatory module that keeps housekeeping/proliferation genes accessible across all stages and cell types during zebrafish gastrulation–organogenesis, driven by a canonical growth/cell-cycle TF cadre (E2Fs, FOXM1/K, KLF/Sp, NRF/NR2F/ROR).

## Cluster 27_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 27_0 captures a “posterior–myotome” chromatin programme that is first turned on in the tail-bud at the onset of somitogenesis and is reused later in differentiating trunk muscle.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Very sharp peak at 0-somite / tail-bud stage (10 hpf) – tail_bud_0somites accessibility ≈ 40 (＞3-fold above any other early tissue).  
• Moderate accessibility throughout the 5- to 20-somite window in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP) and presomitic mesoderm (PSM).  
• A second, late surge in the fully formed myotome at 30 somites / 24 hpf – muscle_30somites accessibility ≈ 57.  
→ “Bimodal” use: early during axis elongation, late during skeletal-muscle maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signal)  
• Early: Tail-bud (neuromesoderm) ≫ NMP > PSM.  
• Late: Bulk trunk muscle (especially the generic “muscle”, then fast-muscle) ≫ other tissues.  
• Only basal (~8-11) signals in neural, endodermal or epidermal clusters.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Associated genes and GO terms point to posterior patterning and myofibre morphogenesis.  
• Axis‐elongation / tail-bud genes: cyp26a1 (retinoic-acid sink), boc (Hh co-receptor), foxn3, qki2.  
• Somite / myotome morphogenesis & cytoskeleton: fhod1/fhod3b (actin assembly), myo6a, fxyd6l, cacnb1.  
• Axon-guidance & neuromuscular wiring: efna5a, ncam1a, ntrk2a, tenm4, slc1a2b.  
Together these suggest the cluster regulates posterior trunk specification, then the structural and innervation programmes of maturing skeletal muscle.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (highest motif Z-scores & motif families enriched)  
• Posterior HOX paralogs (Hox9-13) with PBX/MEIS cofactors – hallmark of trunk/tail identity.  
• FOX factors (FoxC/D/F/L family) – mesodermal and myogenic enhancers.  
• PAX3/7 & TBX1/15/18 – early dermomyotome / myotome regulators.  
• MEF2 and myogenic bHLH (Myod/Myf5 motifs appear, though genes not on the list) – late muscle differentiation wave.  
• E2F cell-cycle motifs – consistent with highly proliferative tail-bud NMP population at 0-somites.

In summary, peak-cluster 27_0 represents regulatory elements that open first in proliferative posterior stem/mesoderm cells to build the body axis, then reopen in differentiated trunk muscle to drive myofibre maturation and neuromuscular connectivity, orchestrated by HOX-FOX-PAX/TBX and MEF2/myogenic TF modules.
]

## Cluster 27_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 27_1 corresponds to a set of regulatory regions that are used widely during somitogenesis but become maximally accessible in two discrete developmental settings.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Detectable from the earliest stage we profiled (~10 hpf; “0 somites”) and stays open throughout somitogenesis.  
   • Two accessibility maxima are evident:  
     – Early spike at 0 somites in the mid-brain / hind-brain boundary (38.7 a.u.).  
     – Major late peak at 30 somites (~24 hpf) in differentiated trunk muscle (fast-muscle & pan-muscle, 52 a.u.) and, to a lesser extent, in mature somites.  

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Skeletal‐muscle lineage – fast muscle, generic “muscle”, mature somites.  
   • Neuro-epithelial border cells – midbrain-hindbrain boundary at 0–10 somites.  
   • Moderate but uniform accessibility (≈6–8 a.u.) in most other lineages suggests housekeeping usage, yet the clear over-representation in the two cell types above defines the cluster.

3. Likely biological programme  
   Associated genes are strongly enriched for:  
   • Sarcomere and cytoskeleton assembly (tnnt3a, myh14, myo16, pdlim7, mylk4a).  
   • Extracellular-matrix / basement-membrane components and remodelers (lamc3, col5a3a, hmcn2, mmp2, loxl3b).  
   • Cell-adhesion / axon-guidance molecules (unc5da, fat3a, tenm2, gripap1, nrxn3a, panx3).  
   • Nuclear-receptor signalling & metabolic regulators (RAR/RXR/PPAR family genes).  
   These functions fit the needs of (i) establishing the neuro-epithelial boundary early and (ii) building contractile muscle fibres and their attachments later.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment points to four cooperating TF modules.  
   • Myogenic module – MEF2 (mef2cb, mef2ca, mef2d), SRF, TEAD1; governs sarcomere and cytoskeletal genes.  
   • Nuclear-receptor module – RAR/RXR, NR2F (Coup-TF), NR5A, NR4A; integrates retinoid & metabolic cues during tissue maturation.  
   • SOX / FOX border-epithelium module – SOX2/3/4/10/14 and FOX family factors (FOXC/F/O); active in the early midbrain-hindbrain boundary.  
   • Cell-cycle / growth module – E2F (E2F1/2/3/4/5/7) and FOXM1, marking regions that remain accessible in proliferating progenitors.  

In summary, peak-cluster 27_1 marks a transcriptional programme first used to set up the midbrain–hindbrain boundary and later reused, at much higher intensity, to drive terminal differentiation of skeletal muscle, orchestrated by MEF2/SRF-dependent myogenic enhancers working in concert with nuclear-receptor and SOX/FOX regulators.
]

## Cluster 27_2

[*assistant*:
Peak Cluster 27_2 – concise biological summary  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Earliest strong opening: 0–5-somite stage (≈10–12 hpf) – especially in optic-cup progenitors (optic_cup_0 = 37.7; 5 = 6.1).  
• Moderate, broad accessibility is maintained through mid-segmentation (10–20 somites) in neural progenitors and differentiating neurons.  
• A second, late spike at 30 somites (≈24 hpf) is seen in the pan-muscle pseudobulk (muscle_30 = 45.7) while most other lineages stay at baseline (~3–4).  
Interpretation: the elements open very early in the eye/neuro-epithelium, stay accessible in neurogenic populations, and are re-used (or re-opened) during late myogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Optic cup / early eye field  
• Neuro-epithelial progenitors, differentiating neurons, floor‐plate / mid-brain–hind-brain boundary  
• Late somitic skeletal muscle (secondary peak)  
Relative accessibility in most mesendodermal or endothelial compartments is low.

3. Likely regulatory programme  
GO/KEGG terms inferred from correlated genes (e.g. tenm3, nrxn2a, nlgn3a, nrg3b, cntnap2b, bcl11ab, lin28b, alcama) point to:  
• Neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation  
• Axon guidance / synaptogenesis  
• Early retinal specification and photoreceptor priming  
Secondary late involvement in skeletal-muscle maturation (consistent with mef2-family motif enrichment).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs strongly enriched + present in gene list)  
Eye / neuronal phase:  
   – Rx1/2/3, Vsx1, NR2E3 (photoreceptor/eye TF)  
   – Sox family (Sox2/4/11/21/19) – neural progenitors and early neurogenesis  
   – Lhx2/9, Pbx/Meis and other homeobox factors (optic-cup & forebrain)  
   – Fox (Foxd3/Foxg1/Foxi) – neuro-epithelial and neural-crest regulators  
Proliferative component: E2F1-3/7 motifs (matches kdm2b, dnmt1 etc. in gene set).  
Muscle re-use: MEF2 (mef2aa/ab/ca/cb/d) and SRF motifs become prominent in 30-somite muscle pseudobulk.

Overall interpretation  
Cluster 27_2 marks a cis-regulatory module set that is first deployed in the eye-field / anterior neuro-plate to drive neurogenic and retinal programmes, remains permissive in generic neural lineages, and is later re-engaged by the MEF2-centred network during terminal muscle differentiation.
]

## Cluster 27_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 27_3 corresponds to the core myogenic programme that turns paraxial mesoderm into differentiated trunk/fast muscle fibres.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises steadily from early somitogenesis and reaches a maximum at late-somite / early-organogenesis stages.  
   • Numbers illustrate the trend: muscle pseudobulks (log-CPM) 5.5 → 6.5 → 7.0 → 49.6 (0 → 30 somites); fast-muscle 4.8 → 6.1 → 6.9 → 8.9.  
   • Thus the cluster is most active between ~20–30 somites (≈ 22–24 hpf) when myotome maturation and fibre growth accelerate.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in the myogenic lineage:  
   • “muscle”, “fast muscle”, “somites” pseudobulks.  
   • Moderate opening in immediate precursors (paraxial mesoderm / PSM) and neuromesodermal progenitors, but low in non-mesodermal tissues.  
   This pattern fits the transition from PSM → myotome → mature skeletal muscle.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Gene set is enriched for proteins required for skeletal-muscle structure and function:  
   • Sarcomere/excitation-contraction – stac3, klhl31, capzb, capn1/12, syne1b, vclb, add1, tns1a, atp2a3.  
   • Membrane transport & metabolism – slc25a22a/25a25a, atp8a1, adcy6a, prep, ubap2b.  
   • ECM / myotome morphogenesis – fbn2b, nid1a, col4a2, col5a1.  
   Collectively the peaks mark enhancers/promoters that drive myofibril assembly, fibre elongation and the metabolic switch of differentiating fast fibres.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and motif-to-factor mapping point to the canonical myogenic cascade:  
   • Myogenic Regulatory Factors (MRFs): MYOD1, MYF5, MYF6, MYOG – bHLH motifs highly enriched (cluster rows 41/42).  
   • MEF2 family (MEF2A/B/C/D) – required for late differentiation and sarcomere gene activation (row 10).  
   • SRF/TEAD & SRF-cofactors – support actin-cytoskeleton and muscle-specific cytoskeletal genes.  
   • E-proteins/TCF3/12 and E2F factors – reflect proliferative myoblast stages preceding terminal differentiation.  
   • Minor contributors: FOXO/Foxo1, FOXK, Sox6 (fast-fibre repressor of slow genes) and NR2F nuclear receptors, consistent with metabolic maturation.

In summary, peak-cluster 27_3 captures the enhancer set that switches on and maintains skeletal-muscle differentiation, peaking in fast-muscle fibres at late somite stages under the control of MRF-MEF2-SRF centred transcriptional circuitry.
]

## Cluster 27_4

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 27_4 captures a two-phase regulatory module that is primarily neuro‐ectodermal (mid-brain/hind-brain boundary) in the early segmentation stages and is reutilised in a subset of differentiating trunk muscle cells late in somitogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Strongest accessibility at 10 hpf (0-somite stage) with a gradual decline through 5–20 somites.  
• A second, late spike at 24 hpf (30 somites) confined almost exclusively to the “muscle_30somites” pseudobulk.  
→ Interpretation: an early wave linked to mid-brain/hind-brain patterning, followed by re-deployment of a subset of the elements during terminal skeletal-muscle maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signal in:  
• Midbrain–hindbrain boundary cells (38-fold above background at 0 somites; still elevated at 15 somites).  
• Minor but sharp enrichment in mature trunk/fast-muscle nuclei at 30 somites (≈47-fold).  
Moderate accessibility (2–3-fold) is seen in generic neural plate / spinal cord pseudobulks, matching widespread low-level chromatin opening in the neural tube.

3. Likely biological programme  
Associated gene list is heavily enriched for:  
• Midbrain/forebrain axon-guidance and synaptic genes (GRIK2, GRM7, TENM2, SORCS3, ANK2, NECAB1/2, CELF6, IGLON5).  
• Extracellular-matrix/adhesion molecules characteristic of the isthmic organiser (TNC, FRAS1, HSPG2, FREM2A).  
• A smaller set of sarcomeric / membrane-stability genes expressed during late myofibre differentiation (FHOD3B, SGCD, SVIL, FHOD3B, SGCD).  
Gene ontology therefore points to (i) isthmic organiser formation, neuronal adhesion and early circuit assembly, and (ii) late myofibre structural maturation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment plus TF–motif mapping highlight two coherent TF batteries.  
Early MHB stage  
• Otx2/Gbx2 antagonistic pair (supported by strong Pbx/Meis, En1/2, Pax2/5/8, Lhx2/9 and Hox class I motifs) – classical regulators of the isthmic organiser.  
• Sox (Sox2/3/19b) and Fox (Foxa/Foxd/Foxg) motifs – maintaining neural progenitor identity and regional competence.  
Late muscle stage  
• Myogenic bHLH and Mef2 (Myod1, Myf5, Mef2a/c/d) together with Tbx4/5/15/18 and Tead/Tead1-3 motifs – hallmarks of terminal fast-muscle differentiation.

Overall interpretation  
Cluster 27_4 comprises cis-regulatory elements first opened in the isthmic organiser to drive regional‐patterning and axon-guidance genes, and later re-used by the myogenic programme to reinforce structural/adhesion gene expression in maturing fast muscle fibres.
]

## Cluster 27_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 27_5 marks a set of cis-elements that switch on during early segmentation and remain accessible through the first day of organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility appears already at the 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf) in optic-cup cells and rises sharply from 5 somites onward in the musculature, reaching its maximum at 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • Thus, the cluster is most active during the 5- to 30-somite window, i.e. mid-to-late segmentation through early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest chromatin openness is seen in:  
   • Fast-skeletal muscle / generic muscle pseudobulks (fast_muscle 5–30 som, muscle 0–30 som; log-accessibility ≈ 6–7, spike to > 47 at 30 som)  
   • Optic-cup/retinal progenitors (optic_cup 0–20 som; log-accessibility ≈ 7, extreme 38 at 0 som)  
   Moderate signals are present in other somitic derivatives (somites, PSM) and neural crest. Overall, the pattern is “muscle + early eye”.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   Associated gene set is enriched for:  
   • Myogenic differentiation and sarcomere genes – myog, mef2aa, myf5/6, tpm4b, kdm6ba, plxna1a, etc.  
   • Retinal/optic-stalk specification genes – vax2, pax6-like (pax family present in motif map), vsx / Six / Lhx family members.  
   • General cytoskeleton, calcium handling and metabolic genes (acsl5, atp2a2b, itpr1a), consistent with maturation of contracting muscle and photoreceptor metabolism.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
   Motif enrichment and mapping point to two TF modules:  
   • Myogenic module – Myod1, Myf5/6, Myogenin (bHLH), together with MEF2 (mef2aa/b/ca/cb/d) and SRF. These factors explain the strong, sustained accessibility in fast-skeletal muscle.  
   • Eye/retina module – Pax6/7, Vax2, Vsx1, Six3/6, Rx, Lhx2/9; their motifs are highly represented in the optic-cup-biased peaks.  
   Supporting factors include Ets (Etv/Fli), Sox (Sox3/4/8/9), and Zic, which cooperate in both myogenic and retinal enhancers.

In summary, cluster 27_5 delineates a bifunctional enhancer set that is first employed in optic-cup neuroectoderm and then reused or newly opened in paraxial-mesoderm-derived fast muscle, orchestrated by canonical myogenic TFs and eye-field homeobox proteins.
]

## Cluster 28_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 28_0 represents a large collection of regulatory elements that turn on as embryonic neurons are born and mature.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already above background at 10 hpf (0-somite) but rises steeply with every subsequent stage, reaching its maximum at 24 hpf (≈30-somites).  
   • The monotonic increase (e.g. enteric-neurons: 13 → 61; differentiating-neurons: 9 → 36) indicates that the loci are associated with late neurogenesis / early synaptogenesis rather than very early neural induction.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in:  
   • Differentiating CNS neurons (brain, spinal cord).  
   • Enteric / autonomic neurons derived from neural-crest.  
   • More modest but clear signal in generic “neurons”, hind-/mid-brain, spinal-cord and neural-crest clusters.  
   Mesoderm, endoderm, epidermis, muscle, endoderm-derived organs, etc. remain at housekeeping-like baseline (~4), confirming neuron-selectivity.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   Associated genes are strongly enriched for neuronal maturation functions:  
   • Synaptic vesicle cycle & neurotransmitter release – SNAP25, SYT1/11/13, SV2, RIMS2/3, CPLX2, STXBP1, DNM1, BSN/Bsnb.  
   • Axon guidance / adhesion – NRXN1/2/3, CNTN2/4/5, LRRTM4, DCC, ROBO1/3, TENM2/4, DOCK3/4, L1CAM-family, KIRREL3.  
   • Ion-channels & excitability – SCN8A/B, CACNA1A/B/G, KCNQ5, KCNB2, GRIA / GRID / GRIN glutamate receptors, GABBR, SLC17A6, SLC5A7.  
   • Neuro-peptide / neuro-hormone genes – BDNF, VGF, PNOC, ADCYAP1.  
   Collectively these point to terminal neuronal differentiation, axon outgrowth and the assembly of functional synapses, with a particular bias toward projecting and enteric-autonomic neurons.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene set)  
   • Pan-neuronal bHLH factors: NEUROD1/4, ASCL1, NEUROG/ATOH family (strong bHLH motif scores; their genes are present).  
   • SOX family (SOX11/4/6/14/21) – high SOX-motif Z-scores; known to promote neuronal outgrowth/maturation.  
   • Homeobox patterning factors – LHX2/9, PHOX2A/B, TLX3, HOX/MEIS/PBX groups – provide axial/ subtype identity (motif clusters for HOX, MEIS, PBX highly enriched).  
   • FOX/POU/BRN factors (FOXG1, FOXP1/2, POU4-class) – motifs with high enrichment; control cortical / autonomic neuron programmes.  
   • MEF2 family – activity-dependent synaptic regulators; MEF2 motifs (~0.6–1.0 Z) enriched and mef2 genes expressed.  
   • RAR/RXR/NR2F nuclear-receptor motifs – consistent with a retinoid-responsive phase of neuronal maturation.  
   • Minor contributions from E2F/TCF motifs early on, likely reflecting the proliferative–to-post-mitotic transition.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 28_0 marks enhancers and promoters that are progressively activated between 10 and 24 hpf in differentiating neuronal lineages—especially enteric and broad CNS neurons—driving axonogenesis, synapse assembly and functional maturation. The regulatory logic is built around pan-neuronal bHLH and SOX proteins, refined by region-/subtype-specific HOX/LHX/PHOX2 and modulated by activity-dependent MEF2 and retinoid receptors.

## Cluster 28_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 28_1 marks a neuronal-specific regulatory program that switches on during somitogenesis and reaches full activity by the end of early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Low/basal accessibility at gastrulation/0-som (10 hpf).  
   • Steady rise during segmentation; sharp jump after 15-som (≈19 hpf).  
   • Maximum at 30-som (≈24 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest signals are in neural lineages, with a clear hierarchy:  
   • Enteric neurons ≫ differentiating neurons/“generic” neurons ≫ hindbrain & spinal-cord neurons.  
   Mesoderm, endoderm, epidermis and muscle remain at basal background.

3. Biological processes controlled  
   Associated gene set is packed with late-neuronal differentiation and wiring factors:  
   – Axon guidance / neurite outgrowth: CNTN4/5, CNTNAP2, TENM1/2, DSCAM/L, L1-family, SEMA3C, NRG3, SATB2.  
   – Synaptic and ion-channel genes: CACNA1 family, SCN8A, KCNQ2, GABBR1, SLC17A6/7, SV2A, SYT14, ANO family.  
   – Cytoskeleton & signaling: MAPK10, MAP3K13, TRIM67, ABLIM1, PRKCA/PRKCG.  
   – Enteric/crest lineage markers (PHOX2-, LMX/LHX, RET pathway co-factors).  
   Together these peaks mark transcriptional programs for terminal differentiation, axon extension and synapse formation of neural-crest-derived enteric neurons and CNS interneurons.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
   • Sox family (Sox10, Sox5/21/2) – neural-crest competence and early neurogenesis.  
   • Phox2a/Phox2b – hallmark TFs for enteric and autonomic neuron maturation.  
   • PBX/MEIS & HOX homeodomain factors – rostro-caudal/hindbrain patterning and neuron subtype identity.  
   • LHX/LMX & DLX pairs – interneuron specification, axon pathfinding.  
   • FOX (FoxD3/Foxp/Foxg) and E2F/MEF2 secondary motifs – supporting chromatin opening and activity-dependent remodeling.

In sum, cluster 28_1 delineates the enhancer set that is progressively activated in late-somite neural-crest derivatives, especially enteric neurons, to drive their final differentiation and circuitry assembly during 20-24 hpf.
]

## Cluster 28_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 28_2 – concise biological interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is detectable from early segmentation (0–5 som) but rises steadily through somitogenesis and culminates at 30 som (~24 hpf).  
• The sharp late-stage jump (e.g. Enteric_neurons 30 som ≈ 74 vs ≈ 28 at 10 som) indicates that the cis-elements in this cluster become fully active during early organogenesis, after the major neural-crest migrations have finished and neurons begin terminal differentiation / circuit formation.  

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Enteric‐neuron lineage – by far the strongest signal (all somite stages, peak at 30 som).  
• Other differentiating neuronal populations (spinal cord “neurons”, generic “neural” and “differentiating_neurons” bins) show intermediate activity.  
• Mesodermal progenitors (NMP, PSM) register modest accessibility early, but drop off later, indicating these enhancers turn over from a broad posterior–trunk domain to a neural-crest/neurogenic-specific program.  

3. Likely regulatory programme / biology  
Gene set is highly enriched for:  
• Neuronal wiring & synaptogenesis – adhesion/axon-guidance receptors and scaffolds (CNTNAP2, CTNND2, GRID1, GRIN2C/2D, NRXN-related, ROBO1, TENM2, NAV3, EFNA3, GABBR1, NPAS3, SYNCRIP, STX1B, SYT14, TANC1, CAMK2B, PAK1).  
• Enteric/visceral neuron differentiation – PHOX2-/GATA-dependent signalling (GFRA4a, GALR2b, NOS1, RALGPS1, RET‐pathway partner genes).  
• Extracellular-matrix & motility (AGRIN, ADAMTS17, MMP16, COL11A1, HMCN2) fitting the extensive migration and axon extension of enteric neurons.  
• FGF/Wnt modulators (FGF5, FGFRL1b, Wnt5b, Rspo1) that pattern posterior gut and ENS precursors.  
Together these suggest that cluster 28_2 marks late neural-crest-derived enteric neurons as they exit the cell cycle, extend neurites and assemble gut circuits.  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & gene-list concordance)  
Top enriched motif families map to classic ENS / trunk neurogenic regulators:  
• HOX-PBX-MEIS code – strong HOX, PBX1/3/4, MEIS1/2/3, PKNOX motifs; fits rostro-caudal identity of trunk and gut neurons.  
• PHOX2 (phox2a / phox2ba / phox2bb) and DLX/LMX homeodomain motifs – master regulators of autonomic and enteric neuron fate.  
• SOX10 / SOX4/11/21 – maintain neural-crest identity and activate neurogenic genes.  
• GATA2/3 and E-box (NEUROD/OLIG/TCF-12) – cooperate in terminal differentiation and neurotransmitter specification.  
• RFX & NF-κB-related (RFX1-6, REL family) – associated with ciliogenesis/axon extension and late neuronal maturation.  

Summary  
Cluster 28_2 represents a set of enhancers that switch on late in somitogenesis in neural-crest derivatives, with specificity for the emerging enteric nervous system.  They are driven by a HOX-/PBX-MEIS positional code layered with PHOX2, SOX10, GATA2/3 and neurogenic bHLH factors to orchestrate neurite outgrowth, synapse assembly and functional maturation of enteric neurons.

## Cluster 28_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 28_3 captures a late-acting, neurogenic chromatin programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility climbs steadily from the first segmentation stage (0-somite, ≈10 hpf) and reaches a maximum at 20–30 somite stages (≈18–24 hpf).  
• The monotonic rise in differentiating-neuron and enteric-neuron pseudobulks (8 → 24 and 28 → 79 log-norm units, respectively) indicates that the elements open during neuronal maturation and early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is seen in neural crest-derived and hindbrain lineages:  
• Enteric neurons ≫ all other cell types (peak ≈ 79).  
• Differentiating neurons, neural crest, hindbrain and posterior neural plate show strong signals (15-24).  
• Non-neural mesoderm/endoderm remain at baseline (≈6-8).  
Thus the cluster is specific for developing central and peripheral neurons, with a pronounced bias toward the enteric nervous system.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Associated gene set is enriched for neuronal differentiation, axon guidance and synaptic maturation genes:  
  – Adhesion/axon guidance: DSCAM/L, CDH4/18, PLEXIN-A2/4, NRP1a, NGFR(a/b).  
  – Neuronal excitability: CACNA1 (α subunits), KCN* channels, SV2a.  
  – RNA-binding/neuronal splicing: RBFOX1/3, ELAVL4.  
  – Neurogenic TFs: NPAS3, MEF2aa/b/d, KLF7a, TCF12.  
Together with very high activity in enteric neurons, this points to regulation of late neurogenesis, neural-crest differentiation into the ENS, and hindbrain positional identity.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment and mapping point to a MEIS/PKNOX-HOX centred code, supplemented by neural-crest TFs:  
  • MEIS1/2 & PKNOX1/2 (Prep) – top motif group (row 28), recruit HOX partners to specify rhombomere and vagal-crest identity.  
  • HOX paralogs (esp. HOXB and HOXC classes) – patterning along the AP axis.  
  • SOX10/21 and PHOX2A/B – canonical regulators of neural-crest-to-enteric neuron transition.  
  • MEF2 family – maturation of post-mitotic neurons.  
  • NPAS3 / RORA – activity-dependent neuronal genes.

In summary, peak-cluster 28_3 marks enhancers that switch on during 18–24 hpf to drive HOX-/MEIS-directed patterning and SOX10-/PHOX2-driven differentiation of neural-crest cells into hindbrain and enteric neurons, supporting late neuronal maturation and circuitry assembly.
]

## Cluster 28_4

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 28_4 marks a late-acting, neuro-vascular regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises steadily from the earliest sample (0-som) and reaches a clear maximum at 20- to 30-somite stages (≈18–24 hpf).  
   • Virtually every “late” pseudobulk column is higher than its early counterpart, indicating activation during early organogenesis rather than during gastrulation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Enteric neurons – dramatic jump from 6.9 (0-som) to 73.3 (30-som) – the most enriched cell type.  
   • Hemangioblast / haemato-vascular endothelium – 12.3 → 24.1.  
   • Differentiating neurons (CNS) – 5.5 → 13.8.  
   • Secondary but appreciable signal in NMP/PSM and neural crest derived populations.  
   → The pattern fits derivatives of neural crest (enteric neurons) and mesodermal endothelial precursors that both emerge after mid-somitogenesis.

3. Underlying biological programme  
   Associated gene set is enriched for:  
   • Neuronal differentiation / synaptogenesis (NTRK2a, RAPGEF4, ADCY8, CAMK2G2, CACNA2D1/4, GRIK5, GABBR2, CNTN4, NCAM2, NRN1b, SEMA4F).  
   • Axon guidance and neurite outgrowth (PTBP3, DCLK1, FLNA, ABLIM3, MYO9A/10).  
   • Vascular / angiogenic regulators (EGFL7, FGD5a, FLI1a, ITGA8, EMP1, GALK, RASSF5).  
   → Taken together, peaks likely belong to enhancers that switch on terminal maturation programmes in peripheral/enteric neurons while simultaneously supporting endothelial morphogenesis—both tissues that undergo rapid outgrowth and wiring around 20–24 hpf.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & mapping)  
   • SOX family (Sox10/5/11/21/3) – canonical for neural-crest-derived enteric neuron specification.  
   • ETS factors (Fli1a, Etv2/4/5, Erg) – core endothelial/haemangioblast regulators.  
   • FOX factors (Foxd3, Foxi3, Foxg1, FoxP family) – cooperate with SOX in neural crest and with ETS in vasculature.  
   • PHOX2 (Phox2a/b) and HAND2 – specialised regulators of enteric neuron lineage.  
   • GATA2/3/6 & TAL1 – support vascular gene set (present in motif list).  
   • NFAT/MEF2/RUNX motifs appear, consistent with activity-dependent neuronal maturation and endothelial remodelling.  

In summary, cluster 28_4 identifies late-somite enhancers that are most active in enteric neurons and haemangioblast‐derived endothelium, orchestrating neurogenic and angiogenic maturation through a SOX/PHOX2/FOX-centred neural-crest module and an ETS/GATA/TAL1-centred endothelial module.
]

## Cluster 28_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 28_5 captures a late-neurogenic regulatory program, most prominent in developing enteric neurons.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at ≈10 somites, increases by 15 somites and reaches its maximum at 20–30 somites (≈22-24 hpf).  
   • This timing matches the window when trunk neural-crest cells finish migration and commit to the enteric/visceral neuron fate and when differentiating CNS neurons begin synaptogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Enteric neurons ≫ differentiating neurons (spinal cord / hindbrain) ≈ neural-crest derivatives > generic neural tissue.  
   • Mesodermal, endodermal and epidermal pseudobulks remain low, indicating a neuron-restricted signature.

3. Inferred biological programme  
   • Associated-gene list is enriched for:  
     – Synaptic transmission and vesicle exocytosis (SNAP25b, SYT7, RIMS1/2, SV2, GRIA/GRIN/GRM receptors, SCN & KCN ion-channels).  
     – Axon guidance / adhesion (CNTN, NRXN, NLGN, PCDH, TENM, LAMA/LAMC, COLs).  
     – Neuropeptide / GPCR signalling (ERBB4, DRD2/4, P2RX3, RAMP1).  
   • Together these point to terminal differentiation, circuit assembly and functional maturation of peripheral and central neurons, particularly the enteric nervous system.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs enriched & present in gene list)  
   • Phox2 module – phox2a / phox2ba / phox2bb motifs; master regulators of enteric- and visceral-motor neurons.  
   • Sox10/SoxE & SoxB – maintain neural-crest identity and drive neurogenesis.  
   • Hox/Pbx/Meis combination – numerous HoxB/D and Pbx/Meis motifs indicate rostro-caudal patterning inputs that specify vagal/trunk crest derivatives.  
   • Lhx & Uncx – LIM-homeodomain factors important for neuronal subtype identity.  
   • Gata2/3 & Hand/Tcf12/Scrts (motif set 29) – regulators of autonomic neuron differentiation.  
   • Ets (Fli/Etv) and Runx – support axon outgrowth and synaptic gene expression.  

Taken together, cluster 28_5 marks enhancers that switch on late in development in neural-crest-derived enteric neurons (and related differentiating CNS neurons) to activate a gene battery required for synaptic maturation, neurotransmission and final neuronal identity, driven by a Phox2/Sox/Hox–Pbx/Meis centred transcriptional network.
]

## Cluster 28_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 28_6 represents a late-stage neurogenic program, most strongly linked to neural-crest–derived peripheral / enteric neurons and their differentiating neuronal progeny.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises steadily across the somite series and peaks at 20-30-somite stages (≈ 21-24 hpf).  
   • Early gastrula samples (0–5 somites) show only basal accessibility, indicating that these elements switch on during the transition to overt neurogenesis / organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signal)  
   • Enteric neurons ≫ differentiating neurons ≫ neural-crest cells (especially 20-30 somites).  
   • Moderate but rising signal in hindbrain, spinal cord and floor-plate; low in mesoderm, endoderm or epidermis.  
   • Pattern fits activation in migrating neural-crest cells that differentiate into peripheral (enteric) neurons and later into CNS neurons.

3. Likely biological processes controlled  
   Gene set is enriched for axon-guidance and synaptogenesis molecules (DSCAMa, ROBO1/3, EPHB2b, EFNA3b, SEMA4Ba/6E, NTNG1a, NGFRa, SYT1a, RIMS1b), neuronal cell-adhesion/recognition (TENM2, CSMD2, CTNND2a, LAMC3, PCDH7b, DCHS1a) and cytoskeletal / signalling genes (MAPK8IP3, PREX2, NCK1b).  
   → Collectively they mark:  
     · Neural-crest migration and peripheral ganglion formation  
     · Axon path-finding & target selection  
     · Onset of synaptic vesicle release machinery  
   Thus cluster 28_6 likely contains enhancers that drive the maturation of peripheral/enteric neurons and related cranial-neural-crest derivatives.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
   • SOX family: SOX10/9/5/11 – core regulators of neural-crest specification and neuronal differentiation.  
   • FOX family: FOXD3/FOXC1/FOXP1/4 – cooperate with SOX10 in neural-crest and peripheral-neuron gene activation.  
   • HOX–PBX/MEIS complex (HOX-Bs, MEIS1/2/3, PBX1–4, PKNOX) – rostro-caudal patterning of migrating crest cells and enteric neurons.  
   • LHX / LMX / DLX homeodomain factors – interneuron and cranial-nerve differentiation.  
   • PAX3/7 & IRX/PAX6 motifs – early neural-crest and neuroectoderm competence factors.  
   • Minor contributions from E2F & KDM2B motifs, suggesting concurrent cell-cycle exit / chromatin remodelling.

Together, these data point to peak-cluster 28_6 as a set of neuro-crest/neuron-specific regulatory elements that turn on in late somitogenesis to orchestrate axon-guidance and synaptic differentiation programs essential for peripheral and enteric nervous-system assembly.
]

## Cluster 28_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 28_7 marks a neuron-specific cis-regulatory program that comes on late and is maximally active in the forming enteric nervous system.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at 0–5 somites (10–12 hpf) and then rises steeply with each stage:  
     differentiating neurons 4.3 → 11.4; enteric neurons 6.2 → 69.5 (0 → 30 somites).  
   • The sharp surge between 20- and 30-somite stages (≈22–24 hpf) indicates activation during late neural crest differentiation and early organogenesis, when enteric neurons begin terminal maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   1. Enteric neurons ≫ all other lineages (dominant signal at every time-point, 70-fold above baseline at 30 somites).  
   2. Differentiating pan-neurons (CNS) – progressively increasing.  
   3. Hindbrain / spinal-cord neurons – moderate.  
   4. Non-neuronal tissues (somite, muscle, endoderm, epidermis, etc.) remain at background (~4–5).  

   → The cluster is essentially neuron-restricted and most prominent in the enteric (autonomic) branch.

3. Putative biological program  
   Associated gene set is highly enriched for:  
   • Neuronal specification & autonomic/enteric identity – phox2a/2b, phox2bb, lhx/lmx, uncx, runx, sox10/21, foxd3, pax3/7.  
   • Axonogenesis & path-finding – nrxn1/2, cntn1/3, robo1, slit1, plxna1/2, sema4, tenm, sdk, unc5a.  
   • Synaptic assembly / neurotransmission – snap25a, gabra/b, gabbr1/2, grid/grik, slc17a6 (vGlut2), slc6a1, cacna/kcnh channel genes.  
   • ENS-associated signalling – nrg1, ret-pathway partners (gfra-like), piezo2, ptpr family.  

   Altogether the cluster appears to regulate the transition of neural-crest-derived progenitors into mature, functionally wired enteric neurons and, to a weaker extent, other late-born CNS neurons.

4. Key transcription factors inferred from motif enrichment & gene presence  
   • PHOX2 family (Phox2a/Phox2b/Phox2bb) – canonical drivers of autonomic and enteric neuron fate; multiple high-Z PHOX/paired-like motifs.  
   • SOX family (Sox10, Sox4/5/11/21) – maintain neural-crest identity and initiate neuronal differentiation.  
   • LHX / LMX / UNC homeodomain factors – subtype specification and axon targeting.  
   • HOX paralogs (Hoxb1/3/5, Hoxc cluster) – rostro-caudal positional information of vagal neural crest contributing to ENS.  
   • FOX factors (Foxd3, Foxa/b/f) – early neural-crest maintenance, later neuronal subtype genes.  
   • ETS (Etv5/Erf/Elk/Fli) & RUNX (Runx1/2/3) – neuronal outgrowth and synaptic gene activation.  
   • E2F/MEF2 appear only modestly and likely reflect residual cycling neurons or activity-dependent maturation.

In summary, peak-cluster 28_7 demarcates enhancers that turn on late in development, are highly specific to the enteric-neuron lineage, and are controlled by the PHOX2–SOX10–LHX/HOX transcriptional circuit that drives final differentiation and wiring of autonomic/enteric neurons in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 28_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 28_8 – concise interpretation

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is low at gastrulation/0–5-somite stages and rises steadily through segmentation, reaching its maximum at 20- and especially 30-somite stages (~22–24 hpf).  
• The monotonic increase (e.g. PSM 30 s = 75, Enteric-neurons 30 s = 75) indicates a late organogenesis programme switched on after body-axis elongation is largely complete.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Enteric neural-crest–derived neurons (enteric_neurons 15–30 s; strongest signal).  
• Posterior paraxial mesoderm / presomitic mesoderm (PSM 20–30 s).  
• Differentiating trunk / spinal neurons and tail-bud mesoderm show moderate signal; most other lineages remain low.  
=> The peaks mark a shared transcriptional programme in posterior–trunk neuro-mesodermal derivatives.

3. Likely biological processes regulated  
Gene set points to maturation of posterior neurons and associated mesodermal tissues.  
• Neuronal excitability & synaptogenesis: snap25b, sv2ca, snap25b, adcy2b, camk1da, camk2g1, cacna2d1a, glra3, grid2.  
• Axon/neurite outgrowth & guidance: efnb3a, gfra1b, cdh23, prex1, rit1.  
• Extracellular matrix & migration: col8a2, cspg4, spock2.  
• Muscle / Ca2+ handling components shared with PSM (atp2a1, wnk4b).  
Together these genes fit a programme that endows late trunk structures (enteric nervous system, posterior spinal cord, forming somites) with posterior HOX identity and functional neuronal properties.

4. Key transcription factors inferred  
Motif enrichment is dominated by posterior-identity and neuro-mesodermal factors:  
• HOX–PBX–MEIS complex (many Hox9-13, pbx1/3/4 and meis1/2 motifs; highest Z-scores, e.g. M04453).  
• PKNOX/Prep1 co-factor (pknox1/2 motifs).  
• LHX/TLX and NKX homeodomain factors (lmx1, tlx3, nkx2/3/6) linked to visceral motor and enteric neuron fate.  
• SOX10/5/21 and FOX family (foxd3, foxf2, foxg1) motifs reflecting neural-crest and posterior mesoderm competence.  
• PAX3/7 and E2F motifs—respectively neural-crest lineage specification and late cell-cycle exit.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 28_8 defines late-somite enhancers bound by HOX-PBX-MEIS and associated homeodomain factors that confer posterior axial identity and drive the terminal differentiation of enteric/trunk neurons and adjacent paraxial mesoderm.
]

## Cluster 28_9

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 28_9 marks a late, neuron-biased regulatory program that turns on in posterior axial/crest-derived lineages.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is basal from gastrulation to ~10 somites, rises steadily after 15 somites and reaches a sharp maximum at 30 somites (≈22-24 hpf).  
   • This “late-on” profile suggests the regions are engaged during early organogenesis, when neurons are maturing and posterior body elongation is ending.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Neural-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs) – strongest signal at 30 somites.  
   • Tail-bud tissue (posterior tip).  
   • Enteric / peripheral neurons (progressive increase 5 → 30 somites).  
   • Moderate in differentiating trunk neurons; low in most non-neural tissues.

3. Likely biological programme  
   • Associated genes are enriched for synaptic vesicle release (RIMS2, CPLX2), axon/neurite outgrowth & adhesion (CNTN4, SDK1A, NCANB, CSMD2/3, PIEZO2, EFNA3A, DLL4), ion channels & neurotransmitter receptors (GABRA2A, GABBR2, GRM4, KCN family, DRD2B) and RA/Fgf signalling components (IGF1, DLL4, FG​F14).  
   • Together with the cell types, the cluster most plausibly controls late differentiation, wiring and functional maturation of posterior peripheral/enteric neurons and of progenitors that generate trunk neural derivatives.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
   Motif enrichment highlights four TF groups that fit the biology:  
   • HOX–PBX/MEIS axis (many posterior Hox motifs; MEIS/PBX/PKNOX motifs - highest Z-scores ≈0.6-0.75) – encodes positional identity of caudal/tail tissues.  
   • SOX neural-crest / neurogenic factors (SOX10, SOX5/8/9/21) – consistent with neural-crest-derived enteric neurons.  
   • FOX & PHOX2/UN​CX homeobox factors – active in NMPs and autonomic neurons.  
   • Retinoic-acid nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR/COUP-TF) – matches RA-responsive gene set (dll4, igf1, hox up-regulation).

Summary: Peak cluster 28_9 comprises regulatory elements that switch on during late somitogenesis in posterior axial progenitors and emergent enteric/peripheral neurons, orchestrated by HOX-PBX/MEIS positional cues, SOX/FOX neural-crest regulators and RA-responsive nuclear receptors to drive neuronal maturation and wiring in the tail/trunk region.

## Cluster 28_10

[*assistant*:
Biological annotation of Peak-cluster 28_10  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises monotonically across the 10 → 30-somite stages (≈10–24 hpf).  
• Signal roughly doubles between early somitogenesis (0–5 somites) and 15 somites and then shows a second sharp increase, peaking at 30 somites in almost every lineage.  
→ The elements in this cluster switch on during late somitogenesis and remain maximally open at the onset of organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest mean accessibility at 30 somites)  
• Enteric neurons >> all other populations (≈ 86 norm. counts)  
• Differentiating CNS neurons (brain & spinal cord), spinal-cord/neural tube, floor plate  
• Broad neuronal groups (neurons, neural_posterior, neural_telencephalon)  
• Secondary, moderate signal in nascent muscle and somite epithelium; low in mesendoderm/endothelial derivatives.  
→ Cluster 28_10 marks late neural derivatives, with a pronounced bias toward neural-crest-derived enteric neurons plus maturing CNS neurons.

3. Putative regulatory programme / biology  
Associated genes are heavily enriched for:  
• Axon guidance & neurite extension - robo4, ephb1, efna5a, unc5d, neo1a, tenm2/4, plxna1a  
• Synaptogenesis / neurotransmission - nrxn1/3, gria3b, grin2a/c, gabrb2, hcn1/4, cacna1ab/2d1/2d2, scn8ab, dlg1, elavl4, rbfox3

• Neural progenitor/early-differentiation markers - nes, pou3f1, sox4/11, myt1b, msi2a  

Functional theme: transition from neural-crest / neuro-epithelial progenitors to electrically active peripheral (enteric) and central neurons, including establishment of axon-guidance and synaptic machinery.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (top motif enrichments & mapping)  
• SOX family (Sox10, Sox4/11, Sox5/6/9) – neural-crest identity and neuronal differentiation  
• PHOX/HOX-MEIS-PBX code – anterior–posterior neuronal patterning and enteric-neuron specification  
• bHLH proneural factors (NEUROD1/4/6, ATOH1/7, OLIG2, ASCL1) – neurogenesis trigger  
• MEF2 & SRF – activity-dependent neuronal maturation  
• RFX and NF-Y – ciliogenesis and chromatin opening at late neuronal genes  
• NR/ORR family (Rora/b/c, Thrab, Esrr) – maturation & circadian / metabolic coupling in neurons  
• E2F & KDM2B/CXXC4 motifs modestly enriched – consistent with late cell-cycle exit/epigenetic remodeling.

Concise interpretation  
Peak-cluster 28_10 contains enhancers that become accessible during late somitogenesis predominantly in neural-crest-derived enteric neurons and maturing CNS neurons. It is controlled by SOX, HOX/MEIS-PBX and proneural bHLH factors and regulates genes required for axon-guidance, synaptogenesis and the functional maturation of post-mitotic neurons.

## Cluster 28_11

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 28_11 captures a neuronal chromatin program that matures during segmentation and peaks during early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at 0 som (≈10 hpf), rises steadily through 5-, 10- and 15-som stages, and shows a sharp jump after 20 som to reach its maximum at 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • This progressive opening indicates activation during late somitogenesis with full deployment in early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest signal: enteric-neuron lineage (enteric_neurons_30 som ≈ 85; 20 som ≈ 38).  
   • Secondary but clear signal: pan-neuronal “differentiating_neurons” cluster and generic “neurons” samples.  
   • Most mesodermal/endodermal or epidermal pseudobulks remain near baseline (≈ 8–11).  
   → The cluster marks chromatin regions specific to neural-crest-derived enteric neurons and, to a lesser degree, other differentiating neuronal populations.

3. Regulatory/biological programme inferred  
   Gene set is heavily enriched for:  
   • Neuronal specification & differentiation: NPAS3, NEUROD1, PAX3/7, ISL1, SOX10, PHOX2A/B, ASCL1-family, RUNX1/3, MEF2, FOXP1/4.  
   • Axon guidance & synaptogenesis: ROBO1/3, SEMA3/4/6, PLXNA1-4, NTN-, NTNG-, NRXN2, RIMS2, GRIN2B, GRIK2/3/4, CACNA*, RYR2.  
   • Enteric-neuron/visceral-motor signatures: RET downstream partners (PHOX2, HOX paralogs), GATA2/3, HAND2, PAX3/7.  
   Functional theme: transition of vagal neural-crest cells into post-mitotic, synaptically-competent enteric neurons and other cranial/spinal interneurons, including wiring of glutamatergic circuits.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (supported by motif enrichment & gene list)  
   • SOX10 / SOX9/8 – maintain neural-crest identity and initiate neuronal differentiation.  
   • PHOX2A / PHOX2B – core enteric-neuron determinants.  
   • PAX3 / PAX7 and HOX (HOXB/C/D clusters) – positional patterning of vagal crest and gut colonisation.  
   • FOX family (FOXD3, FOXG1, FOXP1/4) – neural progenitor maintenance and neuron subtype identity.  
   • bHLH proneural factors (ATOH1, NEUROD1/4/6, ASCL1) – neurogenesis onset.  
   • MEF2 & RUNX – late neuronal maturation/synaptic genes.  
   • KLFs, NFAT/CREB and ETS (Fli/Etv) motifs appear but are likely secondary modulators of growth-cone and activity-dependent genes.

Taken together, cluster 28_11 demarcates enhancers that switch on during late segmentation to drive the gene network guiding neural-crest cells into mature enteric (and related) neurons, coordinating their specification, axon guidance and early synaptic assembly.

## Cluster 28_12

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 28_12 marks a neuronal enhancer program that turns on late and is virtually confined to the nascent enteric nervous system.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is near background at gastrulation/0-somite (~2.5 units) but rises steadily with each stage.  
   • A sharp jump is seen after 20 somites and it explodes at 30 somites (24 hpf) – e.g. enteric-neurons: 4.8 → 8.7 → 13.4 → 16.9 → 23.5 → 63.2.  
   → The peak set is therefore activated during late segmentation/early organogenesis as neural crest cells differentiate into mature neurons.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility:  
   • Enteric-neurons ≫ all other lineages (63-fold over baseline at 30 somites).  
   • Differentiating-neurons (CNS) show a milder but progressive rise (3.1 → 11.1).  
   • Most other tissues remain at baseline.  
   → The cluster is essentially ENS-specific, with some activity in generic maturing neurons.

3. Regulatory/biological programme inferred from linked genes  
   260 + linked transcripts are dominated by neuronal and synaptic genes:  
   – Neurotransmission: slc17a6a/vGlut2, snap25b, syt4, ntrk2a, gria4a, grid2, hcn1, kcnq2, piezo2.  
   – Axon guidance / adhesion: cntn2, lrrtm4, nrxn2b, unc5a, robo-like sdk1a, slc45a4.  
   – Neuronal cytoskeleton & signalling: rbfox3a (NeuN), stmn2a, camk2b, prkcdb, calb2a.  
   – ENS / visceral neuron markers: phox2a/2b, tlx2/3, gata3, ret-co-factors (lmx1, gfra-like genes).  
   Enrichment therefore points to terminal differentiation, axon extension and synaptogenesis of vagal-crest-derived enteric neurons.

4. Key transcription factors (motif enrichment & gene presence)  
   • PHOX2A / PHOX2B motifs highly enriched (multiple motif families 3, 4, 25, 48) – master regulators of enteric-neuron fate.  
   • SOX10 / SOX9 / SOX4/11 motifs (families 1, 34, 35, 61, 63) – maintain neural-crest identity and promote neuronal differentiation.  
   • TLX2 / TLX3, PBX/MEIS/HOX combination motifs – pattern vagal crest and specify visceral motor neurons.  
   • GATA2/3 motifs (family 18) – required for cholinergic ENS lineage.  
   • NEUROD/ATOH/OLIG & MEF2 motifs (families 15, 42, 10) – driving neurogenesis and maturation.  
   • Moderate E2F/FOXM1 motifs (family 6, 59) reflect residual cell-cycle activity of proliferating crest precursors.

Summary  
Cluster 28_12 comprises enhancers that switch on as neural‐crest-derived cells exit the vagal crest, migrate to the gut and differentiate into functional enteric neurons.  Its accessibility crescendo at 20–30 somites, ENS-restricted pattern, neuronal gene content and PHOX2/SOX/HOX-PBX/GATA motif signature together highlight a regulatory module controlling late enteric neurogenesis and synaptogenesis.

## Cluster 29_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29_0 highlights a late-acting, paraxial-mesoderm programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is flat and low from gastrula (~10 hpf) through 20-somite, then rises abruptly at the 30-somite (≈24 hpf) stage:  
 NMPs 3.2 → 3.6 → 60.4  
 PSM 2.8 → 3.0 → 7.6  
 Somites 3.0 → 3.3 → 69.7  
This sharp late spike indicates activation during somite maturation / early organogenesis rather than during initial segmentation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signals are confined to neuromesodermal progenitors and formed somites; only modest opening is seen in presomitic mesoderm and is essentially background in neural, endodermal or ectodermal lineages. Thus the cluster is specific for trunk paraxial-mesoderm derivatives.

3. Associated regulatory programme  
Gene set and motifs point to:  
• Late somitogenesis and segmentation (mespab, uncx, ripply-like signatures)  
• Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of somite compartments (snai1/2/3, zeb1a/b)  
• Sclerotome / dermomyotome differentiation and extracellular-matrix remodelling (col2a1a, col11a1b, tnc, tenm2, bmp1b, adamts family)  
• Hand2/heart-field motifs hint at lateral-plate influence, but their occurrence together with mesp/snail suggests the migratory sclerotome border rather than cardiac mesoderm.

Overall, the peaks represent enhancers that switch on as epithelial somites break and give rise to migratory mesenchyme (sclerotome, dermomyotome) at ~24 hpf.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (enriched motifs)  
• Mespab – master activator of somite compartment identity  
• Snai1a/Snai2/Snai3 and Zeb1a/b – drive EMT and motility of sclerotome cells  
• Hand2 – cooperates in ventral somite patterning and lateral-plate signals  
• Tcf12 / Tcf3a/b / Nhlh2 – E-protein/HLH network supporting mesodermal differentiation

Together these TFs explain the late, somite-restricted burst of chromatin opening observed in cluster 29_0.

## Cluster 29_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29_1 marks a set of regulatory regions that switch on late in zebrafish somitogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is flat/low (≈ 4 units) from gastrula to 20-somite stages but jumps dramatically at the 30-somite stage (24 hpf).  
   • Largest increases are seen in NMPs_30somites (≈ 59) and Somites_30somites (≈ 70).

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility at 30 somites in:  
   • Somites (mature paraxial mesoderm)  
   • Neural-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs)  
   Moderate signal in posterior PSM and tail-bud; negligible in neural, endodermal or organ primordia.

3. Likely regulatory programme / biology  
   The gene list and motif content converge on late-somite patterning and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions that generate sclerotome, dermomyotome and early myofibres:  
   • Boundary/segmentation genes: mespab, meox1/2, uncx, tbx family, mef2ca, lef1, notch1b.  
   • ECM / adhesion remodelling: fn1a, cdh2, col2a1a, mmp13a, tinagl1.  
   • Wnt/Fgf signal-relay components: wls, fgfr1b, dvl2.  
   • EMT factors: snai1a/2, zeb1a/b, hand2.  
   Together, these peaks likely act as enhancers activating the transcriptional programme that epithelialises nascent somites, establishes anterior/posterior somite polarity and initiates early myogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs enriched)  
   • Mesp (Mespab) – canonical somite boundary determinant.  
   • TCF/E-protein dimer motifs – Tcf3a/Tcf3b/Tcf12 cooperate with Wnt signalling (Lef1/Tcf7) in posterior somite identity.  
   • Snail & Zeb motifs – mediate EMT and somitic cell dispersal (sclerotome migration).  
   • Hand2 – lateral/paraxial mesoderm specification and ECM remodelling.  
   • Supporting motifs: Meox1/2, Uncx, Fox/C-class members and Mef2 family (early muscle differentiation).

In summary, peak-cluster 29_1 defines late-acting enhancers that are specifically opened in posterior somites and NMPs at ~24 hpf, controlled by Mesp, Tcf/E-proteins and EMT regulators to run the final segmentation and early muscle / sclerotome differentiation programme.
]

## Cluster 29_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29_2 captures a late-somitogenesis, trunk-mesoderm / posterior-neurogenic regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is flat-to-low from 0- to 20-somite stages and rises sharply by 24 hpf (30-somites).  
  – NMPs_30 somites ≈ 59-fold over baseline  
  – Somites_30 somites ≈ 71-fold over baseline  
  – Other tissues (PSM, hind-/spinal cord, differentiating neurons) show a modest but consistent increase, matching the onset of terminal differentiation around 20–24 hpf.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signal:  
• Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) at 30 somites  
• Mature paraxial mesoderm / trunk somites  
Secondary but notable:  
• Early heart-field/myocardium (0-somite sample)  
• Posterior neural derivatives (hind-/spinal cord, differentiating neurons, neural crest)  
Together this points to a programme shared by posterior mesoderm and adjacent neuro-ectoderm during tail-bud extension.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
Gene set is enriched for  
• Cell-adhesion & ECM remodelling (LAMA4, COL14A1A, COL6A3, COL7A1, CDH10A/18A, CADM1A, ADAM15/17B)  
• Axon-guidance / synaptogenesis (UNC5C, RIMS2, NRXN3A, SHANK1/3A, GRID1/2, TENM2/4, SV2CA, SEMA5B, PLXNB1)  
• Calcium handling & contraction (RYR2, TRPC3/7, TRPV4, LPL)  
• Posterior patterning / HOX‐controlled effectors (many collagen & metabolism genes downstream of trunk HOX code)  

These functions fit the switch from epithelial progenitors to migratory mesenchyme (somite epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, myotome formation) and the first wave of trunk neuronal wiring.

4. Key transcription factors (motifs enriched)  
Motif-factor mapping highlights:  
• HOX / PBX / MEIS – antero-posterior identity of trunk mesoderm & spinal cord  
• Forkhead (FOX-family) – mesodermal EMT and neural crest motility  
• SOX-family – maintenance of neuromesodermal and neural crest competence  
• bHLH / EMT drivers: SNAI1/2, ZEB1/2, HAND2, TCF12/TCF3 – trigger mesenchymal transition of somite & crest cells  
• PAX3/7, IRX, LHX – regional spinal-cord neuronal specification  
• MEF2 & RUNX minor signals – early myogenic and osteogenic differentiation

In summary, peak-cluster 29_2 marks chromatin regions that open at late somitogenesis in posterior trunk progenitors and nascent somites, orchestrating EMT, extracellular-matrix production and the initial assembly of trunk musculature and neural circuitry, driven by a HOX/FOX/SOX-dominated TF network reinforced by Snail/Hand2-type EMT factors.
]

## Cluster 29_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29_3 corresponds to the “posterior–tail-bud module” that switches on only at the end of the 10–24 hpf window.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • 0–20-somite stages: background–level accessibility (≈6–8 units).  
   • 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf): dramatic spike – NMPs rise from 7.7 → 62.4 units and tail-bud cells to 76.9 units; PSM rises more modestly (to 11.3).  
   ⇒ The elements open abruptly during the last burst of body-axis extension.

2. Cell–type specificity (highest signal)  
   • Neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs) at 30 s.  
   • Tail-bud mesenchyme / posterior axial progenitors.  
   • Presomitic mesoderm (late) and newly formed somites show moderate accessibility.  
   • All neural, endodermal, muscle and anterior tissues stay at baseline.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Posterior axial identity, tail morphogenesis and segmentation.  
   • Gene list is dominated by posterior Hox (b5-c13, d9-d13), Cdx, Pbx/Meis cofactors, Nkx1/2, Tbx16/T, Uncx/Lbx, Mnx, etc.  
   • Pathways: Wnt/β-catenin and FGF drive NMP maintenance; Cdx–Hox cascade patterning; Notch/Clock (Hes/Her) and Mesp for somite formation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs with strongest enrichment + matching factors)  
   • Posterior Hox class (HOXC8/9/10/11/13; HOXB7/9/10) – positional identity.  
   • Cdx (Cdx1b, Cdx4) – activates posterior Hox loci.  
   • Pbx/Meis (Pbx1/3/4; Meis1/2/3; Pknox-Prep) – Hox cofactors that bind many peaks.  
   • T-box factors of axial progenitors (Brachyury/T, Tbx16, Tbx2/3/5) – trunk/tail elongation.  
   • Tcf/Lef and β-catenin motifs – read-out of canonical Wnt signalling that sustains the tail-bud.  
   • Nkx1/2 and Uncx – presomitic/somite regulators.  
   • E2F/FOXM1 cluster – cell-cycle genes consistent with the high proliferative state of tail-bud progenitors.

Taken together, peak-cluster 29_3 marks regulatory elements that are quiescent early but open sharply in late NMPs and tail-bud mesoderm to drive the Cdx-Hox-Tbx transcriptional network required for final posterior body elongation and segmentation.
]

## Cluster 29_4

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 29_4 – concise annotation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest at 10–20-somite stages (∼14–22 hpf) but jumps sharply at the 30-somite sample (≈24 hpf):  
 – NMP 30-somites 59.4 (vs ~2 at earlier stages)  
 – Somites 30-somites 70.6  
 – Enteric-neurons 30-somites 18.5  
 – Differentiating / spinal neurons rise steadily to 8–9 by 30-somites.  
→ The cluster is therefore a late, “24 hpf-onset” regulatory module that turns on during early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is seen in trunk axial/para-axial progenitors and their neuronal derivatives:  
• Somites / paraxial mesoderm (especially posterior, tail-bud region)  
• Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs)  
• Emerging spinal cord / differentiating trunk neurons  
• Enteric-neuron lineage  
Other germ-layer populations hover at baseline (~2), indicating relative specificity for these neuro-mesodermal descendants.

3. Inferred regulatory programme  
Associated gene list is heavily enriched for neuronal connectivity and excitability genes – adhesion/recognition molecules (CNTN4/5, LRRTM4, NRXN2, NTNG1/2), ligand-gated and voltage-gated channels (GRIK2, GRID1, GRIN2AB, PIEZO2, CACNA*, RYR2, HCN4, TRPC3/7, SV2, SYT1/7), axon-guidance/ scaffolding factors (ROBO3, TENM2, SHANK2, TANC1), plus transcriptional regulators of neuronal maturation (NPAS3, TCF4, CSRNP3).  
Together with the temporal and spatial pattern, the cluster most likely controls late differentiation / functional maturation of trunk and enteric neurons that arise from posterior neuromesodermal progenitors while those progenitors are simultaneously contributing to the last somites.

4. Key transcription factors implied  
Motif enrichment and TF–motif mapping highlight factors typical of late neuronal differentiation:  
• Proneural & E-protein bHLHs NeuroD1/4/6, Atoh1/7, Olig2, Tcf3/12, Tcf4 – drive terminal neuronal gene expression.  
• SoxC/SoxB family Sox4, Sox11, Sox5, Sox2/3 – keep progenitors neural and promote neurite growth.  
• NPAS3 / Myrf PAS & MYRF motifs – linked to neuronal circuit assembly and myelination.  
• FOX & HOX posterior factors (FoxD/FoxP, HOXC/D9-13) – consistent with posterior spinal identity.  
• MEF2/Runx motifs appear but with low scores, matching modest muscle-side accessibility.  

Overall interpretation  
Peak cluster 29_4 marks a transcriptional/epigenetic programme that is switched on around 24 hpf in posterior neuromesodermal territory, coordinating the final wave of somite formation while priming the same progenitor pool – and their neural progeny – for functional neuronal maturation in the trunk and enteric nervous system.
]

## Cluster 29_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29_5 marks a set of regulatory regions that “switch on” late in somitogenesis and are almost exclusively open in the posterior growth zone of the embryo.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low-to-background from 0- to 20-somite stages, then rises steeply at 24 hpf (≈30-somite).  
   • NMP_30somites = 54 and tail-bud_30somites = 76 are >10-fold above the genome-wide baseline (~3), indicating a late-onset burst of activity.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest signal is confined to posterior axial cell states:  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) – the bipotent Wnt/FGF-responsive cells that feed both spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm.  
   • Tail-bud cells – the continuation of NMPs after trunk somitogenesis.  
   • Posterior PSM/somite cells show a moderate increase (PSM_30 somites ≈ 7; somites_30 somites ≈ 76), consistent with immediate derivatives of the NMP pool.  
   • Other tissues remain at basal accessibility.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Gene linkage and motif content point to a posterior body-elongation module.  
   • Linked genes contain many posterior Hox paralogs, Cdx1b/4, Runx2, Bmp5, Fgf/Wnt modulators, ECM and cytoskeleton genes (e.g. Tln1, Fhod3, Col16a1) that are typical of tail morphogenesis and early skeletogenic muscle patterning.  
   • Biological processes therefore include (i) axial extension, (ii) segmentation / somite maturation, (iii) acquisition of trunk-/tail-specific Hox identity, and (iv) EMT / cell motility associated with tail-bud outgrowth.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and mapping highlight a coherent posterior NMP programme:  
   • Posterior HOX factors (HoxA9-13, B9-13, C8-13, D9-13) – confer positional identity.  
   • CDX factors (Cdx1b, Cdx4) – upstream activators of posterior Hox and axial elongation.  
   • Wnt/β-catenin effectors (TCF7/TCF7L1/L2, LEF1) – reflect the Wnt-high state of tail-bud/NMPs.  
   • Brachyury/T (Ta) and Tbx family motifs – drive mesodermal gene expression and notochord convergence.  
   • FOX (Foxd1/3/5, Foxf2, Foxa) and SOX (Sox2/3/19) motifs – consistent with the bipotent neuro-mesodermal character.  
   • MSX, DLX, NKX and LHX motifs – linked to segmental patterning and early myogenic/skeletogenic differentiation.  
   • Chromatin regulator Kdm2ba motif presence suggests accompanying epigenetic remodelling.

In summary, cluster 29_5 demarcates enhancers that become active specifically in neuromesodermal progenitors and tail-bud cells at the end of somitogenesis, orchestrating the transcriptional programme that extends the posterior axis and patterns the emerging trunk/tail tissues under the combined control of CDX/HOX, Wnt-TCF and T/Brachyury-TBX signalling.
]

## Cluster 29_6

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 29_6 marks the canonical skeletal-muscle gene-regulatory program that comes on line during trunk/tail myogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is detectable as early as the 0-somite stage but rises steadily with somitogenesis.  
   • It reaches a first plateau at 10–20 somites (∼14–18 hpf) in somites and fast-muscle cells and then shows a dramatic spike at the 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf), especially in tail-bud / late NMPs (65.7) and spinal-cord-associated muscle progenitors (70.7).  
   → The cluster therefore represents late-somitogenesis/early-organogenesis activation of the muscle programme.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility values)  
   • Fast skeletal muscle (10.7 → 19.3)  
   • Mature “muscle” aggregate population (10.8–17.0)  
   • Developing somites (10.1–12.7)  
   • Presomitic mesoderm (6–14) – moderate, preceding somite maturation  
   • Late neuro-mesodermal progenitors / tail-bud cells (65.7) – reflecting the tail myogenic wave  
   Other germ-layer derivatives (endoderm, epidermis, endocrine pancreas, neural crest) show only basal accessibility (~3–5).

3. Biological processes regulated  
   Associated genes are rich in contractile-apparatus, sarcomere-assembly and excitation–contraction-coupling factors:  
   • Structural / sarcomeric: ttn, tnnt3a, smyd1b, ryr1b, ttn, ckma, casq1a, smyd1b  
   • Myogenic TFs: myf5, mef2ca, mef2d, mycbp2  
   • Neuromuscular junction & Ca2+ handling: musk, cacna2d2a, slc8a1b  
   • ECM/adhesion for fibre morphogenesis: itga1, lamb2, tns1b, thbs3a, plxnb2a  
   • Energy & metabolism: adss2, suclg2, slc2a1b, slc40a1  
   Collectively these peaks govern differentiation, fusion and maturation of fast skeletal-muscle fibres in the trunk and tail.

4. Key enriched transcription-factor motifs / drivers  
   • Myogenic bHLH factors – MyoD1 (M00117), Myogenin (M00118), Myf5 / Myf6; motifs show the strongest positive z-scores (0.6–0.9).  
   • MEF2 family (mef2aa/b/ca/cb; motif M00120/ M00150) – cooperates with MRFs to activate late muscle genes.  
   • SRF/TCF (serum response factor; M00120) – regulates cytoskeletal and actin genes.  
   • TEAD/Yes-associated factors and FoxO/FoxK motifs appear but with lower enrichment, consistent with metabolic/structural tuning rather than lineage initiation.

In summary, peak cluster 29_6 is a late-acting, muscle-specific cis-regulatory module that switches on during somitogenesis and peaks at 24 hpf in tail-bud–derived muscle, driven predominantly by MyoD/MRFs and MEF2 factors to orchestrate sarcomere assembly and functional maturation of fast skeletal muscle fibres.
]

## Cluster 29_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29_7 – concise interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Broad low-level accessibility from gastrula to ~20 hpf.  
• Sharp surge at the last sampled stage (30-somite / ≈24 hpf):  
 – NMPs (Neuromesodermal progenitors) jump from ~4–5 to 70 (17-fold).  
 – Tail-bud cells rise to ~62.  
• Epidermis shows an earlier transient peak (10–15 somites, 18–20).  
⇒ Cluster is largely “late-on”, coinciding with posterior/tail morphogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Posterior axial progenitors – NMPs & tail-bud (dominant).  
• Surface ectoderm/epidermis (10–20 somites window).  
• Moderate signal in early somites / PSM; negligible in most internal organs.  

3. Putative regulatory programme  
Gene content is heavily enriched for extracellular-matrix and adhesion molecules (col11a1a, col12a1b, col4a4, adamts2/adamtsl5, fbln2, npnta, fermt1, alcama, cadherins, sema3, nrg1, bmp6).  
→ Indicates a programme that builds, remodels and stabilises basement membrane/ECM needed for:  
 • Tail elongation and posterior body-wall closure.  
 • Epidermal maturation and attachment to underlying mesoderm.  
 • Integration of peripheral nerves (rbfox3a, grip1, prickle1b) into the nascent tail.  

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & mapping)  
Highly over-represented motifs point to TFs that govern posterior identity and epithelial-ECM assembly:  
• Posterior HOX / CDX set – Hoxa9-13, Hoxb9/13, Hoxc9-13, Cdx1/4: patterning the tail and activating ECM genes.  
• Forkhead factors – Foxf1/2, Foxa/c/d, Foxi3: control epithelial/mesodermal matrix and cell-adhesion genes.  
• T-box/Brachyury lineage (ta, tbx16) – sustain NMP/tail-bud proliferation.  
• Pax3/7, Msx/Dlx/Irx clusters – characteristic of dermomyotome & epidermal ridge, consistent with secondary epidermal peak.  
• Klf/Sp and Mef2/Runx families – reinforce ECM and cytoskeletal remodelling.  

Together, the accessibility pattern, gene set and TF motifs depict a late embryonic, posterior-specific gene-regulatory module that equips tail-bud/NMP cells – and, transiently, the overlying epidermis – with the extracellular matrix and adhesion machinery required for final tail extension and surface ectoderm maturation.
]

## Cluster 29_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29_8 highlights a coherent regulatory module that turns on late in segmentation and is shared by tail-bud neuromesodermal progenitors and the posterior/ventral neural tube.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises gradually from 0–20-somite stages and jumps at 24 hpf (≈30 somites).  
• Highest values are seen at “30-somite” samples in nearly every lineage that still receives cells from the tail-bud (NMPs 62.5, PSM 7.1, Somites 4.3, Tail-bud 4.6, Neural-floor-plate 19.9, MHB 19.9).  
⇒ The cluster is most active during late segmentation / early organogenesis (≈20–24 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity  
Peak accessibility is greatest in:  
• Neuromesodermal progenitors and tail-bud.  
• Their immediate mesodermal daughters (posterior PSM / nascent somites).  
• Ventral/posterior neural tube derivatives – floor plate, spinal cord, mid-brain–hind-brain boundary, differentiating neurons.  
Other tissues show only basal signals.

3. Predicted biological programme  
Associated genes are dominated by neuronal wiring and adhesion factors (ERBB4/erbb4a, CNTN3b, NTNG1a, GRID1b, GRIA3b, ADAM22, PCDH17/7b, CHL1b, CDH4, RBFOX3b, KCNMA1a) plus Wnt modulator nkd2a and axon-outgrowth regulators (KIF26b, PAK6a, SYNE1b).  
Together with the spatial pattern, the peaks most likely mark enhancers that:  
• Give posterior identity (Hox code) to neural progenitors.  
• Promote floor-plate / commissural-neuron maturation and long-range axon guidance.  
• Coordinate the neurogenic vs somitic choice in neuromesodermal progenitors under Wnt/FGF signalling.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
Motif enrichment and TF lists point to:  
• SoxB paralogues (Sox2/3/19) – maintaining neural progenitor character.  
• FoxA/FoxD/FoxJ family (Foxa2, Foxd3, Foxj1) – ventral midline and tail-bud programmes.  
• Posterior Hox9-13 motifs – axial level specification.  
• TCF/LEF (Tcf7l1/3, Lef1) – Wnt-responsive control typical of NMPs.  
• Pax/Irx and Pax6/7 – regional neural patterning.  
• E2F/MEF2 – cell-cycle and early differentiation support.

In summary, peak-cluster 29_8 represents late-segmentation enhancers that integrate Wnt-dependent posterior identity (TCF/HOX) with ventral neural-tube/floor-plate specification (SOX/FOX) to drive genes required for wiring posterior CNS neurons while neuromesodermal progenitors transition from trunk elongation to organogenesis.

## Cluster 29_9

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29_9 marks a late, paraxial-mesoderm / somite–specific chromatin program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low and fairly constant from gastrulation through the 20-somite stage (10–22 hpf).  
   • A dramatic surge occurs at the 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf):  
     – somites_30 s = 68.9 (largest value in the entire matrix)  
     – NMPs_30 s = 59.4 (second highest)  
     – all earlier time-points are ≤ 3.0.  
   → The elements open abruptly during the last wave of segmentation / early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is confined to the paraxial mesoderm continuum:  
   • Mature epithelial somites  
   • Tail-bud/neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) feeding the last somites  
   • Only a modest signal in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and virtually background in neural, endodermal or cranial tissues.  
   Hence the cluster is a signature of formed trunk somites, not of muscle fibres, notochord or other lineages.

3. Biological programme inferred  
   Associated genes and GO hints point to three somite–maturation modules:  
   a) Epithelialisation & boundary formation – mespab, uncx4.1, lbx1/2, ripply-like TFs, hox A/B/C rows.  
   b) Extracellular‐matrix remodelling – adamts2/3/13, ltbp1, col4a6, thbs2a/b, tgm2l.  
   c) On-set of myogenic differentiation – tnni2a.1, smyd1b, tnnt2e, mef2-regulated contractile genes.  
   Together these point to late segmentation, rostro-caudal patterning and the first wave of dermomyotome / myotome specification.

4. Likely driver transcription factors  
   Motif enrichment and TF–mapping lists converge on classic somitic regulators:  
   • bHLH / myogenic core: MyoD1, Myf5, Myf6, Myog, Tcf3/12 (E-proteins).  
   • Mesodermal patterning: Mespab, Hand2, Tbx6/T (ta), Pax3/7, Lbx1/2, Uncx4.1.  
   • MEF2 family (Mef2c/d) – activates muscle structural genes.  
   • FOXC1/2 and HOX A/B/C clusters – confer axial identity and anterior–posterior polarity.  
   • Snai1/2, Zeb1, Twist – consistent with the transient EMT–like movements at somite boundary formation.  

In summary, peak-cluster 29_9 defines enhancers that switch on abruptly in 24 hpf somites and NMPs, controlled by Mesp-, Pax-, MyoD/MEF2- and HOX/FOX-driven networks to orchestrate epithelial somite maturation, boundary ECM assembly and the earliest steps of skeletal-muscle differentiation.

## Cluster 29_10

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 29 _10 captures a set of regulatory elements that “switch on” late in segmentation and become most accessible in posterior neuromesodermal derivatives.  
Below is a compact interpretation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest (2–3 a.u.) from gastrulation through ~20-somite stage.  
• A sharp surge occurs at the 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf), where signals rise >20-fold (NMPs ≈ 60; tail-bud ≈ 64).  
• A secondary, earlier peak is seen in the optic cup at 10 somites (≈14 hpf; value ≈ 36).  
→ The cluster therefore represents a late-acting program associated with the end of axial elongation and the onset of organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) – especially at 30 somites.  
• Tail-bud progenitor pool.  
• Posterior/ventral neural tissues: spinal cord, hind-brain and floor-plate show moderate enrichment.  
• Retinal neuro-epithelium (optic cup) transiently engages the same elements at 10 somites.  
Other lineages hold only baseline accessibility, indicating a strong posterior-neural bias.

3. Regulatory programme implied  
Gene set and motif content point to:  
a) Neural differentiation & axon guidance – contactins (Cntn4/5), neurexins (Nrxn2), Tenm2, NPAS3, TCF4, many ion-channel and neurotransmission genes.  
b) Posterior axial identity – long lists of Hox, Fox and Cdx-responsive genes plus cytoskeletal/ECM genes needed for tail morphogenesis.  
c) High ciliogenesis/axonemal load (multiple DNAH family members, CEP290) consistent with motile cilia in spinal/ependymal canal.  
d) Continued proliferation of progenitors – enrichment for E2F and cell-cycle genes.  
Overall, the cluster demarcates enhancers that prepare late NMPs/tail-bud cells for commitment toward posterior spinal neurons (and, transiently, retinal neurons) while they are still proliferative.

4. Key transcription factors inferred  
Motif enrichment and TF–motif mapping highlight four cooperating TF groups likely driving this programme:  
• Sox family (Sox2/3/19b/5/11) – maintains neural progenitor identity in NMPs and optic cup.  
• Fox / Cdx / Hox axis (FoxD3/FoxA2, posterior Hox-C/Hox-D paralogues, Cdx1b/4) – confers posterior axial character.  
• E2F (E2F1-3-7) – supports the high mitotic index of tail-bud progenitors.  
• Nuclear receptors ROR/NR2F/PPAR – repeatedly enriched; fit with metabolic re-programming of late progenitors.

Taken together, peak cluster 29 _10 marks late-segmentation enhancers that activate in tail-bud/NMPs to coordinate posterior neuro-genesis, proliferation and axial identity, with a brief reutilisation in early retinal neuro-epithelium.

## Cluster 29_11

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29_11 captures a late, paraxial-mesoderm / myotome transcriptional program

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is essentially basal (log2 values ~2–3) from 0- to 20-somite stages, then explodes at the 30-somite (≈ 22–24 hpf) sample:  
  – NMPs_30 s ≈ 59  
  – Somites_30 s ≈ 64  
  – “Muscle”_30 s ≈ 50  
  (all other time‐points stay near background).  
→ The enhancer set is switched on abruptly during the final segmentation period, coincident with myotome maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is confined to paraxial-mesoderm-derived populations:  
• Somites ≫ NMPs ≫ general “Muscle” pool.  
• Only modest signal in presomitic mesoderm, fast-muscle, neural, endoderm or ectoderm, and virtually none in notochord or endoderm-derived tissues.  
→ Cluster 29_11 is selective for late somites / emerging trunk-skeletal-muscle fibres (especially slow-muscle or mixed muscle that is not captured by the “fast-muscle” subset).

3. Likely biological programme  
Associated genes are strongly enriched for:  
• Sarcomere / contractile apparatus: ttn.2 (titin), mybpc2a, sgcd, myo15aa / myo18ab / myo6b, flnb.  
• Cytoskeleton & focal-adhesion / ECM: col11a1b, col5a1, col7a1l, flnb, tenm2, adamts16, rock2a.  
• Muscle transcriptional regulators and signalling: mef2ca, hdac9b, fgf13a, wnt7bb, mef2-co-factor strip2.  
GO / pathway enrichment (from gene content and motif repertoire):  
  – Skeletal-muscle differentiation, sarcomere assembly.  
  – Actin-cytoskeleton organisation & cell-matrix adhesion.  
  – Hippo/YAP-TEAD and Ca²⁺/NFAT signalling that accompany fibre growth.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs with the strongest positive z-scores and present in factor list)  
• Myogenic bHLH E-box factors: Myod1, Myf5, Myog, Myf6 (motif set 41/42).  
• MEF2 family (mef2aa/ab/b/c/d) and SRF – cooperate with MRFs to activate structural muscle genes (motif set 10).  
• TEAD1/3 (motif set 82) – Hippo-regulated growth of nascent myofibres.  
• NFAT family (motif set 12/20) – Ca²⁺‐dependent maturation of contractile genes.  
• KLF/Sp and KDM2B/CXXC factors (sets 16, 86) – chromatin opening of late-muscle enhancers.  
• Posterior HOX / PBX cofactors appear only weakly, consistent with the posterior (tail-bud) localisation but not driving the core program.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 29_11 marks a burst of enhancer activity that turns on at ~24 hpf specifically in late somites and newly differentiating trunk muscle.  It is controlled by the canonical myogenic module (MRFs + MEF2/SRF, assisted by TEAD and NFAT) and regulates genes required for sarcomere assembly, cytoskeletal organisation and ECM remodelling as muscle fibres mature.

## Cluster 29_12

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29_12 captures a late-stage, mesoderm-biased regulatory program that is switched on during the transition from segmentation to early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low-to-moderate through 0-20-somite stages but rises abruptly after ~22-hpf.  
   • The 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf) shows a >10-fold jump, with NMPs_30 s (≈60) and Somites_30 s (≈70) being the highest values in the entire atlas.  
   ➔ The cluster is therefore a late (20-30 s) activation module.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility:  
   • Somitogenic lineage – mature somites and their neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs).  
   • Vascular/hematopoietic mesoderm – hemangioblasts and “hematopoietic vasculature” pseudobulks (8–13 units).  
   Moderate signal: lateral-plate mesoderm, heart myocardium, and endoderm-derived vasculature.  
   ➔ The element set is most active in posterior paraxial mesoderm and in the hemangioblast / emerging endothelial-blood compartment.

3. Biological process predicted  
   Associated genes fall into three coherent themes:  
   a) Somite maturation / extracellular-matrix remodelling – adam12, adamts9, daam1b, pla2g4aa, tll1, wnt10a/wnt6b, cdh4.  
   b) Vascular / hemogenic endothelium – tie1, ptprb, itga4/itga5, runx1, runx1t1, csf1b, plat.  
   c) EMT and migratory mesenchyme – zeb2b, snai1a/2, runx1, prx, mmp-like genes.  
   Taken together the cluster appears to drive the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of mature somites and simultaneously primes the hemato-vascular program that emanates from the ventral somite (sclerotome/dermomyotome) and lateral plate.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and TF-mapping point to:  
   • Ets / Runx module – Fli1, Erg, Etv2/5 and Runx1 (vascular & hemogenic specification).  
   • Fox & Sox family (Foxc1/2, Foxd3, Sox5/9/10) – paraxial mesoderm identity and EMT.  
   • TCF/HLH & Twist/Snail/Zeb (Tcf3/12, Snai1/2, Zeb1/2, Twist1/2) – mesenchymal transition and cell migration.  
   • GATA2/3 and Tal1 – reinforcing hemangioblast fate.  
   • KLF/E2F cluster – proliferation of these progenitors.

Summary  
Cluster 29_12 marks a burst of chromatin opening in late somites and adjoining neuromesodermal/hemangioblastic territories, orchestrated by Fox/Sox-based mesoderm factors together with Ets-Runx-Gata circuitry. It appears to coordinate ECM remodelling, EMT, and the emergence of hemogenic endothelium from the maturing somite and adjacent mesodermal fields at the 24-hpf stage.
]

## Cluster 29_13

[*assistant*:
Interpretation of peak-cluster 29_13  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is low-moderate at early stages (0-10 somites) and rises sharply during late segmentation.  
• First clear increase at ~15 somites (≈18–19 hpf; e.g. Optic-cup_15 s = 48 AU).  
• Maximal signal at the latest sample (30 somites, ≈24 hpf) – especially in Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP_30 s = 58 AU) and posterior neural tissue (Neural-posterior_30 s = 65 AU).  
→ The cluster represents a late segmentation / early-organogenesis regulatory wave.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility in  
• Posterior axial progenitors – NMPs, Neural-posterior and tail-bud–related samples.  
• Retina / optic-cup (spike at 15 somites).  
• Moderate but widespread signal in differentiating CNS neurons; only background levels in mesoderm, endoderm and epidermis.  
→ The elements act preferentially in posterior CNS and eye lineages.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
Associated gene set is enriched for neuronal morphogenesis and excitatory neuron identity:  
– axon guidance / neurite extension (ctnna2, celsr1a, robo-like cntnap5a, cobl)  
– synaptic vesicle / neurotransmission (syt1a, slc17a7a, sv2ba, cpne2/7, gria3a/b, grin2c, gabbr2)  
– ion-channel repertoire (cacna1ia/2d1/2d3, kcnc3a, kcnh5b, kcnv1, slc8a1a).  
GO terms (not shown) point to “chemical synaptic transmission”, “neuron projection development”, “visual system development”.  
Hence cluster 29_13 demarcates enhancers that turn on as progenitors exit the cell-cycle and begin terminal differentiation into glutamatergic/spinal and retinal neurons.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + TF lists)  
• Wnt/Tcf axis – Tcf3/7/12, Lef1 (consistent with active Wnt signalling in tail-bud NMPs).  
• Sox family pioneer factors – Sox2/3/19b/11/14 that keep neuro‐competence and open chromatin.  
• Neurogenic bHLH / proneural factors – Neurod1/4/6, Atoh1/7, Olig2, Nhlt/Nhlh2 – promote neuronal differentiation.  
• EMT / morphogenesis factors – Snai1/2, Zeb1a/b, Hand2, Mespab – match the axial progenitor to neural-tube transition.  
• Rfx and NFAT motifs – typical for late neuronal maturation and cilia/axoneme gene regulation.  

Together, these TFs explain the late-stage, neuron-specific accessibility pattern and suggest that peak-cluster 29_13 comprises distal regulatory elements that integrate Wnt/Sox pioneer activity with proneural bHLH output to drive final differentiation and circuit assembly of posterior spinal-cord and retinal neurons.
]

## Cluster 29_14

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 29_14 corresponds to a group of regulatory elements that “switch on” late in the segmentation programme and are almost exclusive to the paraxial-mesoderm lineage.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low and nearly constant (≈1-fold) from gastrulation up to 20-somite stage.  
   • A sharp burst of accessibility appears at 24 hpf (≈30-somite stage):  
     – NMPs_30somites = 56.5-fold  
     – Somites_30somites = 70-fold  
     – A modest rise in PSM_30somites (≈4.6-fold) suggests the wave begins in anterior PSM and culminates in formed somites.  
   → Cluster 29_14 is therefore a late, “post-segmentation” enhancer set.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest signals are restricted to the paraxial‐mesoderm continuum:  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) → Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) → Mature somites.  
   All other germ-layer derivatives and neural/muscle/endodermal branches remain at background.

3. Likely regulatory programme / biological process  
   • Rostro-caudal somite differentiation, boundary formation and the epithelial–mesenchymal transitions that accompany maturation of the dermomyotome/myotome.  
   • Associated gene list is enriched for segmentation and mesoderm factors (e.g. mespab, uncx, tbx6/ta, foxc/f, tbx16, myf5/6, meox, lbx, lmx, alx, hox cluster genes) that pattern somite polarity and later muscle/vertebral fates.  
   • Presence of EMT regulators (snai1/2, zeb1, hand2) suggests these peaks also control somite epithelialisation and later dispersal of sclerotome and myotome cells.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment)  
   The motif-factor mapping for this cluster (row 29) highlights:  
   • Mespab – master regulator of anterior half-somite identity and Notch oscillation output.  
   • Tcf3/Tcf12 (E-protein bHLH partners) – co-operate with Mesp and Hand in paraxial enhancers.  
   • Hand2 – balances lateral plate vs. paraxial mesoderm and contributes to EMT.  
   • Snail family (Snai1a, Snai2, Snai3) & Zeb1a/b – canonical EMT/mesenchymal regulators required for somite maturation.  
   • Minor support from nhlh2 and Scrt1/2, consistent with bHLH-driven mesodermal programmes.

In summary, peak cluster 29_14 marks a late-acting enhancer programme that is turned on as presomitic mesoderm segments into mature somites. It is driven principally by Mesp-, Tcf- and Hand-type bHLH factors together with Snail/Zeb EMT regulators, orchestrating somite boundary specification and the transition of paraxial mesoderm towards differentiated muscle-skeletal derivatives.
]

## Cluster 29_15

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29_15 captures a late, mesenchyme-oriented regulatory module that becomes highly accessible only at the end of our sampling window.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Low‐to-moderate accessibility from 0–20-somite stages.  
   • Sharp, >10-fold jump at 30-somites (≈24 hpf): NMPs_30 somites ≈ 67, Somites_30 somites ≈ 66, PSM_30 somites ≈ 11 (all other samples ≤ 16).  
   ⟹ The program is switched on abruptly during the last waves of trunk/tail extension and final somite maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest in Neural-Mesodermal Progenitors (NMPs) and newly formed Somites; secondarily in posterior PSM.  
   • Negligible in neural, endodermal or extra-embryonic lineages.  
   ⟹ Chromatin signature of posterior paraxial mesoderm that is leaving the progenitor pool and entering differentiated somite compartments.

3. Inferred biological programme  
   Gene set and GO content point to:  
   • Segmentation / somite patterning – mespab, ripply-like genes, fgfr1b, rspo1/3, ror2, tgfb2, prrx1, rspo3.  
   • Mesenchymal transition & extracellular matrix organization – snai1/2, zeb2, hand2, itga8, col11a1, col12a1, adamts6, adamtsl3, sulf1, stab2.  
   • Posterior body elongation – numerous posterior HOX, Wnt/PCP (ror2, rspo), RA signaling co-factors (rar/rxrs in motif list).  
   • Early connective-tissue / fibroblast specification (tcf21, tcf12, twist, hand2).  
   Overall: a transcriptional/epigenetic module that drives epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and ECM remodelling as nascent somites consolidate and diversify into sclerotome/dermomyotome derivatives.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene list overlap)  
   • bHLH/EMT factors: Tcf12/3, Hand2, Twist, Snai1/2, Zeb1/2 – promote mesenchymal identity.  
   • Segment-boundary factor: Mespab – hallmark of newly formed somite anterior halves.  
   • Paraxial mesoderm/sclerotome: Tcf21, Prrx1/2.  
   • Posterior HOX cluster (Hoxb/c/d9–13) and CDX – patterning along the A-P axis.  
   • Forkhead & T-box support: Foxc1/2, Foxf2, Tbx15/18/20 – connective-tissue and trunk mesoderm maturation.  
   • RA/Wnt nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR, NR2F, ROR) – consistent with tailbud RA-Wnt antagonism.

Together, these features indicate that peak-cluster 29_15 marks the late-acting chromatin programme that converts posterior NMP/PSM cells into mature, mesenchymal somite derivatives during the final phase of trunk and tail formation.
]

## Cluster 29_16

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29_16 highlights a regulatory module that switches on late in segmentation to pattern, epithelialise and begin differentiating the paraxial mesoderm.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low and fairly uniform from gastrula to the 20-somite stage, then jumps >15-fold at the 30-somite (~24 hpf) stage.  
   • The spike indicates activation as the first somites finish segmentation and start maturing into dermomyotome/sclerotome.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Strongest signal:  
     – Somites_30 somites (108)  
     – NMPs_30 somites (114)  
   • Secondary but clear enrichment: late presomitic mesoderm (PSM_30) and tail-bud.  
   • Only baseline accessibility (≈4-7) in neural, endodermal or ectodermal populations.  
   ⇒ Cluster is essentially confined to the axial/paraxial mesoderm lineage.

3. Predicted regulatory programme / biology  
   • Somite maturation & rostro–caudal patterning  
     – Associated genes include classic segmentation / mesoderm factors (tbxtb, mesp-like hand2/mespab motif set, multiple Hox, ptch1) and early muscle / extracellular-matrix genes (musk, mmp16b, atp2a1, ppargc1a).  
   • Onset of EMT-to-MET transitions that form sclerotome vs dermomyotome (enrichment for Snai, Zeb, Twist motifs).  
   • Establishment of trunk neuromuscular connectivity – large set of neuronal adhesion / guidance genes (cadm1a, nlgn3b, grin2a, adgrl2/3, gfra1b) expressed by emerging myotome and spinal motor axons.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs with highest enrichment & consistent with gene set)  
   • Mesp/Hand/E-box module – tcf3a/b, tcf12, hand2, mespab motifs: segmentation clock boundary specification.  
   • Snai1/2, Zeb1/2, Twist family – control of mesodermal EMT and somite epithelialisation.  
   • HoxA/B/C cluster factors – rostro-caudal identity of individual somites.  
   • Fox (Foxc1/2, Foxd3/5, Foxf2) and T-box (Tbxt) motifs – maintenance of paraxial mesoderm identity in NMPs and newly formed somites.

Taken together, peak-cluster 29_16 marks the late-onset chromatin programme that finalises somite segmentation and initiates differentiation of trunk mesoderm into its early muscle/connective-tissue derivatives while installing axial Hox identity.
]

## Cluster 29_17

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 29_17 captures a very focused regulatory burst that coincides with the end of segmentation and the first wave of skeletal-muscle differentiation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is essentially basal (≈2 arbitrary units) from 10 hpf to 20-som stage, then explodes at the 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf):  
  – NMPs_30somites ≈ 58  
  – Somites_30somites ≈ 68  
All other time-points remain low. Thus the cluster marks a late, tail-bud/24 hpf–specific event.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• Highest signals are in posterior paraxial mesoderm derivatives:  
   – neuromesodermal progenitors (tail-bud NMPs)  
  – mature somites / early myotome  
Minor or no enrichment is seen in non-paraxial tissues, confirming strong lineage specificity.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Associated genes and GO terms point to late somitogenesis and early myogenesis:  
  • somitic patterning & dermomyotome (pax7a, meox2b, uncx, tbx18/20/22)  
  • myofibril assembly / fast muscle contractile proteins (myh7l, mybpc2b, tnni2a.4, tbc1d1)  
  • ECM remodelling & tendon/enthesis genes (tnc, lama5, svep1, col11a1b, adamts2/6/10)  
  • posterior axial/Hox identity genes (multiple Hox9-13 members)  
Together, the peaks likely regulate the transition from proliferative NMP-derived paraxial mesoderm to segmented somite, dermomyotome specification and initiation of fast-muscle differentiation in the posterior trunk/tail.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
• Myogenic bHLH: MyoD, Myf5, Myog, Myf6 – initiate myogenic fate.  
• MEF2 family (Mef2c/d/a) – activate structural muscle genes.  
• TBX6/Tbx16 & TBX18/20 – segmentation and posterior somite identity.  
• PAX3/7 – dermomyotome/early muscle progenitors.  
• SIX1/4 & HOX9-13 – fine-tune muscle vs. dermomyotome gene sets and posterior axial identity.  
• FOX (Foxc1/2, Foxd3/5) and SOX (Sox5/6/9) motifs appear as secondary inputs, consistent with paraxial mesoderm and ECM regulation.

In summary, peak cluster 29_17 defines a late (24 hpf) paraxial-mesoderm module driven by myogenic and segmentation TFs that turns on structural-muscle and dermomyotome genes as tail somites mature into functional myotome.
]

## Cluster 29_18

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29_18 captures the regulatory landscape of the zebrafish paraxial mesoderm as it matures from tail-bud/neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) into segmented somites and nascent muscle.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises steadily during somitogenesis and peaks at the last sampled stage (≈30-somite/24 hpf).  
   • NMPs: 12 → 95 (0 → 30 somites)  
   • Somites: 13 → 48  
   • PSM: 10 → 22  
   The sharp late increase indicates elements that switch on once segmentation is well underway.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (especially tail-bud NMPs 30 s)  
   • Newly formed somites / trunk paraxial mesoderm  
   • Tail-bud tissue and, to a lesser extent, fast-muscle precursors  
   Neural, endodermal or pancreas lineages show only baseline signals, underscoring a mesoderm-restricted program.

3. Likely biological program  
   Enriched genes and GO terms point to:  
   • Somitogenesis and AP patterning – tbx6, tbx16, tbxta, mesp family, multiple HoxB/C/D members  
   • Early skeletal-muscle specification – myf5, myod (RNA-correlated), tnnt3a, unc45b, mef2 family targets  
   • Tail-bud/axis elongation and ECM remodelling – has2, ext2, col6a3, fn1b  
   Together, the peaks likely mark enhancers that drive segmentation-clock output, assign rostro-caudal identity and initiate the primary myogenic program.

4. Key transcription factors inferred  
   Motif enrichment + expressed TFs in the cluster highlight four cooperating modules:  
   • T-box: Tbx6, Tbx16, Brachyury (tbxta) – core drivers of paraxial fate and mesp activation  
   • HOX / Pbx-Meis cofactors – confer segmental identity along the trunk  
   • Myogenic bHLH & MADS: Myf5/MyoD with Mef2a/b/c/d – kick-start muscle gene expression once somites form  
   • RAR/COUP-TF nuclear receptors – retinoic-acid gradient that gates the wavefront of somite maturation  

Taken together, cluster 29_18 represents late-acting paraxial mesoderm/somite enhancers that turn on in tail-bud NMPs, remain open in forming somites and seed the earliest skeletal-muscle transcriptional program under the combined control of T-box, HOX/Pbx, Myf/Mef2 and RA-responsive TFs.

## Cluster 29_19

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29_19 represents a classic “trunk-extension / somitogenesis” regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest at the gastrula/early-segmentation stages (0–10 somites; values ≈ 11–14) but rises sharply after 20 somites and reaches a pronounced maximum at the 30-somite stage (≈ 24 hpf):  
  – NMPs_30 som ≈ 80 (6-fold over early time-points)  
  – Somites_30 som ≈ 73  
  – Tail-bud_30 som ≈ 73  
This monotonic increase indicates that the elements in this cluster are switched on during late axis elongation and early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is confined to axial mesoderm lineages:  
  • Neural-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs)  
  • Presomitic mesoderm / tail-bud (PSM, Tail-bud)  
  • Newly formed somites  
Other lineages (neural tube, muscle fibre, endoderm, etc.) remain near baseline, pointing to a paraxial-mesoderm-specific programme.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
The peak set is enriched for genes that orchestrate segmentation and trunk patterning:  
  – Axis extension / convergence: tbxta, tbx16 (spadetail), tbx6-like, eomes, not, msgn1  
  – Segmentation clock / somite boundary: mespab, ripply-like, her/hes family, cdx1b/4  
  – Wnt signalling read-outs: axin2, lef1, tcf7l2  
  – Posterior Hox clusters (hoxb/hoxc/d9-13) denoting rostro-caudal identity  
  – Early myogenic regulators (myf5/6, myod, mef2c) appearing as somites mature.  
Together these features indicate that cluster 29_19 harbours enhancers driving paraxial-mesoderm identity, segmentation and the first steps toward myotome differentiation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
• T-box factors – Tbxta & Tbx16 motifs, core initiators of axial mesoderm  
• Wnt/TCF module – TCF7/TCF3/LEF1 motifs, consistent with high axin2/lef1 expression and strong Wnt activity in tail-bud/PSM  
• Mesp/Mnx/Uncx & Pbx/Meis motifs – boundary specification and anterior–posterior patterning  
• HOX motifs – especially posterior (Hox9-13) clusters, conferring segmental identity  
• MEF2/MYOD motifs emerge but at lower z-scores, matching onset of myogenic commitment.  
Supporting motifs for E2F and KDM2B hint at strong proliferation/epigenetic remodelling typical of extending tail-bud progenitors.

Summary – Peak-cluster 29_19 marks late-acting enhancers that become highly accessible in NMPs, PSM and nascent somites as zebrafish embryos extend their posterior axis. It encodes the T-box/Wnt/Mesp/HOX transcriptional circuitry that drives segmentation and primes the paraxial mesoderm for skeletal-muscle differentiation.

## Cluster 30_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 30_0 marks late-neuronal chromatin that becomes exceptionally open in the prospective enteric nervous system.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest at gastrulation/0-somite (10 hpf), rises steadily through segmentation and shows a sharp jump between 20- and 30-somites (22–24 hpf).  
• The steepest increase (≈6-fold) occurs at the last sampled stage, indicating that these regions are activated during the terminal phase of early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signals are seen in neural lineages, with an extreme peak in enteric neurons:  
 enteric_neurons   0 s: 2.4 → 30 s: 31.1 (largest value in the atlas)  
Secondary but much lower accessibility (2–5) is detected in differentiating central neurons, hindbrain/spinal cord and neural-crest derivatives. Mesoderm/endoderm show only background levels (~2). Thus the cluster is highly specific for maturing enteric (visceral motor) neurons and, to a lesser extent, other late neurons.

3. Implied regulatory programme  
Associated genes are enriched for:  
• Neuronal projection and synaptogenesis (UNC13B, RIMS2, SNAP25A, CACNA2D1, PIEZO2, KCN family, GRIN/GRIK receptors)  
• Axon guidance & adhesion (TENM2, LRFN2, CADM1-4, CNTN/CNTNAP, SEMA4F, ROBO1)  
• Vesicle trafficking / neurotransmitter release (BRSK2, RAB/RIM, SHANK2, SYT6/7/9)  
• Autonomic/enteric lineage markers (PHOX2A/B-regulated targets, RET-pathway partners such as ETV5, GATA2/3).  
GO terms (synapse organisation, axon extension, neuronal action potential) and the timing/cell-type pattern point to a programme that builds functional circuitry in the newly born enteric nervous system.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
Motif–TF mapping and gene set point to a homeodomain/paired-like network characteristic of visceral motor neuron specification:  
• PHOX2A / PHOX2B – master regulators of enteric and sympathetic neurons; both motifs highly enriched.  
• LMX1A / LMX1B and EN1/EN2 – mid-hindbrain & visceral motor neuron factors that cooperate with PHOX2 proteins.  
• LHX family (LHX2, LHX8, LHX9, LHX6) – promote neuronal subtype identity and axon pathfinding.  
• SHOX / SHOX2 and UNCX – additional homeobox factors active in cranial & visceral MNs.  
• GRHL1/2 motifs (present in the list) suggest epithelial/ENS cross-talk during gut colonisation.  
• Minor contribution from E2F/FOXM1 (cell-cycle exit) motifs fits the transition from proliferating precursors to post-mitotic neurons.

In summary, peak-cluster 30_0 represents a visceral/enteric neuronal enhancer module that is gradually activated during segmentation and reaches maximal accessibility in 24 hpf enteric neurons, orchestrated by PHOX2-, LMX1- and LHX-centric transcriptional circuitry to drive axonogenesis, synaptogenesis and functional maturation of the enteric nervous system.

## Cluster 30_1

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 30_1 – concise interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises steadily through somitogenesis and peaks at the 30-somite (~24 hpf) stage.  
  – PSM: 0 s → 6.0 5 s → 6.7 10 s → 6.6 15 s → 8.2 20 s → 9.1 30 s → 32.1  
  – Neuronal lineages show a parallel but lower rise (to ~8–9).  
• Little or no signal at gastrula/very early stages – the programme is switched on mid-to-late somitogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is in axial mesoderm that is actively segmenting:  
• Presomitic mesoderm (PSM)≫ neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP) > tail-bud/early somite ≈ trunk differentiating neurons.  
Other germ layers (endoderm, epidermis, endothelium, etc.) show only baseline signal.

3. Regulatory programme implied  
Gene set and motif composition point to a segmentation / trunk patterning module that couples paraxial mesoderm maturation with establishment of trunk neural circuitry.  
• Hox-, Uncx-, Meox-, Lhx-, Prrx-, Shox-positive gene roster defines rostro–caudal identity of forming somites.  
• Extracellular-matrix and adhesion genes (Adam12, Adamtsl3, Crim1, Alcamb, Cadm1-4, Ctnna2) and mechanosensors (Piezo2, Ryr2) indicate tissue morphogenesis and myotome boundary formation.  
• Many axon-guidance / synaptic genes (Slit1b, Ntn1a, Nrxn1/3, Grik2, Grm5, Ntrk3, Cadm family) suggest parallel wiring of spinal cord neurons into newly formed segments.  
• Enrichment for cell-cycle/E2F motifs (E2F1/2/3/4/7) fits the proliferative PSM state before final epithelialisation into somites.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (highest enriched motifs & factor lists)  
• Hox class (multiple anterior & posterior paralogues) – positional identity across the A-P axis.  
• Lbx/Lhx/Uncx homeobox factors – dermomyotome and interneuron specification within each somite.  
• Pax3/7, Irx, Tbx (Tbx6/16) – canonical regulators of paraxial mesoderm segmentation.  
• Fox (Foxc1/2, Foxd3/5, Foxf2) and Sox (Sox5/9/11) – maintain mesoderm–neural progenitor competence.  
• E2F/Meis/Pbx co-factors – support high proliferation and Hox enhancer activity.  
• bHLH clock components (Bhlhe40/41, Clock/Arntl) – consistent with the somitic segmentation clock.

Taken together, peak-cluster 30_1 marks the late-somite presomitic mesoderm regulatory landscape that coordinates axial segmentation with concurrent patterning of trunk neuronal networks.
]

## Cluster 30_2

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 30_2 in one sentence  
“Late-somite‐stage enteric-neuron enhancer set that turns on when neural-crest–derived cells begin terminal differentiation, driving axon/ synapse genes under the control of SOX10-PHOX2B-HOX/LHX/ETS factors.”

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest from 0- to 20-somite stages (10–20 hpf) but explodes at 30 somites (≈24 hpf); the enteric-neuron pseudobulk jumps from ~9.5 (20 somites) to 31.3 (30 somites), indicating a late-phase activation wave that coincides with onset of neuronal maturation in the gut mesenchyme.  

2. Cell-type specificity  
• Dominant in enteric neurons (neural-crest lineage).  
• Secondary but much lower signal in generic differentiating-neurons and hind-/mid-brain neuronal populations; negligible in mesoderm, endoderm or epidermis.  

3. Underlying regulatory programme / biological processes  
Gene set points to maturation of peripheral/enteric neurons:  
• Axon guidance & fasciculation – UNC5C, SEMA4F, PLXNA1, TENM2, CNTN/CNTNAP, SLIT1.  
• Synapse assembly & neurotransmission – NRXN1/2, DLG4, MAGI3, SV2, STXBP1, GRIN2D, GLRA4.  
• Neuronal adhesion & extracellular matrix – LAMA1, PROM1, VCAN, COL11A1, COL12A1.  
• Lipid/cholesterol handling for membrane expansion – ABCA1/4, ABCG4, NPC1/1L1.  
Together these features match the switch from migrating neural-crest progenitors to post-mitotic, electrically active enteric neurons.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs enriched & biological fit)  
• PHOX2A / PHOX2B – master regulators of autonomic and enteric neuron identity; their motifs are strongly enriched and many PHOX2 target genes appear in the list.  
• SOX10 (plus other SOX factors) – maintains neural-crest competence and cooperates with PHOX2B during ENS differentiation.  
• HOX-PBX/MEIS combinatorial code (HOXB5/7/9, HOXC9/11/13, PBX1/3, MEIS1/2) – provides rostro-caudal positional information for vagal neural-crest derivatives populating the gut.  
• LIM-homeodomain factors LHX2/4/9 and LMX1A/B – promote neuronal subtype specification and axon pathfinding.  
• ETS family (ELK/ETV/Fli1) & RFX – support neurite outgrowth and ciliogenesis frequently seen in peripheral neurons.  
• GATA3, HAND-/TBX-/EGR co-factors appear in the motif list at lower levels and likely fine-tune the autonomic program.

Collectively, peak cluster 30_2 marks late-somite enhancers that convert neural-crest cells into fully differentiated enteric neurons, coordinating axonogenesis, synaptogenesis and extracellular-matrix remodeling under a PHOX2B-SOX10-HOX/LHX-dominated transcriptional network.
]

## Cluster 30_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 30_3 marks a neuronal programme that turns on mid-somitogenesis and becomes strongly restricted to the nascent enteric nervous system.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Low-moderate accessibility (∼2 a.u.) at 0–10 somites.  
• Sharp activation at 15 somites (~17 hpf) – strongest signal in the tail-bud sample (44.8 a.u.).  
• Maximal accessibility by 30 somites (~24 hpf) where it is highly enriched in enteric-neurons (31.0 a.u.) and still moderately open in differentiating CNS neurons/hindbrain.  
→ The cluster thus represents a regulatory module that is first used in posterior neuro-mesodermal progenitors and is then maintained/expanded in late-forming neural-crest-derived neurons.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Enteric neurons ≫ tail-bud ≫ differentiating neurons (CNS), mid-/hind-brain boundary, hindbrain.  
• Virtually absent from mesodermal (muscle, somite) or endodermal derivatives except modest signal in endoderm 30 somites (likely gut primordium).

3. Biological processes implied  
Associated gene set is dominated by neuronal differentiation / connectivity genes:  
 – axon guidance & synapse formation (GRIK2, GRID1b, NL​GN2a, RBFOX3a, CAMK2d1, CACNA1ab, NGFRa/b, Erbb4b, Fzd3b).  
 – cytoskeleton and neurite growth (ABLIM2, ANK2a, PD​LIM5a, NAV1b).  
 – ECM and adhesion (COL14A1a, THBS4a, SGCZ).  
 – lipid & glycosylation genes typical of maturing neurons (MGAT4B/5B, PIGG, SMPD3).  
Together with the temporal pattern, this points to differentiation and functional maturation of visceral/enteric (parasympathetic–like) neurons arising from vagal neural crest.

4. Likely transcriptional drivers  
Motif enrichment and TF-mapping highlight factors that are canonical for neural-crest-derived autonomic neurons:  
• Phox2b / Phox2a – master regulators of enteric and sympathetic lineages (motifs present in groups 2, 3, 8, 25, 30).  
• Sox10 / SoxE family – required for vagal crest migration and neuronal/glial bifurcation.  
• Lhx/Lmx homeobox (Lhx2/4/6/8/9, Lmx1a/b) and Uncx – patterning and subtype identity.  
• Hox-PG9-13 & Cdx – posterior axial identity seen in tail-bud peak.  
• Fox family (FoxD3, FoxA/FoxF) – maintenance of crest progenitors and gut colonisation.  
• Hand/Twist, Tfap2, Ets (Etv/Fli) motifs appear but at lower z-scores, consistent with generic neural-crest and neuronal differentiation.

Summary: Cluster 30_3 contains enhancers that switch on during mid-somitogenesis in posterior progenitors and are retained in vagal-crest-derived enteric neurons, governing genes necessary for axon outgrowth, synapse formation and neuronal maturation under the control of Phox2, Sox10 and Lhx/Lmx–Hox transcription factor combinations.
]

## Cluster 30_4

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 30_4 marks a neuronal/neur crest-derived regulatory module that switches on late in somitogenesis and is most prominent in the emerging enteric nervous system.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is near baseline at 0–5 somites, rises at 10 somites, and surges at 15–30 somites.  
• The strongest signal is at 20 somites (≈19 hpf) and peaks at 30 somites (≈24 hpf), matching the time when vagal neural-crest cells finish migration and start differentiating into enteric neurons.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is seen in:  
• Enteric neurons (10 s ≈ 2.1, 15 s ≈ 3.1, 20 s ≈ 4.6, 30 s ≈ 31.0) – dramatic enrichment.  
• Differentiating spinal/brain neurons and neural floor-plate cells (2–3-fold above background).  
• Modest signal in endocrine pancreas and other neural-crest derivatives (melanocyte/pigment and cranial mesenchyme), consistent with shared early enhancers.

3. Likely regulatory programme / biology  
Gene set and motif content point to the specification, migration and terminal differentiation of peripheral/enteric neurons:  
• Axon guidance & synaptogenesis – NRXN1/2/3, NLGN1/2, CNTN4/5, GRIK2, RIMS2, ROCK1, ERBB4.  
• Neuronal cytoskeleton & excitability – PIEZO2, SCN1/8, CACNA2D2, HCN4, TRPA1, TRPC3/4.  
• ECM remodelling for neural-crest migration – ADAMTS7, COL12/14, CHST8/15.  
• Autonomic/enteric lineage markers – PHOX2 target genes, GATA2/3, RUNX1T1, MASH-family (neurod).  
Together these features fit the transition from proliferating vagal crest cells to post-mitotic enteric neurons forming early enteric ganglia.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (enriched motifs & gene list)  
• PHOX2A / PHOX2B core regulators of autonomic & enteric neuron fate.  
• SOX10 / SOX5 / SOX9 neural-crest stem-cell programme that remains accessible.  
• FOX family (FOXD3, FOXF2, FOXG1) crest identity and gut-mesenchyme interactions.  
• LHX/LHX-related (LHX2/4/8, LMX1A/B) neuronal subtype specification.  
• HOX-B/C (HOXB5B, HOXC9/10/11) antero-posterior positional code of vagal crest.  
• GATA2/3 terminal differentiation of parasympathetic/enteric neurons.  
• E2F/FOXM1 moderate enrichment reflecting earlier proliferative phase that precedes differentiation.

In summary, peak cluster 30_4 delineates late-somite enhancers that are sharply up-regulated in enteric-neuron precursors, driven by PHOX2-, SOX-, FOX-, LHX- and HOX-class factors to control genes essential for enteric nervous-system assembly and early neuronal function.
]

## Cluster 30_5

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 30_5 marks a late-somitogenesis gene-regulatory programme that turns on just as embryos switch from broad patterning to terminal differentiation of trunk tissues—especially the presomitic mesoderm and the neural-crest–derived enteric nervous system.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at 0-10 somites, rises at 15 somites, climbs further at 20 somites and peaks at 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • The sharp jump at the 30-somite stage (e.g. PSM_30 = 31.1, enteric neurons_30 = 31.1) indicates that these regions open very late in the somitic series, coincident with overt differentiation of trunk structures.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in:  
   • Presomitic/paraxial mesoderm (PSM) at 20-30 somites – the tissue that will segment into mature somites.  
   • Enteric neurons (neural-crest derivative) at 20-30 somites.  
   Moderate but consistent accessibility is present in other maturing neuronal populations (hind-/spinal-cord neurons, differentiating generic neurons) while epidermis, pancreas, endoderm and other non-neural/mesodermal lineages show only baseline signal.

3. Regulated biological processes / pathways  
   The correlated gene set is heavily enriched for neuronal and synaptic genes (NRXN2, RIMS2, TENM2, SYT1/4/6, GRIK2, GRM7, CACNA2D1, multiple K+ and Na+-channel subunits) together with axon-guidance / adhesion molecules (EphB1/2, Robo1, PlxnA/B, L1-CAM family).  
   • In enteric neurons this programme corresponds to late neural-crest migration, specification of autonomic identity and onset of synaptogenesis.  
   • In the presomitic mesoderm the same cluster overlaps Hox-, Shox- and Lhx-bound elements that confer posterior axial identity and prepare newly formed somites for neuro-muscular innervation.  
   Thus, peak-cluster 30_5 likely coordinates “trunk maturation” genes—combining posterior patterning cues with the first wave of functional neuronal differentiation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment & factor mapping)  
   • PHOX2A/PHOX2B – canonical regulators of autonomic and enteric neuron fate.  
   • LHX / LMX family (Lhx2/4/6/8/9, Lmx1a/b) – neuronal subtype specification and limb/trunk patterning.  
   • EN1/EN2 and SHOX/SHOX2 – posterior axial patterning, limb/trunk growth plates.  
   • GRHL1/2 and TFCP2 – chromatin opening in late epithelial-derived neural-crest derivatives.  
   • SOX10/21 and GATA3 – maintain neural-crest identity and drive terminal differentiation of enteric neurons.  
   • HOX9-13 cluster and COUP-TF / RAR nuclear receptors (motif hits for NR2F, RARA/RARG) – confer posterior identity and retinoic-acid responsiveness in late PSM.

Together, these factors define a transcriptional network that opens cluster 30_5 elements precisely when posterior somites and neural-crest-derived enteric neurons begin functional maturation at the end of somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 30_6

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 30_6 marks the “neuronal-maturation” accessome.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest at gastrulation/early segmentation (0–5 somites, ≈10–12 hpf).  
• It rises sharply from 10 somites (~14 hpf) onward and peaks between 20–30 somites (18–24 hpf).  
  This timing coincides with the wave when post-mitotic neurons exit the cell-cycle, extend axons and begin to express synaptic genes.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest average accessibility)  
   1. Enteric neurons  >>  (31 → 4-fold above background)  
   2. Differentiating CNS neurons (hindbrain / spinal cord neuron pseudobulks)  
   3. Floor-plate / neural-crest derived neurons (moderate)  
   Non-neural mesoderm, endoderm, muscle, epidermis all remain at baseline.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
• Associated gene set is enriched for neuronal adhesion, axon guidance and synaptic function (nrxn1a, nrxn2a, cntn3a, cadm2a/4, lrrtm4, grik2/3/4, grin1a, scn8ab, cacna1*, adarb2, neurod6a, rbfox1/3, syt9a, phox2-targets).  
• Therefore the peaks likely represent enhancers required for late neuronal differentiation, wiring and transmitter-specific maturation, particularly of peripheral/enteric and cranial autonomic lineages.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment and TF lists point to a homeobox-dominated network that patterns and matures autonomic / enteric neurons:  
  • PHOX2A / PHOX2BB   (core regulators of enteric & sympathetic neurons)  
  • LMX1A / LMX1B, LHX (LHX2/4/8/9) and HMX family – terminal selector and subtype-identity factors  
  • DRGX, UNC homeobox (UNCX), ALX3/4 – sensory & visceral neuron genes  
  • HOX-B/C cluster factors – rostro-caudal positional identity  
  • Grainyhead (GRHL1/2) and TFCP2/HNF1 sites – linked to neuronal chromatin remodelling  
  • Supplementary support from MEF2 and NEUROD/ATOH motifs for activity-dependent maturation.

Together, peak cluster 30_6 demarcates enhancers that switch on during late segmentation to drive terminal differentiation and functional maturation of enteric and other cranial/spinal neurons in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 31_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 31_0 marks a late, RA-responsive regulatory program that turns on when paraxial mesoderm finishes segmenting and the first trunk organs begin to mature.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is flat (≈2–4 AU) from gastrula until ~20-somite stage, then surges at 30-somites (22–24 hpf), e.g.  
     – Somites_30 s: 63.3 (vs ≤3.5 earlier)  
     – NMPs_30 s: 56.2 (vs ≤3.5 earlier)  
     – PSM_30 s: 19.2 (vs ≤4 earlier)  
   → The cluster is therefore most active during the transition from late somitogenesis to early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is confined to trunk/paraxial mesoderm derivatives:  
   • Mature somites / skeletal muscle anlagen  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (tail-bud NMPs)  
   • Presomitic mesoderm (posterior PSM)  
   A modest peak is also seen in late enteric-neuron samples, consistent with RA signalling reaching endoderm-derived tissues, but neuronal and other ectodermal classes remain low.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   Gene-proximal peaks are enriched near:  
   – Structural & ECM genes involved in myotome maturation (col5a2b, matn4, tpm1, ccn2b)  
   – Axon-guidance / synaptic adhesion genes (cntnap2a, tenm2, lrrtm4, kirrel3, grid1/2, grin2b) → preparation for neuromuscular wiring  
   – RA-metabolic or response genes (dhrs3-like, dab2, bmp6)  
   Together with the nuclear-receptor motif signature (see below) this points to a retinoic-acid-controlled programme that:  
   • Finalises segmental identity of somites,  
   • Initiates myofibre differentiation, and  
   • Pre-patterns peripheral innervation of the trunk.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment is dominated by retinoid and orphan nuclear-receptor families:  
   • RARs (rarga, rargb) / RXRs (rxraa, rxrab, rxrba/b) – canonical RA receptors  
   • COUP-TFs (nr2f1/2/6) – integrate RA with FGF/Wnt gradients in posterior body  
   • RORα/β/γ (rora, rorb, rorc) & NR4A (nr4a1/2/3) – muscle oxidative‐metabolic remodelling  
   • PPARα/δ/γ & Rev-Erb (nr1d1/2) – lipid utilisation and circadian components of myogenesis  
   Secondary but supportive motifs:  
   • MEF2 family (mef2aa/b/ca/cb/d) – myofibre gene activation  
   • TEAD/FOXO/E2F – growth-to-differentiation switch.

In summary, peak-cluster 31_0 delineates retinoic-acid/nuclear-receptor enhancers that switch on late in somitogenesis to coordinate somite maturation, onset of skeletal-muscle differentiation and initial neuromuscular patterning in the zebrafish trunk.
]

## Cluster 31_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 31_1 represents a small set of regulatory regions that become highly accessible only in a few, very specific embryonic contexts.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low-to-moderate (log10 counts ≈ 8–9) from 10 hpf through ~20 hpf.  
   • A first, transient spike is seen already at the 0-somite stage in early neural-crest cells (≈ 30).  
   • The dominant burst, however, occurs late – at the 30-somite stage (≈ 24 hpf), where accessibility explodes in the posterior growth zone (NMPs30 ≈ 54; tail-bud30 ≈ 70) and to a lesser extent in PSM30 (~12).  →  The cluster therefore marks a late “activation window” associated with the end of trunk / start of tail formation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is confined to:  
   • Tail-bud progenitors (posterior tip)  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) at 30 somites  
   • Posterior presomitic mesoderm  
   • An early but weaker hit in premigratory neural-crest cells  
   Most other tissues (somites, spinal cord, endoderm, etc.) stay at baseline levels.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   Gene and motif content point to a nuclear-receptor-driven, retinoid-responsive module that sits at the interface of A-P patterning and metabolic rewiring:  
   • Enriched motifs and mapped factors are dominated by retinoid/thyroid/PPAR/ROR/RXRs (RARa/b/g, RXRα/β, NR2F/COUP-TF, NR1H, NR5A, RORs, PPARs, VDR, THR).  
   • Associated genes include many RA- and lipid-metabolism targets (e.g. rarb, ror2, rspo2, cyp3a65, sqor, hamp, lrp6) together with posterior body-plan regulators (fgf/robo, wnt-co-receptors, eph/ephrin, bmpr2b).  
   • Functionally, the regions likely coordinate:  
     – Posterior axial extension and tail-bud self-renewal  
     – Fine-tuning of the RA/FGF/Wnt gradient that terminates somitogenesis  
     – Metabolic adjustments (lipid / steroid / red-ox genes) typical of rapidly proliferating progenitors.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   The motif enrichment and TF-mapping converge on:  
   • Retinoic-acid receptors: RARγ (rarg), RARα/β, plus their obligate partners RXRα/β  
   • COUP-TF/NR2F (Nr2f1/2/5/6) – RA-modulated nuclear receptors that shape Hox/RA domains  
   • ROR family (Rorα/β/γ) – link to circadian & metabolic control in tail-bud cells  
   • NR5A (SF-1/LRH-1) and PPARs (α/δ/γ) – drive lipid and bile-acid pathways seen in the gene set  
   • E2F/FOXM1 cluster – consistent with the high proliferation in the growth zone.

In short, peak-cluster 31_1 demarcates a retinoid/nuclear-receptor enhancer programme that switches on at the end of axis elongation, specifically in tail-bud and late neuromesodermal progenitors, orchestrating RA-dependent patterning cues and metabolic adaptations needed for the final bouts of zebrafish trunk-to-tail development.

## Cluster 31_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 31_2 marks a late-somite/early-organogenesis chromatin program that switches on in axial mesoderm just as somites finish segmenting and begin to differentiate.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is low and fairly uniform (~2 a.u.) from gastrulation through the 20-somite stage, but rises dramatically at 24 hpf (≈30-somite stage):  
 – Somites_30 s: ≈70 a.u.  
 – NMPs_30 s: ≈52 a.u.  
No other time-point exceeds background, indicating a sharp, late activation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signals are confined to tissues on the paraxial-mesoderm axis:  
 • Mature segmented somites → strongest signal  
 • Posterior neuromesodermal progenitors (tail-bud NMPs) → second highest  
 • Modest enrichment in nascent fast-muscle and PSM pseudobulks  
Other germ-layer derivatives (endoderm, neural, ectoderm) remain at baseline.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Associated genes are enriched for extracellular-matrix and connective-tissue functions (adamts2/5, mmp13b/mmp17a, col11a2, col4a1, tenm2, lrfn5a), cytoskeleton/matrix linkers (fhod3b, fmn2b, myo16, vaspb) and retinoid/RA-responsive genes (rarga, rargb, nr2f family members). This profile matches the transition of somites into sclerotome/dermomyotome where cartilage, tendon and myoseptum matrices are laid down. Thus the cluster likely governs ECM remodelling and RA-dependent patterning during somite maturation and axial skeleton priming.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif and TF-gene enrichment point to a nuclear-receptor module that mediates the RA and lipid-derived signalling characteristic of late somites:  
 • RARs / RXRs (rarga, rargb, rxraa, rxrab, rxrba, rxrbb)  
 • COUP-TF / NR2F (nr2f1a/b, nr2f2/5/6) – integrate RA gradients  
 • ROR family (rorcb, rorb, rorc, roraa) – oscillatory/segmental cues  
 • PPARs (pparaa/b, pparab, pparg, ppard) – lipid-metabolism & ECM crosstalk  
 • NR5A (sf1/lrh1) – axial mesoderm metabolism  
Secondary support comes from MEF2 (mef2cb/ca) and TBX/HOX motifs that cooperate during somite differentiation.

In sum, peak-cluster 31_2 represents a retinoid- and nuclear-receptor–driven enhancer set that becomes accessible specifically in late (≈30-somite) paraxial mesoderm, orchestrating ECM deposition and the initial morphogenesis of the vertebral column and associated connective tissues.
]

## Cluster 31_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 31_3 corresponds to a set of RA/Nuclear-receptor-responsive enhancers that turn on as paraxial mesoderm matures into segmented somites.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Low/moderate accessibility from 0–20 somite stages (10–21 hpf).  
   • Sharp activation at the 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf): NMPs_30 s = 66 AU; Somites_30 s = 67 AU (≈5-fold over earlier stages).  
   • A secondary, earlier peak in the midbrain–hindbrain boundary at 0 somites (34 AU) that rapidly declines, mirroring the transient RA pulse that patterns the early hindbrain.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is confined to paraxial-mesoderm derivatives:  
   • Somites (particularly mature epaxial/external somites)  
   • Neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs) at the tail tip just before they exit the progenitor state  
   • Very little opening in tail-bud proper or in differentiated muscle, indicating specificity for the epithelial somite compartment rather than myofibre lineage.  
   Early accessibility in the midbrain–hindbrain boundary suggests reuse of the same RA-responsive elements in neural tissue.

3. Regulatory programme / biological processes  
   Gene set and motif composition point to retinoic-acid signalling and downstream patterning of axial mesoderm:  
   • Somite boundary/dermomyotome markers – tbx18, tcf25, prdm4, svep1, wfikkn1  
   • Extracellular-matrix and epithelial junction genes – col4a4/6, alcama, cdh2, ptprb/fb – needed for somite epithelialisation and later vascularisation  
   • BMP/FGF modulators (bmp7b, fgf18b, bmpr1a/b) – consistent with integration of RA with BMP/FGF gradients during segmentation  
   • Many metabolic and lipid-handling genes (acot12, acsl4a, slc16a3, ppar targets) typical of RA/PPAR transcriptional programmes.

   Together, the cluster likely regulates “maturation of epithelial somites and establishment of segment-specific RA responses”, and is re-used transiently in the anterior neuroectoderm (MHB) where RA sets rhombomere identity.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif & mapping)  
   Strongest motif enrichments belong to retinoid/nuclear-receptor family (list below), suggesting they bind these peaks directly and recruit secondary factors (KLF/E2F/FOXC, etc.) for cell-cycle and epithelial genes.  

   • RARs: rarga/rargb, rarab (canonical RA receptors)  
   • RXRs: rxraa, rxrab, rxrba, rxrbb (obligate RAR partners)  
   • COUP-TF/NR2F1/2/6 – RA-modulated orphan receptors that refine axial RA gradients  
   • ROR (rorab/rorb/rora/c) and NR4A1/2/3 – chromatin sensors of metabolic/RA tone  
   • PPARα/γ and NR5A (sf-1/lrh-1) – lipid-metabolic branch of RA response  
   Secondary, cell-type–specific co-factors: TBX18/TCF25 (somite boundaries), FOXC/F (mesoderm), KLFs/E2Fs (proliferation), and KDM2/CXXC chromatin readers highlighted in the mapping.

In summary, peak-cluster 31_3 defines retinoic-acid–controlled regulatory elements that first pattern the early hindbrain and later drive late-somite epithelial maturation and segment identity in the trunk.
]

## Cluster 31_4

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 31_4 captures a late-acting, nuclear-receptor–driven programme that switches on at the end of segmentation and marks posterior-trunk progenitors (NMPs/tail-bud) and newly formed somites, with spill-over into several trunk neural derivatives.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is essentially basal from gastrulation (0–20-somite, 10–20 hpf) and then surges at the 30-somite stage (~24 hpf).  
  – NMPs: 1.4–1.7 early → 57 at 30 som.  
  – Somites: 0–2 early → 60 at 30 som.  
  – Posterior neural / enteric neurons also rise (≈2 → 15–16).  
=> The elements open abruptly during the transition from segmentation to early organogenesis, when retinoic-acid (RA) signalling peaks in the trunk.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs) and tail-bud.  
• Newly segmented paraxial mesoderm/somites.  
• Posterior‐trunk neural derivatives (enteric neurons, neural_posterior, spinal cord).  
• Moderate signal in endodermal trunk tissues (endoderm, endocrine pancreas) consistent with broad RA responsiveness.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Gene set: NPAS3, SHANK3, SNAP91, SORCS2, STAU2, HCN1, DNAH9/10, BACH2, MLXIPL, ACSM3, ACVR1bb, etc.  
These genes point to:  
  a. Retinoid / lipid metabolism and signalling (MLXIPL, ACSM3, PPAR targets).  
  b. Maturation of trunk neurons & axon guidance/synaptic assembly (NPAS3, SHANK3, SNAP91, SORCS2).  
  c. Ciliogenesis & planar-cell polarity components important for tail-bud elongation (DNAH genes, INTU).  
Together, the cluster likely coordinates RA-dependent patterning of the posterior body axis while simultaneously priming emerging trunk neurons and endoderm for functional maturation.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
Motif enrichment (row 31 of the motif–factor map) is dominated by nuclear receptors:  
• Retinoic-acid receptors: RARα/β/γ (raraa, rarab, rarga, rargb) with their obligate partners RXRα/β/γ.  
• Orphan NRs & lipid sensors: RORα/β/γ, NR2F1/2/5/6 (COUP-TFs), NR5A1/2 (SF-1/LRH-1), PPARα/δ/γ, HNF4A/G, ESRRα/β/γ.  
These factors are known effectors of RA, fatty-acid and steroid pathways active in trunk mesoderm, tail-bud and differentiating neurons at 24 hpf.

In summary, peak cluster 31_4 represents RA/nuclear-receptor–responsive enhancers that become accessible at 30-somite stage, most prominently in NMPs and newly formed somites, and that orchestrate posterior-trunk patterning together with metabolic and neuronal-maturation programmes.
]

## Cluster 31_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 31_5 marks a small set of cis-regulatory elements that switch on predominantly during trunk/tail somitogenesis and are recognised by retinoid‐responsive nuclear-receptor TFs.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Modest activity at 0 som (notably in early notochord: 36 AU)  
   • Sharp, sustained rise from 20 som onwards and maximal at 30 som (≈24 hpf):  
     – NMPs_30 som 55 AU  
     – Somites_30 som 65 AU  
     – PSM_30 som  9 AU (background elsewhere ≈5–6 AU)  
   → The cluster is therefore most accessible during late somitogenesis/early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors in the tail-bud  
   • Newly formed trunk/tail somites (paraxial mesoderm)  
   • Early axial mesoderm (notochord) shows an initial pulse but not the late peak  
   Other germ-layers and neural derivatives remain at baseline.

3. Putative regulatory programme  
   • Enriched motifs belong almost exclusively to retinoic-acid / nuclear-receptor families (RAR α/β/γ, RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR, PPAR, ESRR, VDR) and to muscle/mesoderm factors (MEF2, TEAD, TBX).  
   • Associated genes include many mesodermal patterning, Hox and muscle differentiation genes (e.g. tbx20, mef2ca/b/d, smad5, fgfr1b, myh7, collagens).  
   → Together the data point to RA-dependent patterning and maturation of paraxial/axial mesoderm—driving Hox activation, segmentation, and the transition of NMPs into differentiated somites and early myotome.

4. Key transcription factors likely driving the programme  
   Primary signal-integrators  
   • RARs (rarga, rargb) and their obligate partner RXR (rxraa/b)  
   • COUP-TF/NR2F1/2/5/6 – RA modulators important for axial identity  
   • ROR (rorb/c) and PPAR (pparaa/b/g) – secondary RA-/lipid-responsive NRs  
   Supportive lineage factors  
   • MEF2 (mef2ca/cb/d) and TEAD1/3 – myotome/muscle gene activation  
   • TBX20/16 and TBX6-family – segmentation clock effector  
   • FOX, E2F and KDM2/CXXC factors suggest chromatin opening in proliferative tail-bud cells.

In summary, cluster 31_5 corresponds to RA/nuclear-receptor–controlled enhancers that become highly accessible in tail-bud NMPs and newly formed somites as zebrafish embryos transition from segmentation to early organogenesis, orchestrating trunk axial patterning and early muscle differentiation.
]

## Cluster 31_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 31_6 represents a set of regulatory elements that “switch on” as the embryo elongates and somites mature.  

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Modest accessibility from 0–15 somites (10–18 hpf) with an early spike in the floor-plate at 0 somites.  
   • Sharp rise from 20 somites and maximal accessibility at 30 somites (≈24 hpf), especially in posterior tissues.  
   → The cluster is therefore most active late in segmentation / early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signals)  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP) – particularly the 30-somite tail-bud pool.  
   • Tail-bud and newly formed somites.  
   • Presomitic mesoderm (moderate).  
   • Early midline floor-plate (transient peak at 0 somites).  
   Other lineages show only basal accessibility.

3. Inferred regulatory programme  
   Associated genes and motifs point to an RA-dependent posterior patterning module:  
   • Posterior Hox gene activation (hoxc10a, etc.) – axial identity.  
   • Retinoic-acid / nuclear-receptor signalling (ptch1, mark4, smad5; enriched RAR, RXR, COUP-TF, ROR motifs).  
   • Hedgehog/Shh crosstalk (ptch1, gli2a) and BMP (smad5) inputs – consistent with floor-plate and somitic patterning.  
   • Wnt/PCP & axon-guidance components (prickle2b, draxin, plxna3) – needed for convergent-extension and neural tube growth.  
   Overall, the cluster regulates genes required for posterior body-axis extension, segmentation and early trunk neural/muscle maturation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and TF lists highlight a nuclear-receptor ensemble that mediates RA responses:  
   • Retinoic-acid receptors RARα/β/γ (rarga, rargb, raraa) + RXRα/β (rxraa, rxrab, rxrba/b).  
   • COUP-TF family Nr2f1/2/6 – integrators of RA gradients.  
   • ROR family Rora/b/c – posterior RA-responsive regulators.  
   • Nur77 family Nr4a1/2/3 – immediate early RA targets.  
   • Posterior Hox factors (e.g. HOXC10A) acting downstream.  
   • Supporting inputs from Gli2 (Shh) and E2F cell-cycle factors (drive proliferation in tail-bud NMPs).

Taken together, peak-cluster 31_6 marks RA-responsive enhancers that become highly accessible in tail-bud/NMP and forming somites towards the end of segmentation, orchestrating posterior axial patterning and early trunk tissue differentiation.
]

## Cluster 31_7

[*assistant*:
Interpretation of peak-cluster 31_7  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest at early somitic stages (0-10 somites ≈10–14 hpf) and rises steadily thereafter.  
• Highest signal is seen at 20- and especially 30-somite embryos (≈22–24 hpf), indicating that the cis-elements in this cluster become fully open during the transition to early organogenesis / functional maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Relative accessibility (log-counts) is highest in:  
• Differentiating-neurons & mature “neurons” populations (all brain & spinal cord sub-clusters).  
• Hindbrain, spinal cord, mid-brain-hindbrain boundary, floor plate.  
• Tail-bud & late NMPs also show a late spike, consistent with neural tube neurons emerging from posterior progenitors.  
Other germ-layer derivatives (endoderm, epidermis, muscle, etc.) remain at baseline.  
→ Cluster 31_7 marks pan-neuronal chromatin that becomes maximally accessible as neurons exit the cell cycle and start axonogenesis.

3. Putative regulatory programme / biological processes  
Correlated or overlapping genes are enriched for:  
• Axon guidance / neurite extension – dcc, ntn1b, robo-like genes, sema3fa/6ba, tenm2, vangl2.  
• Synaptic specification & neurotransmission – nlgn3a, rims3, grm1b, grm7, grid1a/2, gabrb3, gabra6b, slc6a3, cacna2d1/2, scn12aa, syn2b.  
• Cytoskeleton & trafficking for outgrowth – macf1a, syne1a/b, fhod3b, casz1, fign, dpyd, asap2a, rab11fip4a.  
• Activity-dependent / maturation factors – mef2 family targets, nr4a1/2, per2.  
This profile is typical of neurons that are extending long axons and beginning functional synaptogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (enriched motifs & expressed factors)  
High-confidence regulators (motif Z-score high and gene present in cluster)  
• Neurogenic bHLH: NEUROD1/4/6, ATOH1, OLIG2 – initiate neuronal differentiation.  
• MEF2A/B/C/D – activity-dependent maturation of synapses.  
• COUP-TF / NR2F1/2 and RORα/β/γ nuclear receptors – patterning & axonal projection identity.  
• NR4A family (NR4A1, NR4A2) – immediate-early activity genes.  
• SOX cluster (SOX2/3/4/5/11/21) – maintain neuronal competence while chromatin opens.  
• FOX family members (FOXM1, FOXG1, FOXP1/2, FOXP4) – regional neuronal subtype specification and axon guidance.  
• BHLH circadian/clock factors (BHLHE22/23, CLOCK) – consistent with genes like per2.  
Together these TFs form a regulatory network that first drives neurogenesis (SOX/FOX/ATOH/NEUROD) and later supports axon growth and synaptic maturation (MEF2, NR2F/ROR/NR4A).

Summary  
Peak-cluster 31_7 represents a late-neuronal differentiation chromatin program that switches on during 20-30-somite stages, is most accessible in hindbrain, spinal-cord and general neuronal populations, and controls genes needed for axon guidance, synapse formation and early neuronal circuit activity, orchestrated by NEUROD/ATOH-type bHLH factors, MEF2 family, COUP-TF/ROR nuclear receptors and supporting SOX/FOX regulators.

## Cluster 32_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 32_0 looks like the “default-open” promoter / CpG-island compartment of the zebrafish genome rather than a lineage-restricted enhancer set.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at the earliest stage we profiled (0-somite, 10 hpf) and stays essentially flat (log-signal ~8.5-10) through 30-somite (24 hpf).  
• The only noticeable dips are in a few late, highly differentiated samples (epidermis-30 som, heart-30 som; signals <1), indicating that most peaks in this cluster are constitutively accessible from gastrulation through early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• Nearly every embryonic lineage (NMPs, PSM, neural plate/crest, endoderm, lateral plate, somitic muscle, tail-bud, etc.) shows similarly high accessibility.  
• The highest values are in rapidly-cycling or multipotent progenitors (NMPs, tail-bud, neural/enteric progenitors, endoderm) whereas fully differentiated epithelia (surface epidermis) and terminal heart muscle show the weakest signals.  
→ Cluster 32_0 is therefore “pan-embryonic” rather than lineage-specific.

3. Likely regulatory programme  
• Associated-gene list is extremely long and enriched for housekeeping and core metabolic genes (e.g. UBB, RPL/RPS, HSPs, DNA-replication, chromatin remodelers, RNA-processing, mitochondrial enzymes).  
• Gene Ontology (by inspection) points to:
  – basic transcription/RNA processing  
  – DNA replication & cell-cycle progression  
  – core metabolism (mitochondrial, lipid, amino-acid)  
  – chromatin organisation  
These are gene sets every cell needs; hence the ubiquitous accessibility pattern.

4. Key transcription-factor signatures  
Motif enrichment is broad and typical of CpG-island promoters:  
• CXXC/KDM2B – the only “direct” call in the table; Kdm2b/Cxxc1 bind unmethylated CpG islands and recruit COMPASS/SET1 – hallmarks of open promoters.  
• NF-Y, SP/KLF and YY1 families – general promoter-binding factors.  
• E2F (E2F1/2/3/4/5/7/8) – consistent with high accessibility in cycling progenitors.  
• RFX, CREB/ATF, NF-κB/Rel and ubiquitous nuclear receptors (RXR, RAR, NR2F/COUP-TF) – all common at broadly active promoters.  
• Pioneer-type FOX and SOX motifs are present but not uniquely enriched, again fitting a universal open state rather than lineage-specific control.

Overall interpretation  
Cluster 32_0 corresponds to constitutively accessible, CpG-rich promoter regions that drive housekeeping and cell-cycle genes needed by virtually every embryonic cell.  Its accessibility is established early and maintained in most lineages, tapering only in a few late, terminally differentiated tissues.  The regulatory logic is dominated by promoter-associated factors (KDM2B/CXXC, NF-Y, SP/KLF, E2F) rather than developmental, cell-type-specific TFs.
]

## Cluster 32_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 32_1 marks a very specific, late burst of chromatin opening in the eye field.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest (≈4–5 arbitrary units) from 10- to 25-somite stages but jumps >20-fold at the 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf).  
   • The sharp rise only at the last sampled time point indicates that the elements become active as the optic cup finishes evagination and the neural-retina/RPE layers start to differentiate.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • The giant signal (105 a.u.) is almost exclusively in the optic-cup pseudobulk; all other lineages remain at basal level.  
   • Slightly above-baseline accessibility in “neural-optic” and generic neural populations earlier in development suggests that the regions are pre-poised in the eye field but fully open only in committed optic-cup cells.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Genes whose accessibility or expression is coupled to this cluster are heavily enriched for eye-patterning and early photoreceptor modules:  
   – Eye field / retinal TFs: rx1/2/3, pax6a/b, six6/7, otx1/2/5, crx, vsx1, vax1/2, lhx2/9, barhl, dlx, irx families.  
   – Nuclear-receptor signalling components: rarga/rargb, rxr (α/β/γ), ror (α/β/γ), nr2f1/2/6 (COUP-TF), rev-erb (nr1d1/2), esrrb/g, ppard/pparg, vdr.  
   – Ciliogenesis / phototransduction regulators: rfx1-7, mef2, runx, klf, gata.  
   Together these point to a programme that integrates retinoic-acid and thyroid-hormone signalling with COUP-TF/ROR circadian modules to drive • optic-cup morphogenesis • onset of photoreceptor differentiation • establishment of photoreceptor ciliary architecture.

4. Likely driver transcription factors  
   Motif enrichment plus motif-TF mapping highlight several coherent TF groups:  
   • RA/thyroid nuclear-receptor heterodimers – RARα/β/γ + RXRα/β/γ (high-scoring motifs M055, M057, M077).  
   • ROR (Rorα/β/γ) and Rev-erb (Nr1d1/2) – link to circadian/photoreceptor gene control.  
   • COUP-TF (Nr2f1/2/6) – eye-field patterning and RA feedback.  
   • Eye-field homeobox factors – Pax6, Rx, Six6/7, Otx/Crx – required for optic-cup identity.  
   • RFX family – master regulators of photoreceptor cilia genes.  
   • Mef2 and Runx – support late neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis.

In sum, cluster 32_1 demarcates a set of RA/nuclear-receptor-responsive enhancers that switch on specifically in optic-cup cells at ~24 hpf, coordinating the transition from patterned eye field to differentiating retina/photoreceptor precursors.
]

## Cluster 32_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 32 _2 marks a very late, highly cell-type–restricted accessibility program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is close to background (≈2–3) from 0- to 20-somite stages (10–19 hpf).  
   • It rises sharply after 20 som (≈22 hpf) and shows dramatic spikes at 30 som (24 hpf).  

2. Cell-type specificity (30-somite stage)  
   • Midbrain–hindbrain boundary neuroepithelium ≈ 100 (strongest signal)  
   • Hatching-gland epithelium ≈ 50  
   • Minor but above-baseline signal in heart-myocardium, lateral-plate mesoderm and optic cup.  
   Thus the cluster tags two specialised anterior tissues—the MHB organizer and the hatching-gland—rather than broad neuroectoderm or mesoderm.

3. Putative regulatory/biological program  
   • Gene set is enriched for extracellular-matrix and boundary/epithelial-secretory genes (col1a1b, col14a1a, tnn, bmp6, edil3a, itga5, ptprb, sp7/8).  
   • These are hallmarks of the MHB signaling centre (which secretes ECM and morphogens) and of the enzyme-secreting hatching-gland.  
   • Motif enrichment (see #32 row) is dominated by retinoid/other nuclear-receptor elements, pointing to retinoic-acid and lipid-derived signalling—a known driver of late MHB patterning and hatching-gland maturation.  
   • Together, the data indicate that 32 _2 represents a retinoid-responsive chromatin program that prepares boundary epithelium for secretion/ECM remodelling in the late neurula/early organogenesis period.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Highest motif z-scores map to RARα/β/γ, RXRα/β, NR2F1/2/6 (COUP-TFs), RORα/β/γ, PPARα/β/γ, VDR, NR1D (Rev-Erb) family—i.e. nuclear receptors that bind retinoids, fatty-acid or sterol ligands.  
   Secondary contributors (present in the same motif group) likely cooperate with RAR/RXR: MEIS / PBX and HOX proteins (positioning along A-P axis) and SP8/9 (hatching-gland driver).

In summary, peak-cluster 32 _2 captures a late-embryonic, nuclear-receptor–controlled enhancer set that becomes highly accessible in the MHB organizer and hatching gland around 24 hpf, orchestrating retinoic-acid–dependent ECM/secretory functions characteristic of these specialised tissues.

## Cluster 32_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 32_3 boils down to a set of RA-responsive regulatory elements that switch on first in the eye field and later explode in the differentiating retina, with a weaker late echo in the presomitic mesoderm.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Earliest accessibility is already high at 0-somite stage (10 hpf) in optic-cup cells (≈22).  
   • It falls during 5-10 somites, then climbs steeply, reaching an extreme maximum at 30 somites/24 hpf in optic-cup cells (≈99) and a moderate spike in PSM (≈15).  
   → “Early eye-field priming” followed by “late retinal/photoreceptor burst.”

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signals)  
   • Optic cup / retinal progenitors → by far the dominant site of accessibility at all stages.  
   • Secondary but much smaller rise in late presomitic mesoderm (PSM 30 som).  
   • Background (~2) in most other lineages; essentially absent in epidermis, floor plate, notochord, etc.

3. Inferred regulatory programme  
   • Gene set is enriched for retina/neuronal adhesion, axon guidance and phototransduction components (e.g. RASGRF1, GABRB2, PRMT8, UNC5C, EPH-A6, RYR2, DYNC2H1) consistent with optic-cup neurogenesis and cilia-dependent photoreceptor maturation.  
   • Presence of segmentation/contractile genes (RYR1b, TNNC, MEF2-targets) matches the smaller PSM signal and suggests shared RA control.  
   • Overall signature fits a retinoic-acid (RA)–driven gene-expression module used in eye development and, later, segmental mesoderm patterning.

4. Likely driver transcription factors  
   Motif enrichment table is dominated by nuclear-receptor motifs for RA and RXR–RAR heterodimers as well as their downstream partners, together with canonical eye-field/retina factors.  
   • RA pathway: RAR-α/β/γ (rarga, rargb), RXR-α/β/γ (rxraa, rxrab, rxrba/b), COUP-TFs (nr2f1/2/6), ROR family (rora/b/c), NR4A family (nr4a1/2/3), PPARs – all scored highly.  
   • Eye-field / retinal TFs embedded in the same cluster: Pax6, Rx1/2, Vsx1/2, Lhx2, Six3/6, Otx2, Crx, Sox2/3.  
   • Supportive neurogenic TFs: NeuroD (1/2/4/6), Atoh1/7, TFAP4, bHLH family.  
   • For the minor PSM arm: Mef2/MyoD and Tbx factors appear but at lower enrichment.

Summary – Peak-cluster 32_3 marks RA-responsive enhancers that prime the eye field and later drive robust transcriptional programmes required for retinal neurogenesis/photoreceptor differentiation, with a collateral role in late presomitic mesoderm. Key regulators are RAR/RXR–COUP–ROR nuclear receptors working alongside classic retina TFs (Pax6, Rx, Vsx, Six/Otx/Lhx).

## Cluster 32_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 32_4 marks a late, lineage-restricted burst of chromatin opening that accompanies final patterning of the axial mesoderm and the eye.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is near basal (log-norm ~3–5) from gastrulation through 20-somite stage, then jumps 10- to 30-fold at the 30-somite stage (≈24 hpf).  
• The spike is therefore confined to the onset of early organogenesis, when tissues finish morphogenesis and start terminal ECM deposition and neuronal differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest log-accessibility)  
• Optic cup / retinal progenitors ≈ 105  
• Notochord ≈ 74  
• Somites / paraxial mesoderm ≈ 74  
• Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) ≈ 59  
• Background values in all other cell types remain ≈ 3–5.  
Thus the cluster is shared by mid-line axial tissues (notochord, somites, tail-bud NMPs) and by the developing eye, but is largely silent elsewhere.

3. Putative regulatory programme  
Associated genes are enriched for:  
• Extracellular-matrix and basement-membrane components (Col4a1, Col15a1b, Col16a1, Col28a2b, Nid2b, Tnc, Frem2b) – consistent with sheath formation around notochord, myotome and optic cup.  
• Axon-guidance / synaptic adhesion molecules (Cntn1a, Nrxn1a/2b/3a, Robo2, Ephb2b, Efna2/5, Sema4g/5b) – needed for early neuronal wiring in retina and spinal cord.  
• Retinoic-acid / thyroid-hormone signalling targets (Rara, Rarg, Rorb, Nr2f1/2/6, Thra/Thrb) – classical regulators of posterior axial patterning and eye morphogenesis.  
• Hox, Lhx, Dlx, Msx, Pax and Fox family genes that control rostro-caudal identity, somitogenesis and ocular field specification.

Together these signatures indicate that 32_4 comprises enhancers that:  
• respond to retinoid / thyroid and COUP-TF nuclear-receptor signalling,  
• drive ECM production and epithelial–mesenchymal remodelling in notochord and somites, and  
• promote late retinal neurogenesis / axon guidance.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (highest motif enrichments and/or over-represented families)  
• Nuclear receptors – RAR α/β/γ, RXR α/β, COUP-TF (I/II/VI; NR2F1/2/6), ROR A/B/C, PPAR α/δ/γ, Rev-Erb (NR1D1/2) – consistent with the RA-responsive spike at 24 hpf.  
• HOX paralog groups 5-11 – establishing posterior axial identity of notochord & somites.  
• FOX factors (FoxC1/ FoxD3 / FoxF2 / FoxG1 / FoxJ1) – regulators of paraxial mesoderm morphogenesis and optic cup polarity.  
• LHX / DLX / MSX & PAX (Pax6/7, Pax3) – retinal progenitor and muscle segment patterning.  
• MEF2 & SRF motifs – myotome-specific ECM and contractile gene activation.  

In summary, peak-cluster 32_4 defines a retinoid-responsive enhancer programme that is switched on at 30-somite stage to coordinate extracellular-matrix assembly and late differentiation of axial (notochord + somite) and ocular tissues, driven by RA/RXR/COUP-TF nuclear receptors together with FOX, HOX and PAX family transcription factors.

## Cluster 32_5

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 32_5 marks a late-acting, retina-biased regulatory programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest from gastrulation to 20-somite stages (10–19 hpf) but rises sharply at 30 somites (~24 hpf).  
   • The optic-cup pseudobulk jumps from ~4–6 (arbitrary units) at 0–20 somites to >100 at 30 somites, indicating a burst of chromatin opening coincident with the onset of retinal neurogenesis / photoreceptor differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest signals (descending order)  
   • Optic cup (developing retina/RPE) – dominant peak (102).  
   • Enteric neurons (late vagal neural-crest derivative; value ~21).  
   • Hematopoietic vasculature & lateral-plate mesoderm show minor enrichment (≈6–7) but remain an order of magnitude lower.  
   Thus the cluster is largely optic-cup specific, with secondary activity in late-born neural derivatives.

3. Putative biological processes controlled  
   • Retinal morphogenesis and early photoreceptor / bipolar-cell gene expression (genes such as rx1/2/3, crx, nr2e3, rorb, vsx1, otx2 appear in the motif–factor table).  
   • Synaptogenesis and neural wiring (associated genes: GRIK2, DLG4, NTRK2/3, TENM2, CNTN3/5, SYNGAP1).  
   • Calcium handling and excitability (RYR2, CACNA2D2, KCNB2).  
   • Visual cycle / phototransduction precursors (e.g. rpe-/photoreceptor-enriched nuclear receptors ROR, RXR, ESRR).  
   • The weak enteric-neuron signal implies shared use of some homeobox / nuclear-receptor enhancers in peripheral sensory neurons.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched in the cluster)  
   • Eye-field / retinal homeobox: Rx1/2/3, Otx2, Crx, Six3/6, Vsx1, Lhx2, Vax1/2, Barhl1/2.  
   • Photoreceptor nuclear receptors: RORα/β/γ (rorb/rorc), NR2E3, NR1D1/2 (Rev-Erb), ESRRα/β/γ, RXRα/β, RARα/β/γ.  
   • Pax6 & Sox2 – maintain retinal progenitor competence and open chromatin.  
   • Rfx1/3/4/6 – ciliogenesis/photoreceptor gene activation.  
   • Onecut (oc1/2/3) & Pbx/Meis – retinogenesis co-factors.  
   • Zic family & Zbtb7 (Ctcf-like insulator) contribute to chromatin architecture.

Taken together, peak cluster 32_5 represents enhancers that become highly accessible in the optic cup at 24 hpf, orchestrating the transcriptional switch from retinal progenitors to differentiating photoreceptors and other early retinal neurons, with a smaller role in late enteric-neuron maturation.
]

## Cluster 32_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 32_6 captures a late-acting, retinoic-acid-responsive neuro-epithelial programme that is most prominent in the differentiating optic cup/retina.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low to moderate during early segmentation (0-20 somites) and rises steeply between 20- and 30-somites (~24 hpf), where most cell types show a 1.5- to 2-fold increase and the optic-cup pseudobulk jumps >20-fold (102 versus <10 in all earlier samples).  
   • The shape (gradual rise → sharp late peak) indicates activation during the transition from neurogenesis to early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility at 30-somites)  
   • Optic-cup neuro-epithelium/retina  >>  midbrain–hindbrain boundary, hindbrain, spinal cord neurons, enteric neurons, neural crest derivatives.  
   • Mesodermal tissues (somite/muscle) and endoderm are only modestly accessible; epidermis and tail-bud remain very low.  
   ⇒ The cluster is strongly enriched in neural plate–derived ocular tissue, with secondary activity in other neuronal lineages that experience RA signalling.

3. Likely regulatory programme / biology  
   • Associated genes are enriched for:  
     – Retinal/optic-cup development and photoreceptor differentiation (gucy2d, trpm1b, olfml2a, tmeff2a, ext2, vim).  
     – Axon guidance & synaptogenesis (nrxn2a/b, cadm4, ntm, ntn1a/2, plxna2, sema4ba, shank3a).  
     – Notch, Wnt and TGF-β modulators of neurogenesis (notch1b, nkd2a, smad3a).  
   • Together with the temporal profile, this points to enhancer sets that turn on as retinal progenitors leave the cell cycle, extend axons and start terminal differentiation, in a retinoic-acid-rich environment.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment is dominated by nuclear-receptor RA modules:  
   • RAR / RXR family – rarga, rargb, rxraa, rxrab/b ⇢ canonical RA response.  
   • ROR and COUP-TF / NR2F paralogues – typical secondary RA effectors in the eye and forebrain.  
   • NR5A, PPAR subfamily – often cooperate with RXR heterodimers.  
   Secondary but consistent motifs:  
   • PAX6/7 and SOX2/9 clusters – central eye-field and neurogenic regulators.  
   • RFX and NF-I families – ciliary gene and neuro-epithelial enhancer regulators.  

Summary: Peak-cluster 32_6 represents late-opening enhancers that integrate retinoic-acid nuclear-receptor input with PAX/SOX neurogenic factors to drive optic-cup maturation and related neural differentiation processes around 24 hpf.

## Cluster 32_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 32_7 marks the “haemangiogenic programme” that is switched on in the embryo just after gastrulation, peaks through mid-somitogenesis, and wanes when definitive organ primordia take over.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low at 0-somites, rises sharply by 5–10 somites (≈11–14 hpf), reaches its maximum at 15–20 somites (≈17–20 hpf) and is already declining by 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • The shape (early rise, mid-somite peak, late decline) matches the known wave of primitive blood-vessel and blood-cell specification in zebrafish.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest chromatin accessibility is seen in:  
   • Hemangioblasts (5–20 som): 15-24-fold above background.  
   • Haematopoietic / vascular endothelium pseudobulks.  
   • Early myocardium and endocardium (heart‐myocardium bins ~5 som onward).  
   Minor but consistent accessibility is present in presomitic mesoderm and differentiating neurons, reflecting the mixed mesodermal origin of some peaks.  
   (The very high optic-cup 30 som signal almost certainly reflects circulating erythrocytes inside the eye cup rather than a retinal programme.)

3. Regulatory/biological programme  
   Associated genes cluster around primitive erythropoiesis and vasculogenesis:  
   • Erythroid/haem biosynthesis: alas2, cpox, urod, tfr1a, klf1, pgd.  
   • Endothelial/angiogenic: tie1, pald1, sema3d, orai1a, add3a.  
   • Haemangioblast / cardiac mesoderm: zfpm2a/b (Fog2), tbx16l, lrp1b, smyd3.  
   Together these peaks likely control the transition of lateral plate mesoderm cells into haemangioblasts, primitive endothelium and the first red blood cells, and support early heart tube formation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and gene list point to four cooperating TF classes.  
   • ETS factors (Etv2, Fli1, Elf/Etv5, Erg) – core endothelial/haemangioblast activators.  
   • GATA & partners (Gata2/3, Fog2/Zfpm2, Tal1, Runx1/3) – erythroid lineage and endothelial enhancers.  
   • KLF/EGR family (Klf1, Klf2/6/9) – erythroid maturation, vascular shear-response genes.  
   • Nuclear-receptor/retinoid motifs (RXR/RAR, NR2F1/2/6, ROR) – retinoic-acid and lipid-sensing modulation of vascular genes.

Taken together, peak-cluster 32_7 represents a cis-regulatory module that becomes accessible in haemangioblasts during 5-20 somite stages to drive the earliest programme of blood-vessel formation and primitive erythropoiesis, with auxiliary activity in nascent myocardium.
]

## Cluster 32_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 32_8 marks a late-somite, head/neuronal regulatory module.  

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at 0–10 somites and rises progressively, with a broad peak at 20–30 somites (≈18–24 hpf).  
   • The jump in values at 30 somites – e.g. pharyngeal arches 4.3, hatching gland 3.5, floor-plate 3.3 and an extreme optic-cup value – shows that the elements are maximally open during early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility is seen in tissues of the anterior/head region and ventral neural tube:  
   • Optic cup / retina  
   • Cranial-neural-crest-derived pharyngeal arches  
   • Hatching-gland (hypophysial/secretory ectoderm)  
   • Floor plate and hindbrain neurons  
   Moderate opening is also present in endoderm and lateral-plate mesoderm, but trunk mesoderm and early axial populations remain low.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   Gene set points to extracellular-matrix and synapse/axon-guidance functions required for head morphogenesis and neuronal maturation:  
   – ECM & cranio-facial: COL14A1a, BGN, LIMCH1, PDGFC/D, FG F18, MMP-like MGAT4/5 family.  
   – Retinal/neuronal adhesion & synaptogenesis: TENM1/2, NRXN3a, NTM, SYT1a/9b, HOMER1b, MAP1AB, P2RX2, GUCY1B2.  
   – Pigment/eye genes (OCA2) and RA-responsive metabolic genes argue for a retinoic-acid–driven programme that patterns the forebrain/optic field and cranial neural-crest mesenchyme during this window.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment)  
   • Nuclear-receptor cluster dominated by retinoic-acid/RXR motifs: RAR α/ γ (rarga, rargb), RXR α/β (rxraa, rxrab), COUP-TFs (NR2F1/2), ROR-family and PPARs (ppara/b/g).  
   • Eye/forebrain factors: Pax6, Six3/6/7, Zic1/2/3/5, Meis/Pbx, Rfx.  
   • Neuronal differentiation enhancers: NeuroD/atoh, MEF2, CREB/ATF.  
   Together, an RA-receptor / COUP-TF hub likely licenses this enhancer set, while Pax-Six-Zic/Rfx terminals fine-tune transcription for retinal, floor-plate and cranio-facial development.

In summary, peak-cluster 32_8 comprises RA-responsive enhancers that switch on during late somitogenesis to drive gene programmes for optic-cup formation, cranial-neural-crest & pharyngeal-arch morphogenesis and maturation of ventral neuronal lineages.
]

## Cluster 32_9

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 32 _ 9 captures a short-lived, genome-wide “burst” of chromatin opening that coincides with the onset of mid-organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low at 0–10-somite stages, rises sharply and uniformly at the 15-somite stage (≈16 hpf), and collapses again by 20–30 somites.  
   • The profile therefore marks a transient window during mid-somitogenesis when many tissues switch from proliferating progenitors to early differentiation programs.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest signals at 15 somites are seen in trunk/axial lineages that are undergoing rapid patterning:  
     – Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP), tail-bud, presomitic mesoderm and forming somites  
     – Neural crest and hindbrain / midbrain–hindbrain boundary  
     – Floor-plate / spinal cord, optic cup, endocrine-pancreas primordium, heart myocardium and pharyngeal arches  
   • Nearly all other sampled tissues show the same spike, indicating a pan-embryonic but stage-restricted chromatin program.

3. Likely regulatory program  
   • Gene set points to cell-cycle exit and morphogenesis: histone genes (Hist1H2A family), E2F targets (CCND2a, KDM2), extracellular-matrix remodellers (ADAM12, COL5A1), EMT factors (Zeb1a, PDGFRA, ADAM12) and early neurogenic/secretory genes (NPAS3, RIMS2, PCSK1).  
   • Enrichment of many HOX / CDX / PBX motifs together with axial progenitor cell types argues that these elements include retinoic-acid–responsive trunk patterning enhancers.  
   • Presence of numerous nuclear-receptor motifs (RAR, RXR, COUP-TF/NR2F, ROR, PPAR/VDR, ESR) and RA-dependent genes supports a burst of RA/Nuclear-Receptor signalling that gates tissue-specific differentiation.  
   • Concurrent strong E2F and KLF binding sites suggest that the same elements couple cell-cycle regulation (E2F-driven) to differentiation cues (RA/HOX).

4. Key transcription factors predicted to drive the cluster  
   Highest-scoring motif families and mapping table point to:  
   • Retinoic-acid receptors and partners: RARα/β/γ (rarga/rargb), RXRα/β, COUP-TF (NR2F1/2), ROR (rorb/rorc) – master regulators of RA-mediated trunk patterning.  
   • HOX / PBX / MEIS class TFs – read-outs of the RA gradient that establish anterior–posterior identity.  
   • E2F1/2/3 (and TFDP partners) – coordinate the synchronous cell-cycle exit seen at this stage.  
   • FOX and SOX family members (foxa, foxd/f, sox2/10/11) – mix of pioneer factors that keep enhancers accessible as cells commit to specific fates.  
   • KLF (Klf8/9/12) and KDM2B/CXXC-domain factors – chromatin modulators that reinforce the accessible state.

In summary, cluster 32 _ 9 represents a genome-wide set of RA/Nuclear-Receptor-responsive enhancers that open transiently around the 15-somite stage across many zebrafish tissues, integrating retinoic-acid patterning signals with E2F-mediated cell-cycle control to launch early organ-specific differentiation programs.
]

## Cluster 32_10

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 32 _10 marks a late-onset, neuro-mesodermal module that culminates in the midbrain-hindbrain organizer.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is modest from 10 hpf (0-somite) through 15 somites, then climbs, reaching a sharp maximum at 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
• Thus, the regions open primarily during the transition from late segmentation to early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest scores)  
• Midbrain–hindbrain-boundary (MHB) cells at 30 somites (log₂-CPM ≈ 104) – by far the strongest signal.  
• Secondary but clear accessibility in late muscle derivatives (muscle_30 somites ≈ 26) and in earlier axial progenitors (NMP/PSM 0-10 somites ≈ 7-8).  
• Most other neural or endodermal populations remain near background (≈ 3-4).

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
Gene links and motif content converge on “isthmic organizer” identity and A–P neural patterning:  
• Associated genes include canonical MHB/IsO regulators and targets: en1/en2, pax2a/5/8, gbx1/2, fgf10a, lmx1a/b, otx1/2, vax1/2, msx, barhl, tlx, hoxa/b clusters.  
• Concomitant muscle-gene representation (mef2, myf5/6, myog, tnn, ttn) fits the smaller muscle signal seen at 30 somites.  
Collectively the cluster likely comprises enhancers that (i) set up the MHB/i sthmic organizer, coordinating Wnt/Fgf signalling and dopaminergic neuron programmes, and (ii) contribute secondarily to late myogenic maturation.

4. Predicted key transcription factors  
Motif enrichment and TF-gene presence point to:  
• Engrailed/En (En1, En2) and Pax2/5/8 – core drivers of MHB organiser.  
• Gbx2, Otx2, Lmx1a/b – patterning and dopaminergic neuron specification.  
• Msx/Dlx/Barhl family – boundary and roof-plate neurons.  
• MEF2 and MyoD/Myf5 – explain muscle branch of accessibility.  
• Fox, Sox and Hox motifs are enriched but more broadly acting; they likely cooperate with the MHB factors in axial progenitors.

In summary, peak cluster 32 _10 contains late-opening regulatory elements that are maximally accessible in midbrain-hindbrain-boundary cells at 24 hpf, with a minor arm in maturing muscle.  These regions encode the transcriptional circuitry of the isthmic organizer and adjacent anterior hindbrain, orchestrated chiefly by Pax2/5/8, Engrailed, Gbx/Otx and Lmx family factors, with MEF2-family input in muscle derivatives.
]

## Cluster 32_11

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 32_11 corresponds to the “optic-cup / nascent-retina” regulatory program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Almost silent before the 10-somite stage.  
   • Accessibility rises sharply at 10 somites (≈14 hpf), continues to climb at 15–20 somites and reaches a maximum at 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   → It marks the transition from optic-cup formation to early retinal neurogenesis / photoreceptor commitment.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest values are restricted to optic-cup pseudobulks (optic_cup_10–30 somites; e.g. 37.4 at 10 s, 100.1 at 30 s).  
   • Moderate signal in “neural_optic” and generic neuronal clusters; negligible in mesoderm, endoderm or somites.  
   → The cluster is retina-specific, particularly in retinal progenitors and the first photoreceptor precursors.

3. Regulatory / biological program  
   Associated genes are a textbook list of early retinal / photoreceptor genes:  
   – Phototransduction & visual cycle: abca4a/b, stra6, impg1b, cacna2d3, hcn4, opn4a.  
   – Synaptic / axon-guidance molecules: egflam, ncam2, ntrk3b, gpr143, astn1.  
   – Transcriptional/epigenetic regulators found in retinal progenitors (hook3, pbx1b, tcf25).  
   – ECM and polarity factors (pard3bb, patj) needed for optic-cup morphogenesis.  
   Combined, these peaks regulate genes required for optic-cup evagination, retinal progenitor maintenance and the onset of photoreceptor differentiation.

4. Key transcription factors (motif enrichment & mapping)  
   • Core retina/photoreceptor homeobox factors: Rx (rx1/2/3), Crx, Otx1/2, Vsx1, Six3/6, Lhx2.  
   • Eye field / dorsal–ventral patterning: Pax6, Vax1/2, Tbx2/5.  
   • Photoreceptor lineage TFs: Nrl, Maf, Rorb/​Ror β, Nr2e3 (via COUP-TF/NR2F motifs).  
   • Retinoic-acid nuclear receptors (RARα/β/γ, RXR, COUP-TF) – fits the strong presence of stra6 and other RA-responsive genes.  
   • bHLH neurogenic factors (Atoh/NeuroD, Olig2) that drive neuronal birth within the retina.  

Together, the motif and gene content indicate that the cluster is opened by the classic eye-field TF ensemble (Rx/Six/Otx/Pax6) and later maintained by photoreceptor determinants (Crx, Nrl, Maf, Ror) under retinoic-acid control.

Summary  
Peak cluster 32_11 delineates cis-regulatory elements that become accessible specifically in optic-cup cells starting at ~14 hpf and remain highly open through 24 hpf, orchestrated by eye-field and photoreceptor TFs to activate genes needed for retinal morphogenesis and early photoreceptor differentiation.
]

## Cluster 32_12

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 32_12 – concise interpretation  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is low at gastrula/0-som (0.7) and dips again at 10-som (0.4) but rises sharply from 15-som (~4) and explodes at 30-som (24 hpf) to ~100.  
→ The regulatory module switches on during early organogenesis and reaches maximal activity late (∼24 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity  
• The only cell type showing a colossal signal is the optic-cup/retinal lineage (98.7 at 30 som; 3–4 at 5–20 som).  
• All other neural or mesoderm/endoderm pseudobulks hover around the background (~2.5).  
→ Cluster 32_12 marks retina/optic-cup progenitors and nascent photoreceptors.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Associated gene set is heavily enriched for eye-field / retinal genes: rx1/2/3, crx, otx1/2/5, pax6a/b, six3/6/7, vsx1/2, rorb/rorc, mito­genic TFs (mitfa/tfec), phototransduction components (opn1mw, rdh8, ryr2), axon-guidance (robo, sema, eph/ephrin) etc.  
Biological processes likely controlled:  
• Eye-field patterning & optic-cup morphogenesis  
• Retinal progenitor maintenance and cell-cycle exit  
• On-set of photoreceptor differentiation and visual cycle genes  
• Retinoic-acid– and nuclear-receptor-mediated maturation cues

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
High-confidence direct regulators:  
• Pax6 (master eye-field TF)  
• Rx / Rax (rx1/2/3 motifs)  
• Six3/Six6 & Otx/Crx homeobox factors  
• Vsx1/Vsx2 (bipolar-/progenitor-specific)  
• Sox2/3/19 (early neural/retinal progenitors)  
• FoxG1 (optic-vesicle polarity)  
• Nuclear receptors of retinoic-acid pathway – RARα/β/γ, RXRα/β, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR family – consistent with strong RARE/RXRE motif scores  
Supportive/co-factors: Maf (photoreceptor maturation), NeuroD/Neurogenin, TFEB/TFE3/MITF family, CREB/ATF (activity-dependent enhancers).

Summary  
Cluster 32_12 contains enhancers that switch on specifically in the optic-cup after 15-somites, coinciding with retinal neurogenesis. They are controlled by the canonical eye-field TF network (Pax6, Rx, Six/Otx, Sox) and retinoic-acid nuclear receptors, orchestrating late optic-cup maturation and the first wave of photoreceptor differentiation.

## Cluster 32_13

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 32_13 tags a surface-ectoderm-specific regulatory module that is switched on soon after gastrulation, drives epidermal gene expression through somitogenesis, and is re-deployed in the hatching-gland at the end of the time-series.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises already at 0–5-somite stages (10–11 hpf), is maximal through 10–20 somites (14–20 hpf) in the epidermis, and shows an additional late spike at 30 somites (24 hpf) that is almost exclusively contributed by the hatching-gland (100-fold higher signal).  
• By 24 hpf epidermal accessibility falls, indicating transition from generic skin program to hatching-gland-specific secretion program.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Early–mid stages: Pavement/basal epidermis (epidermis pseudobulks 0–20 s) and, to a lesser extent, periderm-related enteric-neuron/EVL fractions.  
• Late stage: Hatching-gland cells (surface ectoderm derivative) dominate.  
• Most mesodermal, endodermal or neural lineages show only basal background (~3–4 log-counts).

3. Implied regulatory program  
Associated genes map to classical skin / surface-ectoderm functions:  
• Barrier/adhesion & basement-membrane – itgb4, itga3b, itga2.2, cdh26, col7a1, col4a3/4, col28a2, adamtsl3, serpinh2.  
• Epidermal stem-cell regulators – tp63, lrig1, lgr4, ror1.  
• Wound-healing / keratinocyte signalling – padi2, igfbp2a, wnt6b, bamBIb, map3k15.  
• Ion/fluid homeostasis typical of periderm – atp1a1b, atp2b4, npr2, hpgd.  
Collectively the peaks likely represent enhancers controlling specification, stratification and functional maturation of the embryonic epidermis/periderm and the specialised secretory hatching-gland.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment and gene/motif presence point to:  
• TP63 (p63) – master regulator of epidermal fate; motif strongly enriched (cluster contains TP63 motif M051).  
• TFAP2 family (tfap2a/2c) – activates surface-ectoderm and periderm enhancers.  
• SOX/FOX co-factors (SOX3/5/8, FOXI/FOXS) – broadly enriched and cooperate with TP63 in ectoderm.  
• GATA factors (Gata3/4/6) – reinforce epithelial differentiation and secretory programs.  
• Nuclear receptors ROR/THR/ESR/PPAR – motifs abundant in the cluster, fitting presence of thrab, ror1/rorb, etc., and consistent with hormone-responsive maturation of epidermal derivatives.  
These TFs together build a surface-ectoderm/hatching-gland transcriptional circuit, explaining the accessibility profile and gene set of peak-cluster 32_13.

## Cluster 32_14

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 32 _14 captures a broad “late-neurogenesis” chromatin program that turns on as neurones exit the cell cycle and begin to wire up the nervous system.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at 10-somite (~14 hpf) in many lineages, but rises steadily and peaks at 20- to 30-somite stages (≈22–24 hpf).  
   • Highest pseudobulk values (1.6–2.3) are seen at 30-somites, indicating maximal activity during early organogenesis when neuronal differentiation and circuit assembly accelerate.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest-scoring populations)  
   • Differentiating neurones (brain & spinal cord)  
   • Enteric neurones  
   • Hindbrain & midbrain-hindbrain boundary neurones  
   • Neural crest derivatives (early peripheral neurones)  
   • Floor plate / neural floor-plate tissues  
   Non-neural tissues show only baseline accessibility, highlighting neuronal bias.

3. Biological processes likely regulated  
   The associated gene list is heavily enriched for:  
   • Synaptic transmission and excitability – ion channels (CACNAs, KCNs, SCN8A, RYR2, SLC17A7, GRIA/GRIK/GRIN glutamate receptors, GABA receptors).  
   • Axon guidance & neurite outgrowth – ERBB4, NRGs, NCAM1, CNTN/CNTNAP, L1CAM-family, ADAM/ADAMTS, collagens, semaphorins/EPH receptors.  
   • Activity-dependent maturation and plasticity – NPAS3, MEF2-family targets, ROR/NR2F nuclear receptors.  
   • Regional specification along the A-P axis – abundant HOX, LHX, DLX, PBX/MEIS patterning genes.  
   Altogether, the peak set marks enhancers/promoters that drive terminal neuronal differentiation, synaptogenesis and regional patterning of the zebrafish CNS and PNS.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs strongly enriched in the cluster)  
   • SOX family (SOX2/3/4/11/14/21) – maintains neural identity and initiates differentiation.  
   • bHLH proneural factors (NEUROD1/2/4/6, ATOH1/7, ASCL1, OLIG2) – push cells into neuronal lineages and subtype programmes.  
   • LHX / DLX / PBX-MEIS / HOX homeodomain factors – confer rhombomeric and axial positional identity.  
   • FOXP/FOXD/FOXF & other FOX proteins – neurite outgrowth, axon pathfinding.  
   • RFX factors – ciliogenesis and neuronal subtype traits.  
   • MEF2 family – activity-dependent synaptic gene regulation during maturation.  
   • Nuclear receptors (ROR, NR2F/COUP-TF, RAR/RXR, PPAR) – late maturation and metabolic tuning of neurones.  
   These TFs together explain the late, neuron-restricted accessibility pattern and the functional gene content of the cluster.

In summary, peak cluster 32 _14 represents a neuron-specific enhancer set that becomes most accessible around 20–30 somites and orchestrates the transition from neural progenitor to regionally specified, electrically active neurones in the developing zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 32_15

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 32_15 marks a late-neuronal/retinal enhancer program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest through early somitogenesis (0–10 somites) but rises sharply after 15 somites.  
   • The signal peaks at the 30-somite/24 hpf stage, indicating major activity during early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest values)  
   • Optic cup/retina precursors (optic_cup_30 somites ≈ 108; by far the strongest signal).  
   • Differentiating CNS neurons (differentiating_neurons 15–30 somites 15–19).  
   • Enteric neurons (enteric_neurons 20–30 somites 21–31).  
   Thus the cluster is retina-centric but shared with late-born neuronal populations.

3. Implied regulatory program  
   • Associated genes are enriched for synaptogenesis and neuronal wiring (nrxn1/2, nlgn1, shank1, snap25, slc17a6, grin/grik, gabrb1), axon-guidance/repulsion (robo1, unc5c, slit3, sema3f), and neural adhesion (cntn4, lrr, iglons).  
   • Presence of tyrp1a, per2, roraa/b suggests photoreceptor / circadian and pigment pathways typical of the developing eye.  
   • Taken together, peaks likely regulate maturation of retinal neurons/ganglion cells and other late-differentiating neurons.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (top motif families enriched)  
   • Nuclear-receptor retinoid/ROR branch: RARα/β/γ (rarga/b), RXRα/β, RORα/β/γ, COUP-TF/NR2F1/2 – consistent with retinoic-acid-controlled eye development.  
   • Homeobox eye/brain factors: Pax6/ Pax2, CRX, Otx, Vsx, Lhx, Dlx – core regulators of retinal and neuronal subtype identity.  
   • SoxC / SoxB factors (Sox2, Sox4/11) – promote neural progenitor maintenance and neuronal differentiation.  
   • Fox family (Foxg1, Foxd1/3, Foxi, Foxk) – patterning of forebrain and optic vesicle.  
   • Rfx and Nrl/Maf motifs also appear, fitting photoreceptor gene regulation.

In summary, peak-cluster 32_15 comprises enhancers that turn on late, primarily in optic-cup cells and maturing neurons, and are driven by retinoid-nuclear-receptor, homeobox, Sox and Fox TFs to orchestrate retinal neurogenesis, synapse formation and circadian/photoreceptor programs.

## Cluster 33_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 33_0 marks regulatory DNA that is active in the posterior growth zone of the embryo.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0-somite stage and stays elevated during early somitogenesis.  
   • In most tissues the signal gradually falls by 20–30 somites, but in the tail-bud it surges again (≈28–33 a.u. at 30 somites), indicating continued activity while the posterior axis is still elongating.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Tail-bud cells (all time-points, especially 0 s & 30 s).  
   • Notochord and neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs).  
   • Posterior presomitic mesoderm / early somites show moderate signal; anterior neural, endodermal or pancreatic lineages are low.  
   → The pattern fits the multipotent progenitor compartment that fuels axis extension.

3. Implied regulatory programme  
   • Posterior body-plan extension, convergent-extension movements, segmentation and early somitic / notochord differentiation.  
   • Gene set reinforces this: ta (brachyury), cdx1b/cdx4, tbx16, fgf18b, fgf7, wnt/vegf components, many posterior Hox (Hoxa9-13, Hoxb7-13, Hoxc8-13, Hoxd9-13) and segmentation factors (msx, dlx, lbx, uncx).  
   • Enriched GO/process terms expected: Wnt/FGF signalling, axial mesoderm formation, trunk-tail morphogenesis.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (high-scoring motifs & motif-factor table)  
   • Posterior/caudal identity: Cdx family (cdx1b, cdx4).  
   • Core axis-extension TFs: Brachyury/T (ta) and Tbx16/6 motifs.  
   • Posterior Hox9-13 class motifs (Hoxa/b/c/d 9-13) – patterning along the AP axis.  
   • Wnt effectors: Tcf/Lef (tcf7, tcf7l1/2) and β-catenin partners.  
   • FGF/Mapk read-outs: Ets/Elk/Etv motifs.  
   • Fox (foxc1/2, foxf1/2, foxd3/5) and Msx/Dlx motifs that regulate mesoderm vs neural decisions.  

Collectively, cluster 33_0 represents a posterior growth-zone enhancer set controlled by Cdx–Brachyury–Hox–Tcf networks that keep tail-bud/NMP chromatin open while driving elongation of the zebrafish trunk and tail.

## Cluster 33_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 33_1 = “Neural-tube / spinal-cord regulatory module”

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already high at 0-somite (10 hpf) and remains elevated throughout the series.  
• Absolute maxima are between 10- to 20-somite stages (≈13–18 hpf), coinciding with the burst of neurogenesis and patterning of the neural tube.  
• Slight tapering is seen by 30 somites.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest mean accessibility)  
1. Spinal cord (all dorsal/ventral bins)  
2. Hindbrain anlage  
3. Neural floor-plate / floor-plate cells  
4. Differentiating neurons (trunk & brain)  
5. Enteric / neural-crest derived neurons (moderate)  
Mesodermal tissues (PSM, somites, muscle) show only background levels, confirming neural specificity.

3. Biological programme represented  
• Anterior-posterior patterning of the neural tube – strong enrichment for HOX, PBX/MEIS and UNCX motifs plus expression of hoxb1-b5, hoxd3/4, meis1/2, pbx1/3/4.  
• Dorsoventral domain specification – motifs/genes for Foxa2 (floor plate), Nkx2.2/6.1 (ventral), Irx & Pax class (dorsal/intermediate), Lhx/Lbx, Barhl.  
• Neural progenitor maintenance & neurogenesis – SoxB1 (sox2/3), SoxC (sox4/11), proneural bHLH factors (neurog1, neurod4, atoh1).  
• Axon guidance / early neuronal maturation – robo1/2, slit genes, runt-related (runx1/3), Rfx family, etc.  
Overall, the cluster marks chromatin regions that coordinate positional identity and differentiation of spinal-cord and hind-brain neurons.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs strongly enriched and genes co-expressed)  
• HOX paralogs (Hoxb1/2/3/4/5, Hoxa/d groups) – A–P code.  
• PBX / MEIS / PKNOX (co-factors that bind the same motifs).  
• PAX6 / PAX3 / PAX7 – dorsal/intermediate neural-tube regulators.  
• SOX family: Sox2/3/19 (progenitor maintenance) and Sox4/11 (neurogenesis).  
• FOXA2 / FOXP / FOXC – ventral midline & floor-plate specification.  
• IRX (Irx1/3/5/7) & LHX/LBX – columnar identity.  
• DLX / BARHL / UNCX – early interneuron patterning.  
• E2F & MYBL factors appear because many peaks are also open in proliferating neural progenitors.

Taken together, cluster 33_1 demarcates the regulatory landscape that patterns and generates neurons in the zebrafish neural tube and hindbrain from gastrulation through early organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 33_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 33_2 highlights a set of regulatory elements that become progressively accessible as zebrafish embryos transit from late gastrulation into organogenesis and that are shared by several ventral/mesendoderm-derived organ primordia and by mid-line neural tissue.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility already detectable at 0–5-somite stage, but rises steadily and reaches a maximum around 20–30 somites (~22–24 hpf) in most lineages (e.g. lateral-plate mesoderm 49 → 68; neural floor-plate 41 → 60; optic cup 41 → 60).  
• A transient early shoulder (5–10 somites) is seen in endocrine pancreas and hatching-gland, consistent with their earlier specification.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest mean accessibility)  
1. Lateral-plate mesoderm (all time points)  
2. Neural floor-plate (Shh-responsive mid-line)  
3. Optic cup / eye field  
4. Somites / fast muscle blocks  
5. Endocrine pancreas (early peak)  
6. Hatching-gland and pharyngeal arches  
These tissues are all derivatives of ventral mesendoderm or Shh-patterned mid-line/antero-ventral ectoderm.

3. Putative regulatory programme  
Gene set is enriched for:  
• Cardiopharyngeal/lateral-plate markers (gata4/6, tbx1/4/5, tcf21, hand2, foxf1/2, vegfab, tie1) – heart, vasculature, limb/fin-bud competence.  
• Endodermal organ genes (pdx1, rfx6, insra/b, ptf1a, gata4/6) – budding pancreas/liver.  
• Mid-line Shh axis genes (foxa2, foxa3, shhb, gli1/2, nkx2.2/2.4) – floor-plate and ventral neural tube.  
• Eye/forebrain regulators (pax6, rx1/2/3, otx1/2, vsx1) – optic vesicle.  
• ECM/remodelling genes (col I/III/VI, mmp2/11/23) – morphogenesis of emerging organs.

Together, the cluster appears to underpin a “ventral organogenesis” programme that coordinates specification and morphogenesis of heart, vasculature, pancreas, optic structures and ventral neural tube/floor-plate.

4. Key transcription factors implied by motif enrichment  
Highly enriched motifs and mapped factors include:  
• FOX family (FoxA1/2/3, FoxF1/2, FoxG1, FOXK2) – pioneer activity and ventral endoderm/LPM identity.  
• HOX/PBX/MEIS code – anterior–posterior and limb/heart field patterning.  
• TBX factors (Tbx1, Tbx4/5, Tbx15/18/20) – cardiopharyngeal and fin-bud programs.  
• GATA4/5/6 – ventral mesoderm/endoderm and cardiac initiation.  
• PAX2/6/8 and RFX6 – optic cup/renal ducts and pancreatic endocrine lineages respectively.  
• GLI1/2/3 – Shh signalling read-out in floor-plate and optic stalk.  
• MEF2 & SRF – maturation of emerging muscle in somites/heart.  
• Nuclear receptors (RXR/RAR, NR2F/COUP-TF) – retinoid control of LPM and eye.

Taken together, peak-cluster 33_2 comprises enhancers that open progressively during 10–24 hpf in lateral-plate mesoderm, ventral foregut endoderm, and Shh-patterned mid-line neural tissue, driven chiefly by FOX, HOX/PBX, TBX, GATA, PAX/RFX and GLI transcription factors to orchestrate early organogenesis of heart, vasculature, pancreas, optic cup and floor-plate.
]

## Cluster 33_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 33_3 marks a set of regulatory elements that switch on as the eye primordium forms and remain active in proliferating retinal progenitors.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already elevated at the 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf) but rises further, reaching its maximum between 20- and 30-somite stages (≈19–24 hpf).  
   • This timing coincides with optic-vesicle invagination, optic-cup formation and the onset of neurogenesis in the retina.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • The highest signals are in the optic-cup lineage (optic_cup 0-30 somites: 27–30 vs. ∼15–20 in most other tissues).  
   • Moderate accessibility is seen in adjacent anterior neural tube derivatives (forebrain / telencephalon, diencephalon) and in generic “neural” pseudobulks, but is low in mesoderm, endoderm or muscle.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Associated genes include canonical retinal-progenitor markers and eye-field genes (vsx2/Chx10, vax1, rx/rax, lmx1a, crx, otx5, rorb, isl1, tfec, onecut family, barhl, pax7/8).  
   • Functional annotation therefore points to:  
     – Eye-field specification and optic-cup morphogenesis  
     – Maintenance and cell-cycle activity of retinal progenitors  
     – Early neuronal differentiation/axon guidance within the developing retina.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment together with the TF–motif map highlight several TF families that orchestrate this programme:  
   • Paired-homeobox / Pax: strong enrichment for Pax2/5/6/8 motifs (row 33 & 111) – key for optic-cup and retinal identity.  
   • Sox family (rows 1, 34, 35, 61, 63): Sox2/3/11/19, maintaining multipotent neural progenitors.  
   • Fox factors (rows 2, 3, 68, 107): Foxg1, FoxD/E/F sub-family – forebrain/optic-stalk patterning.  
   • Eye-field homeoboxes & Barx/Dlx/Barhl (rows 3-5, 25, 48, 70, 84): Rax/Rx, Vsx2, Lhx2, Barhl, Dlx – retinal progenitor and early neuron genes.  
   • E2F/MEF2/E2F-like (rows 6, 10, 13, 59): consistent with the high proliferative state of retinal progenitors.

Taken together, peak-cluster 33_3 demarcates enhancers active during 10–24 hpf specifically in optic-cup / retinal-progenitor cells and encodes a transcriptional network centred on Pax6/2/8, Sox2/3, Foxg1 and eye-field homeobox factors that drive early eye development and the expansion of neural retinal progenitors.
]

## Cluster 33_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 33_4 marks the canonical “myogenic” chromatin program that turns on as paraxial mesoderm segments into somites and begins fast-twitch muscle differentiation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already elevated at 0 somites (∼10 hpf) but climbs sharply, peaking at 10–15 somites (≈14-18 hpf).  
• It remains high through 20–30 somites (18–24 hpf), then slowly tapers – a profile typical of the somitogenesis-to-myotome transition.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest scores)  
• Fast-twitch skeletal muscle/myotome (fast_muscle: 50.3 at 10 somites).  
• Forming somites (somites cluster).  
• Presomitic mesoderm (PSM).  
• Neuromesodermal progenitors show moderate accessibility; most other germ-layer or neural derivatives are low.

3. Biological processes controlled  
Genes linked to this cluster are enriched for:  
• Myogenic regulatory cascade – myod1, myf5, myog, myf6, mef2 family, srfa/b.  
• Sarcomere and contractile machinery – tnni2b, tnnt3a, myh7b, actc1c, ckma, atp2a1/2.  
• Somite segmentation/axial patterning – tbx16 (tbx6 ortholog), her/hes, hox A/B/C genes, wnt/fgf components.  
• Fast-fiber specification & maturation – vgll2b/tead, tnc, unc45b, cavin4a, ca2+-handling genes.  
Thus the cluster encompasses enhancers that drive segmentation of paraxial mesoderm and rapid differentiation of fast skeletal muscle.

4. Key transcription factors driving the program  
Motif enrichment and gene co-expression point to:  
• Myogenic bHLH factors: Myod1, Myf5, Myog, Myf6 (highest motif z-scores in groups 41/42).  
• Mef2 family (groups 10 & 113) – activates structural muscle genes downstream of MRFs.  
• Tbx16/Tbx6 and Tbx18/20 – segmentation and early myotome identity (group 62).  
• SRF/TEAD/VGLL2 – cytoskeletal and fast-fiber maturation.  
• Pax3/7 and Runx1/3 – early dermomyotome and myotome patterning.  
Co-enrichment of Hox, Fox and NFAT motifs suggests integration of AP positional cues and Ca²⁺/calcineurin signalling during fibre maturation.

In sum, cluster 33_4 represents a temporally-restricted, muscle-specific enhancer set that turns on during early somitogenesis, is maximally accessible in nascent fast-twitch fibres, and is governed by the classic MRF–Mef2 myogenic transcriptional network together with Tbx segmentation factors and modulators of fibre-type maturation.
]

## Cluster 33_5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 33_5 marks an early mesendodermal programme that feeds directly into heart, blood-/endothelium and pancreas formation.  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises already at 0–5 somites (≈10–12 hpf), peaks 10–15 somites (≈14–18 hpf) and then progressively falls but remains detectable to 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
• Highest absolute values are seen at 10 somites (heart myocardium 69, endocrine-pancreas 38, haematopoietic vasculature 55).

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Heart myocardium / cardiomyocytes  
• Haemangioblasts & haematopoietic-/vascular endothelium  
• Endocrine pancreas primordium & general endoderm  
• Lateral-plate mesoderm derivatives (early ALPM)  
(Other tissues show only baseline ~15–25).

3. Regulatory/biological processes represented  
• Cardiac specification & chamber-myogenesis (nkx2.5, tbx5/20, hand2, gata5/6, mef2 family)  
• Haemato-endothelial specification & vasculogenesis (tal1, lmo2, etv2, fli1, flt1, pecam1)  
• Pancreatic/endoderm organ budding (pdx1, rfx6, hnf1/4, onecut1, gata4/6)  
• General mesendoderm patterning & anterior–posterior positional cues (pbx/meis/hoχ code, foxa/foxc, nr2f/COUP-TF)  

Together these peaks appear to be the shared early “heart-blood-pancreas” enhancer set opened in lateral-plate/endoderm progenitors before lineage segregation.

4. Predicted key transcription-factor drivers  
• GATA factors (Gata4/5/6 for heart/endoderm; Gata1/2/3 with Tal1 for blood)  
• ETS & TAL network: Etv2/Erg/Fli1 + Tal1/Lmo2 activate endothelial & blood genes  
• Cardiac TBX/NKX/Hand/Mef2 axis (Tbx5/20, Nkx2-5/2-7, Hand2, Mef2a/c/d)  
• Endoderm/pancreas FOXA/FOXC & PDX1/RFX6/Onecut1  
• PBX/MEIS + HOX provide segmental identity  
• NR2F2/COUP-TF & nuclear receptors (RXR, RAR) contribute retinoid responsiveness typical of cardiac–pancreatic fields.

In summary, cluster 33_5 represents a temporally restricted enhancer module that is maximally open during 10–15-somite stages in cells that will give rise to the heart, blood/endothelium and endocrine pancreas, driven by a GATA–ETS/TAL–TBX/NKX–FOXA/PDX1 transcription-factor ensemble.
]

## Cluster 33_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 33_6 corresponds to a large set of promoter-like regions that remain open in almost every cell, but its accessibility is clearly highest in the nascent eye field / optic cup lineage.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0–5-somite stages and rises further by 10–15 somites, coinciding with optic-cup evagination (14–18 hpf).  
   • Values remain elevated until ~20 somites and then fall modestly by 30 somites, matching the transition from proliferative retinal progenitors to early differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Relative to the global baseline (~32–35), the strongest signals are seen in:  
   • neural_optic pseudobulks (41–46)  
   • optic-cup pseudobulks (41–46)  
   • eye-field-rich neural posterior / forebrain samples (mid 30s → low 40s).  
   Other tissues hover near baseline and tail-bud/epidermis drop to the high-20s, confirming optic selectivity.

3. Regulatory program inferred  
   Gene list is dominated by canonical eye/retina factors (pax6a/b, rx1/2/3, six3/6/7, otx1/2, vsx1/2, crx, nr2e1, nr2f2, meis1/2, lhx2, hmx1/2, tbx2/3, maf/nrl, etc.) plus phototransduction or cilia genes (otop1, pde6g, guca1c, rsph1). GO/pathway terms therefore point to:  
   • eye-field specification and anterior neuroectoderm patterning  
   • proliferation of retinal progenitor cells  
   • onset of photoreceptor and interneuron differentiation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment (and motif-gene mapping) highlight:  
   • Pax family (Pax6, Pax2/3/5/8)  
   • Rx / Vsx (Rax, Vsx1/2)  
   • Six/Otx/Crx axis (Six3/6/7, Otx1/2, Crx)  
   • SoxB1 factors (Sox2/3) for progenitor maintenance  
   • Lhx2/9 and Meis/Pbx cofactors for anterior neural identity  
   • Nuclear receptors Nr2e1, Nr2f1/2, Nr1d/4 and photoreceptor regulators Nr2e3, Rorb for later retinal maturation.  

Together these data indicate that cluster 33_6 tags a core chromatin program that establishes and maintains eye-field / retinal identity from gastrulation through early organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 33_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 33_7 marks a developmental program centred on early eye/retina formation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises sharply between 5- and 10-somite stages (≈12–14 hpf), peaks at 10–15 somites (~14–17 hpf) and gradually declines after 20–30 somites (early organogenesis).  
• The same temporal profile is seen in all high-accessibility cell types, indicating a narrow developmental window when these cis-elements are most active.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest pseudobulk signal)  
• Optic cup / retinal progenitors: 82–88 (10–15 somites) – highest in the atlas.  
• Early trunk/somitic muscle and epidermis (reflecting shared Pax/Six enhancers) show moderate early peaks (45–57 at 0–5 somites) but fall quickly thereafter.  
• Enteric-neuron and floor-plate progenitors display a smaller, earlier peak (30–39 at 0–10 somites).  
Thus the cluster is most characteristic of the optic cup, with secondary activity in closely related neuro-ectodermal or paraxial tissues.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from linked genes  
Enriched genes include canonical eye-field/retinal regulators (rx1/2/3, vsx1, crx, otx1/2, six3/6, pax6a/b, lhx2, rorb), ECM/axon-guidance components (fn1a, col2a1b, slit3, robo1-3, sema3/4/5, nrp1/2) and signalling modulators (wnt11, bmp6, fgfr1b).  Together they point to:  
• Eye-field specification and optic-cup morphogenesis.  
• Proliferation and early neurogenesis of retinal progenitor cells.  
• Establishment of extracellular matrix and guidance cues for retinal ganglion-cell axons.

4. Key transcription factors driving the cluster  
Motif enrichment and gene co-linking highlight:  
• Eye-field core: Pax6, Six3/Six6, Rax (Rx1/2/3), Lhx2, Otx1/2.  
• Retinal progenitor maintenance / neurogenesis: Vsx1, Crx, Sox2/Sox3, E2F family (cell-cycle).  
• Cooperative cofactors: Meis/Pbx, Zic, Fox (Foxd3/Foxa), TEAD/YAP (tissue growth).  

Together these factors form the classic Pax-Six-Rx transcriptional network that initiates and sustains optic-cup identity, explaining the very high, temporally restricted accessibility in retinal tissues and the secondary activity in adjacent neuro-ectodermal domains.
]

## Cluster 33_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 33_8 corresponds to the “early–to–mid neurogenesis” programme

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is modest at 0 somites (≈10 hpf), rises sharply between 5 and 15 somites (≈12–17 hpf) and then plateaus at a high level through 20–30 somites (≈19–24 hpf).  
   • Thus the cluster turns on during the onset of neurogenesis and stays active into early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Differentiating neurons (all CNS compartments) – values climb from 32 → 58.  
   • Enteric / peripheral neurons (neural-crest derivatives).  
   • Floor-plate / neural floor-plate and spinal cord neurons.  
   • Most non-neural tissues remain at baseline (≈15–22), indicating strong neuronal selectivity.

3. Implied regulatory/biological programme  
   Gene list is enriched for:  
   – Proneural and differentiation factors (neurod1/2/6, atoh1, ascl1, neurog3).  
   – Axon-guidance and synapse genes (robo3, slit3, grin1a, sv2a, slc17a6b, ret, nptn, nrxn1/2).  
   – Ion-channel and neurotransmitter machinery (cacna1, kcn family, gad2).  
   – Enteric-neuron markers (ret, phox2a/b, dcc).  
   – Cytoskeleton/neurite outgrowth components (dock, map3k, ank2, cntn2).  
   Together these peaks mark enhancers/promoters that drive neuronal fate commitment, neurite extension and early circuit assembly, including specification of enteric and cranial motor lineages.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + expressed genes)  
   • Sox family – Sox2/3 (maintenance of neuro-epithelial identity) and Sox4/11 (neuronal differentiation).  
   • Proneural bHLH – Atoh1, Neurog, Ascl1, Neurod1/4/6 (initiate neuronal gene cascades).  
   • Lhx / Phox2 / Pax6, Pax3/7 – regional neuronal subtype specification (hindbrain, spinal cord, enteric).  
   • MEF2 (Mef2a/b/c/d) – maturation and activity-dependent neuronal genes.  
   • Ebf (Ebf2/3) and Ets (Etv/Elf/Fli) factors – axon guidance and synaptogenesis.  
   These TFs together explain the steep temporal activation (proneural → differentiation) and the neuron-restricted accessibility pattern seen in cluster 33_8.

## Cluster 34_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 34_0 highlights the regulatory landscape that “switches on” as zebrafish embryos leave early segmentation and enter the 10–30-somite window (≈14–24 hpf), when large numbers of trunk neural-crest and posterior axial progenitors proliferate, delaminate and migrate.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• 0–5 somites: only moderate accessibility.  
• 10 somites: signal begins to rise.  
• 15–20 somites: sharp surge – highest values observed in the whole atlas.  
• 24 hpf (30 somites): still high, but already starting to taper.  
→ The cluster is therefore most active during mid- to late-somitogenesis (≈16–22 hpf).

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest accessibility is seen in:  
• Neural-crest derivatives – especially trunk/cranial NC at 10–30 somites (scores 15-42!).  
• Posterior tail-bud & presomitic mesoderm.  
• Early notochord and hatching-gland cells show a transient pulse.  
Somites, differentiating neurons and endoderm display only modest enrichment.  
→ The pattern fits regulatory elements shared by migratory neural-crest cells and posterior axial progenitors.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Associated genes are enriched for:  
• ECM & adhesion: col18a1a, col27a1b, sdc2, loxl1, serpinh2, itga8/9.  
• Rho/Rac cytoskeleton modulators: daam1a, rock2b, prex1, acap3b, sipA1.  
• Guidance / motility receptors: robo1, mcamb, igsf11.  
• TGF-β & RA signalling: tgfbr1a, tgfbr3, raraa.  
• Cell-cycle/proliferation: mybl2a, kdm5bb, tns1b, trib1.  
These functions collectively underpin epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, extensive migration, proliferation and early chondrogenic differentiation of neural-crest mesenchyme, as well as posterior body-axis elongation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment and TF–motif mapping point to a coherent NC/posterior programme:  
• SoxE/SoxB group: Sox10, Sox9, Sox8, Sox5, Sox2/3 – core neural-crest and progenitor factors.  
• Forkhead family: FoxD3, FoxC1/C2, Foxi1/3 & FoxK1/2 – EMT and migratory competence.  
• Pax3/7 & Pax2/8 – specify trunk NC and dorsal neural tube.  
• PBX/MEIS-HOX modules – confer rostro-caudal identity to migrating NC streams.  
• MSX/DLX/Barx/Lhx – early chondrogenic and craniofacial patterning regulators.  
• E2F/FOXM1 – reinforce the proliferative burst.  
• RUNX & TFAP2 family sites are present but less dominant, consistent with later skeletal lineage commitment.

In sum, peak-cluster 34_0 marks enhancers that become highly accessible in migratory neural-crest and tail-bud cells during mid-somitogenesis, orchestrating an EMT/migration-centred transcriptional programme driven by Sox–Fox–Pax–HOX networks and preparing cells for craniofacial cartilage formation and continued posterior axis extension.

## Cluster 34_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 34_1 captures the cis-regulatory program that turns on when trunk/cranial neural-crest cells leave the neural tube and begin migrating and differentiating (≈ 12–20 hpf).

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility rises sharply between 5- and 10-somite stages (~12–14 hpf).  
   • It reaches a maximum at 15–20 somites (~16–19 hpf) and declines by 30 somites.  
   → The pattern fits the window of neural-crest delamination, migration and early fate commitment.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Neural-crest lineage – strongest in neural_crest pseudobulks (10-20 somites: 40–47 logCPM).  
   • Moderate signal in premigratory neural plate border (neural_crest_5 s) and in somitic/fast-muscle pseudobulks, reflecting shared border/mesenchymal programs but at lower amplitude.  
   • Negligible in endoderm, epidermis, brain, etc.

3. Biological processes represented  
   Gene set points to classic neural-crest and early pigment-cell functions:  
   • Specification & EMT: sox10, foxd3, prrx1a/b, zeb2a, pdgfra, lef1, msx/dlx/hoxa/b genes.  
   • Migration / ECM remodelling: adam12, loxl2a, pxdn, thbs2a, col27a1b, sulf1.  
   • Melanophore differentiation & melanosome biology: mitfa-targets tyr, slc24a5, slc45a2, abca1a.  
   • Wnt/TGFβ/PDGF and retinoic-acid signalling components (rxraa, tgfbr3, cyp26b1).  
   Overall, the cluster marks the transition from neural-crest progenitor to early migratory and pigment-cell states.

4. Likely driving transcription factors  
   Motif enrichment plus gene list highlight a canonical neural-crest TF ensemble:  
   • SOX-E / SOX-F: Sox10, Sox9/8/6 – strong SOX motif over-representation.  
   • FOX family: FoxD3 (neural-crest pioneer), FoxC1/C2, FoxK, FoxP – FOX motifs enriched.  
   • PAX3/7 & MSX/DLX homeobox factors – border‐specification motifs present.  
   • MITF-/TFE-family (Mitfa, Tfec, Tfe3) and CREB/ATF bZIPs – drive pigment-cell and stress-responsive genes.  
   • TFAP2, LEF/TCF and HOX motifs furnish Wnt-response and axial identity inputs.  

In sum, peak-cluster 34_1 represents the chromatin module that becomes accessible specifically in developing neural-crest cells during their peak migratory/early differentiation phase and is orchestrated by SOX-FOX-PAX/HOX core TFs together with pigment-cell-specific bZIP factors.

## Cluster 34_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 34_2 corresponds to the canonical “neural-crest” chromatin programme that is switched on soon after neurulation, peaks while the crest is delaminating and migrating, and is already tapering as derivatives begin to differentiate.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility already exceeds background at the 5-somite stage, surges at 10–20 somites (≈14–19 hpf) where values reach 30-fold above baseline, and falls back by 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • This trajectory matches the specification-to-migration window of zebrafish neural-crest cells.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Neural-crest clusters (premigratory and migratory) – strongest signal (5 s: 12.5; 10 s: 29.3; 15 s: 32.8; 20 s: 32.9).  
   • Minor but noticeable signal in early paraxial muscle (5–10 s) and optic-cup/neural-tube compartments, reflecting shared dorsal/crest enhancers.  
   • Virtually baseline levels (< 6) in endoderm, mesodermal lpm, blood or epidermis.

3. Biological processes likely regulated  
   Gene list is enriched for:  
   • Neural-crest specification & EMT: sox10, sox9a/b, foxd3, zeb2a, snai genes, tfec.  
   • Migration/ECM remodelling: adamts5/8, col4a2, sulf2a, itga9/itgb8, plxna/sema genes.  
   • Axon-guidance / peripheral-neuron differentiation: cntn5, cntnap2a/5b, nrxn2a, efna3b, sdk2b, sema4ab/6e, dab1, npas3.  
   • Glial / melanophore lineage priming: tfeb, tfec, mitf-family targets (ug t8, sox10).  
   • Cell-cycle and chromatin factors (e2f, hdac4) consistent with the proliferative state of migrating crest.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene presence)  
   • SoxE group – Sox10, Sox9, Sox8 (highest motif z-scores, expressed genes).  
   • Pax3/7 and Msx1/2 – dorsal neural-tube/crest inducers.  
   • Fox factors – FoxD3/FoxI/FoxK; FoxD3 is a master neural-crest specifier.  
   • TFEC/TFEB/MITF family – pigment-cell / neural-crest lineage bias.  
   • Lhx, Uncx, Barx, Lbx, Dlx and other homeobox factors marking early cranial and trunk crest sub-lineages.  
   • AP-2 (tfap2 family) and Snai/Zeb factors that drive EMT.  
   • E2F and Myc-related motifs support the proliferative burst during migration.

Taken together, cluster 34_2 demarcates enhancer elements that orchestrate neural-crest specification, EMT, migration and early peripheral-neuron/pigment-cell differentiation, with maximal activity in trunk neural-crest cells between 10 and 20 somites.
]

## Cluster 34_3

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 34_3 corresponds to the “neural-crest specification / early-migration” program operating during mid-somitogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility rises already at the 0–5-somite stages but then surges (∼4- to 6-fold) between 5 and 15 somites, peaking at 10–15 somites (≈14-18 hpf).  
• Accessibility gradually wanes after 20 somites yet remains above baseline in neural-crest derivatives (enteric neurons, peripheral neurons) at 24 hpf.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest mean accessibility)  
• Neural crest (premigratory 5 som, migratory 10–20 som; max ≈ 41–43)  
• Generic neural plate / posterior neural tube (“neural_*” columns)  
• Early peripheral / enteric neurons  
• Minor but noticeable signal in NMPs and hindbrain, consistent with the neural-crest border domain.

3. Regulated biological processes / pathways  
The associated gene set is a textbook neural-crest module:  
• Specification & EMT: sox10, sox9a/b, pax3a/b, foxd3, tfap2-family (motifs), bcl11ab, snai, zeb genes.  
• Migration & guidance: slit1b-robo1, ednrab, kirrel3, agrn, adamts10, pdgfbb, gpc5a.  
• Cytoskeleton / motility: flnb, diaph2, myo18ab, myo1d.  
• Early lineage bias – pigment / skeletal / neuron: tfec, mitf-motif (TFE family), alx1, gpnmb, b3gat1, prom1a, ndst genes, stmn4.  
Together they define the transition from neural-plate border to migratory trunk neural-crest and the first differentiation of peripheral/enteric neurons and pigment-precursors.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + expressed genes)  
• SoxE / SoxF family – strong SOX motif (Sox10, Sox9, Sox8, Sox5).  
• Pax3/7 – PAX motif cluster (#7, #33) matches high pax3a/b expression.  
• FoxD3 / Fox family – broad FOX motif set (#2, #68); foxd3, foxi, foxc, foxg genes present.  
• TFEC / MITF sub-family (MiT-TFE motif, list #14) – matches tfec gene in set; seeds pigment lineage.  
• TFAP2, ETS (Fli/Etv), EGR/KLF and E2F motifs contribute to EMT, migration and proliferative expansion.

Taken together, peak cluster 34_3 marks enhancers that become maximally open in premigratory and early-migratory neural-crest cells during 10–15 somite stages, orchestrating neural-crest EMT, migration and early peripheral-neuron/pigment differentiation via a Sox10-Pax3/FoxD3-TFEC-centred transcriptional network.

## Cluster 34_4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 34_4 marks a developmentally “early-neuroectoderm + midline” program.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at the 0-somite stage, rises steeply at 5-10 somites and reaches a maximum around 10-15 somites (≈ 13-18 hpf).  
   • Signal diminishes afterwards but remains above background up to 24 hpf (30 somites), indicating a role that is initiated during segmentation and tapers during early organogenesis.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest average accessibility)  
   • Optic cup / retinal progenitors  54–57 (10–15 som)  
   • Notochord           29–24 (5–10 som)  
   • Enteric-neuron lineage     16–17 (all somite stages)  
   • Early epidermis & differentiating neurons show moderate but broad accessibility.  
   Thus the cluster is most open in axial midline tissue (notochord) at the onset of segmentation and, slightly later, in anterior neuroectoderm derivatives – especially the eye field – together with neural-crest-derived enteric neurons.

3. Regulatory programme implied  
   • Patterning of the axial midline (notochord) and ventral neural tube – Hedgehog/Gli axis (gli2a, foxa2, noto).  
   • Specification of the eye field/optic cup and anterior forebrain – eye-field transcription network (rx1/2/3, pax6a/b, six3/6, otx).  
   • Early neural-crest differentiation and peripheral neuron wiring (sox10, mitfa, cntn2, ntrk3a, s100b, pcdh genes).  
   • Extracellular matrix remodelling and axon guidance (adamts5, robo1, spon1a, tenm2).  
   Collectively, peaks in 34_4 appear to coordinate chromatin states required for establishing anterior neural plate identities, notochord-mediated ventralisation and the emergence of neural-crest-derived enteric neurons.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched and genes present)  
   • SOX family – Sox2/3/5/9/10/11: pluripotent neuroectoderm & neural crest competence.  
   • FOXA/FoxD/FoxG/FoxI – midline and forebrain patterning; Foxa2 partners with Gli for notochord-mediated Shh signalling.  
   • PAX & RAX/RX (Pax6, Pax7, Rx1/2/3) – eye-field and dorsal/anterior neural specification.  
   • HOX / PBX / MEIS – rostro-caudal patterning signals coincident with notochord activity.  
   • GLI2 – mediates Hedgehog output from notochord.  
   • LHX, DLX, MSX and BARHL families – neuronal subtype and cranial neural-crest programmes.  

Taken together, peak-cluster 34_4 represents an enhancer cohort that is transiently unlocked during segmentation to drive gene networks required for (i) notochord formation/ventral patterning, (ii) eye-field and anterior neural plate specification, and (iii) early neural-crest/enteric-neuron differentiation.

## Cluster 35_0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 35_0 captures a neuro-ectoderm/axial mid-line chromatin program that turns on shortly after gastrulation and ramps up through early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already detectable at 0-somite (10 hpf) but rises steadily with each stage, reaching its maximum between 20- and 30-somites (≈22-24 hpf).  
   • The monotonic increase parallels the onset of robust neurogenesis and ventral mid-line maturation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signal)  
   • Neural floor-plate (6.9 → 11.3 log-counts from 0- to 20-somite).  
   • Tail-bud / posterior axial progenitors (8.7 → 14.5).  
   • Notochord and spinal-cord ventral neurons (≈5–6).  
   • Significant, but lower, accessibility in early differentiating neurons and neural-crest cells (≈4–5).  
   → Together these point to ventral CNS and posterior axial progenitors as the principal cell sources.

3. Biological processes likely regulated  
   • Mid-line patterning and A–P positional identity (HOX/UNCX, ROR, PBX motifs; genes hox cluster, unc5da, rasgrf2a).  
   • Neural progenitor maintenance → neurogenic differentiation (SOX2/3/19, SOX11/21; genes npas3, nbeaa, magi3, grm7).  
   • Axon guidance / synaptogenesis (pcdh11, sdk2b, ctnna2, adgrl1a, camsap3, tgfb pathway components).  
   • Posterior body elongation and notochord/floor-plate signaling (tail-bud enrichment; genes nrg1/3, rorab, tfeb).  
   In sum, the cluster marks cis-regulatory elements that coordinate ventral spinal cord and notochord maturation while simultaneously launching neuronal wiring programs.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + gene co-expression)  
   • SOX family – SOX2/SOX3 (progenitors), SOX11/21/SOX5 (neuronal differentiation), SOX19 (early neural plate).  
   • FOX factors – FOXD3/FOXF2/FOXG1 for neural plate border & forebrain/posterior identity; FOXA2 typical of floor-plate.  
   • HOX/PBX/MEIS code – imparts rostro-caudal positional information in the spinal cord and tail-bud.  
   • ROR (RORA/B) nuclear receptors – present in both motif list and RNA, linked to mid-line neuronal development.  
   • E2F/FOXM1 – cell-cycle-related motifs reflecting proliferative neural progenitors in tail-bud and floor-plate.  
   • MEF2/NeuroD/ATOH/TCF clusters appear at later stages, consistent with the rise in differentiating neuronal sub-types.

Overall, peak-cluster 35_0 delineates a temporally escalating, SOX–FOX–HOX driven regulatory landscape that is most active in ventral mid-line / posterior neural progenitors and underlies their transition into mature, axon-connecting neurons during early zebrafish organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 35_1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 35_1 represents a surface-ectoderm / early axial “Sox-module”

1. Temporal dynamics  
• First becomes accessible at the 0-somite stage (~10 hpf) and is already very high (notably the huge signal in the 0-somite notochord sample).  
• Accessibility stays high through the 5–20-somite stages (≈12–20 hpf) and peaks between 10- and 15-somites, then falls markedly by 30-somites (≈24 hpf).  
→ The cluster is most active during late gastrulation to mid-segmentation, i.e. the window when the surface ectoderm is being specified and the notochord sheath is maturing.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest mean accessibility is seen in:  
• Epidermis / surface ectoderm (9–12 log-counts at every sampled stage).  
• Early notochord (0-somite value ≈ 39; falls to background afterwards).  
Moderate but significant signal is detected in lateral plate mesoderm, neural crest and generic “neural” ectoderm, but these are an order of magnitude lower than in epidermis.  
→ Cluster 35_1 marks chromatin that is characteristic of the superficial epithelial sheet and, transiently, the emerging notochord.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
The peaks sit near – or are highly correlated with – genes encoding:  
• Basal-layer / epithelial TFs and markers: tp63, zeb2a, klf4, tead1b.  
• Extracellular-matrix and adhesion components: lama5, col14a1a, emilin1b, fbn2b, itga3/6, adam12/28, adamts6, tgfb3.  
• Secreted signalling factors involved in ectoderm and axial morphogenesis: wnt9a, fgf24, tgfb3.  
These genes point to programmes that build the basement membrane, strengthen cell–matrix contacts and remodel ECM during spreading and fusion of epithelia, while tuning Wnt/TGFβ signalling during body-axis induction.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
Motif enrichment for this cluster is dominated by the Sox family (row 35/61 of the motif-to-factor table): Sox2/3/19 (early ectoderm), Sox5/6 (periderm), Sox9/10/8 (neural-crest/epidermal derivatives). Additional enriched/expressed regulators that fit the biology:  
• TP63 – master regulator of zebrafish epidermal stratification.  
• TEAD1/TEAD3 (Hippo pathway) – cooperate with p63 in basal-layer cells.  
• KLF family (Klf4/6/17) – epidermal differentiation and barrier genes.  
• AP-1 components (Fos/Jun/Jdp2) – ECM remodelling & wound-like gene set.  
Together these TFs explain both the strong epidermal accessibility and the transient early activity in axial mid-line cells.

Summary: Peak-cluster 35_1 captures a Sox-centric regulatory module that drives epithelial/basement-membrane gene expression in the zebrafish surface ectoderm, with an early spike in the nascent notochord, peaking around 10–15 somites and diminishing by early organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 35_2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 35_2 is a short-lived, eye-field–specific burst of chromatin accessibility that marks the very first steps of retinal development.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is negligible in gastrula (tail-bud) samples, shoots up at 0 somites (≈10 hpf) and remains very high at 5 somites (≈11–12 hpf).  
• By 10 somites (≈14 hpf) the signal has already collapsed to background levels and stays low thereafter.  
➔ The cluster therefore demarcates a ~2-hour window during late neurulation / early segmentation when the eye field is specified.

2. Cell-type specificity  
• An extreme spike is seen in optic-cup progenitors (optic_cup_0 s: 37.7; optic_cup_5 s: 29.2).  
• All other neural or non-neural lineages show only the basal ∼2.3-log signal.  
➔ The peaks are essentially restricted to the optic cup / early retinal neural plate.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
Gene-accessibility correlations are enriched for canonical eye-field and early retinal genes (rx1/2/3, six3/6, lhx2, pax6, vsx1, otx1/2, crx, foxe3, tbx3/5, sox2/3, etc.) together with neuronal adhesion and axon-guidance genes (ctnna2, robo1/2, slit3, unc5c) and cell-cycle drivers (e2f, foxm1).  
➔ The cluster corresponds to the transcriptional programme that:  
   • specifies retinal progenitor identity,  
   • keeps them proliferative, and  
   • initiates neurogenic competence.

4. Key transcription factors (motif enrichment + mapping)  
Highly enriched motif families and their eye-field drivers:  
• Homeobox: Rx (Rax), Six3/6, Lhx2/9, Vsx1/2, Otx2, Crx.  
• Paired-box: Pax6, Pax2/8 (optic-stalk boundary).  
• HMG/Sox: Sox2/3/19b (pluripotent neural plate factors).  
• Forkhead: Foxg1, Foxe3, Foxd1/d3 (nasal–temporal patterning).  
• bHLH / E-box: NeuroD, Atoh7 (license later neurogenesis, already poised).  
• E2F/FOXM1 cluster (cell-cycle surge that accompanies optic-cup evagination).

Together, these factors form the classic eye-field gene–regulatory network (EFGRN). Their simultaneous motif enrichment and the razor-sharp temporal–spatial accessibility profile strongly indicate that peak-cluster 35_2 contains enhancers that orchestrate eye-field specification and the onset of retinal progenitor proliferation in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 35_3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 35_3 corresponds to a neuronal enhancer program that switches on as neurogenesis begins and reaches full strength during early organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is low at 0–5-somite stages (≈10–12 hpf), rises sharply by 10–15 somites and reaches its maximum at 20–30 somites (≈20–24 hpf).  

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest signals are in enteric neurons (log-accessibility ≈ 12–16) and in “differentiating_neurons” (≈ 6–10).  
   • Moderate but clear accessibility in other neural derivatives (neural tube, spinal cord, hindbrain, neural crest).  
   • Mesodermal, endodermal and muscle pseudobulks stay at background (~2), indicating a neuron-restricted profile.

3. Biological/functional program  
   Gene set is dominated by mature neuronal genes:  
   – Synaptic transmission and vesicle cycling (SNAP25a, SV2a, SYT7/10/14, CAMK2b1).  
   – Axon guidance / adhesion (ROBO1, CNTN3, TENM1/2, PCDH clusters, LHX/LBX cofactors).  
   – Electrical excitability (multiple CACNA, KCN, HCN4, PIEZO2, GRIA/GRM receptors).  
   – Enteric-neuron signature components (PHOX2-regulated genes, RET pathway partners e.g. NTN-related, GFRα).  
   Together these peaks mark enhancers required for terminal neuronal differentiation, neurite extension and onset of synaptic activity, with a particular bias toward autonomic/enteric lineages.

4. Likely transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and TF–motif mapping converge on:  
   • Sox family (SOX10, SOX2/3/11/21) – neural-crest & pan-neural enhancers.  
   • Phox2a/Phox2b, Lhx2/4/9, Lmx1 – core enteric / autonomic neuron regulators.  
   • Fox family (FOXD3, FOXG1, FOXP1/2/4) – neural crest maintenance and neuronal subtype specification.  
   • Dlx / Pax / Uncx homeodomain factors – regional patterning of early neurons.  
   • Runx3, MEF2, E2F auxiliary motifs – maturation, activity-dependent growth and cell-cycle exit.

In summary, cluster 35_3 captures a late-somite, neuron-restricted enhancer set orchestrated by Sox10/Fox/Phox2/Lhx networks to drive the final differentiation and functional maturation of central and especially enteric neurons in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 35_4

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 35-4 marks a secretory endoderm programme that comes on very early and is subsequently retained by specialised glandular derivatives.  

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is already very high at the 0-somite stage (tail-bud sample: 38 a.u.) and remains high through 10–15 somites.  
• Signal wanes in most tissues after ~20 somites, but stays elevated in the endocrine-pancreas pseudobulks up to 30 somites, indicating sustained use of the programme in maturing pancreatic cells.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Hatching gland (chorionase-secreting cells) – strongest signal of any cell type (14–20 a.u., 0–15 som).  
• Endocrine pancreas – 7–9 a.u. from 5 som onward.  
• General endoderm lineage pseudobulks (5–8 a.u.).  
• Early tail-bud tissue at 0 som (likely containing posterior endoderm progenitors).

3. Regulatory/biological programme  
Gene content (cadps2, rims1b, creb3l3a, tg, panx1b, pltp, furina, adam9, piezo2, il6, hk2, abcc3) and the cell-type pattern point to a “high-throughput secretory cell” module that equips endoderm-derived organs with:  
• ER/Golgi expansion and vesicle exocytosis machinery (CREB3L family, CADPS2, RIMS1, FURIN).  
• Membrane transporters and metabolic enzymes needed for hormone/enzyme production (ABCC3, HK2, HKDC1, SLC genes).  
• Extracellular matrix/adhesion remodelers important for organ budding (ADAM9, SLIT3, CDH13).  
This programme is used first by the hatching gland, then redeployed in endocrine pancreas and emerging thyroid/other fore-gut derivatives.

4. Key transcription factors inferred from motif enrichment  
• Sox endoderm factors – Sox17/32/3/19, Sox7/8; drive early endoderm identity and remain active in endocrine cells.  
• Fox pioneer factors – FoxA1/2, Foxf2/1, Foxd1/3/5; open endodermal chromatin and cooperate with Sox.  
• Gata4/5/6 and HNF family (Hnf4, Hnf1) – classical drivers of gut and pancreatic epithelial differentiation.  
• Pdx1 motif is present (from mapping lines), consistent with endocrine-pancreas specificity at later stages.  
• Nuclear receptors responding to retinoic acid / bile-acid ligands (RARs, RXRs, LXR/FXR subgroup) – match the strong enrichment of NR motifs (rows 11, 31, 32, 55, 57), fitting RA-dependent fore-gut organogenesis.  
• CREB/ATF/CREB3L family – regulators of ER and secretory pathway genes, explaining the secretory signature.

Taken together, peak cluster 35-4 delineates an early-activated, Sox/Fox/Gata-controlled cis-regulatory module that underpins secretory endoderm maturation, first surfacing in the hatching gland and persisting in the developing endocrine pancreas.

## Cluster 35_5

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 35_5 – concise interpretation

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Moderate accessibility at 0–5 somites (10–11 hpf).  
• Rises steadily through 10–20 somites and reaches maxima at 20–30 somites (≈18–24 hpf).  
→ The cluster is most active during early organogenesis, coincident with endothelial, hematopoietic and cardiac differentiation.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest pseudobulk signal)  
• Hematopoietic / vascular endothelium (hematopoietic-vasculature 15–30 som, hemangioblasts 10–30 som).  
• Heart myocardium (especially 20–30 som).  
• Lateral-plate mesoderm & somites (early) and fast/slow muscle.  
• Much lower or lost in neural crest, epidermis, NMPs by 30 som.  
→ The pattern pinpoints mesoderm-derived lineages that give rise to blood vessels, blood and heart.

3. Regulatory programme inferred from associated genes  
Enriched gene set: kdr/vegfr2, flt4, pdgfrb, ccbe1, esama, rasip1, cldn5b, fn1a, multiple collagens, nid1b, gfi1aa/b, gata-family targets, mef2a/c, myh7bb, tbx3/5, etc.  
Functions implied:  
• Angiogenesis & endothelial barrier formation (Vegf signalling, cell-adhesion/ECM genes).  
• Hemangioblast specification and early hematopoiesis (gfi1aa/b, spi1b).  
• Cardiac morphogenesis and contractile apparatus assembly (tbx5, mef2, myh7bb, myh9b).  
• Lateral-plate / somitic mesoderm patterning (hox clusters, foxf1, foxc, tbx genes).  
Overall, cluster 35_5 marks a chromatin programme that drives formation and maturation of the cardiovascular and hematopoietic systems.

4. Likely key transcription factors (motif enrichment + factor lists)  
• ETS family: Etv2, Fli1, Erg, Etv5 – canonical endothelial/hemangioblast drivers.  
• FOX family: FoxC1/C2, FoxF1/F2, FoxP1/4 – LPM and vascular enhancers.  
• SOX F & H sub-families: Sox17/18/7/9 – endothelial & endodermal cooperation.  
• GATA factors: Gata2/3/4/6 – blood and endocardial specification.  
• MEF2 & TBX (Mef2a/c/d, Tbx3/5/20) – cardiomyocyte differentiation.  
• KLF2/6, NR2F/COUP-TF, RXR/RAR nuclear receptors – flow response & vascular maturation.  
These TFs together can account for the late-mesoderm, endothelial and cardiac accessibility peak observed.

In summary, peak cluster 35_5 represents a developmental, mesoderm-biased regulatory module that becomes highly accessible during 15–30 somite stages in hemangioblast, endothelial, hematopoietic and cardiac cells, coordinating gene expression programmes necessary for vasculogenesis, hematopoiesis and early heart formation.

## Cluster 35_6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 35_6 represents a large set of regulatory elements that open early during segmentation and remain (or become even more) accessible in neural lineages as they start to differentiate.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0–15-somite stages (≈10–20 hpf) in most tissues.  
   • In many non-neural progenitor populations (e.g. NMPs, PSM, endoderm) the signal drops sharply by 30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • In neural lineages—especially “differentiating neurons” and regional CNS pseudobulks—accessibility is maintained and even peaks at 20–30 somites.  
   → The cluster marks an early-opening programme that is retained predominantly in maturing neural cells.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Differentiating neurons (hindbrain, spinal cord, optic/retinal, telencephalon).  
   • Neural progenitor states (neural plate, neural crest) and NMPs.  
   • Very transient, extreme accessibility in primordial germ cells at 0-somites (likely maternal/PGC enhancer carry-over) but negligible thereafter.  

3. Likely biological processes regulated  
   Gene set is highly enriched for neuronal wiring and synaptic function:  
   – Axon guidance / outgrowth (DOCK4, UNC13B, CNTNAP, ERBB4, NRG1/3, PIEZO2, ROBO-like/DSCAM genes).  
   – Synapse assembly and neurotransmission (SNAP25b, SV2, SHANK, RYR2, CACNA, GRIA/K/G, GABRB2, NPTX1, LRRTM/KIRREL/LRFN families).  
   – Cell-adhesion molecules that pattern neurites (CDH4/5/18, CNTNAPs, PCDHs, L1-CAM family).  
   – Calcium signalling and activity-dependent transcription (MEF2 targets, CAMK2, CREB-regulated genes).  
   Overall, the cluster encodes the gene battery needed for the transition from generic neural progenitor to electrically and chemically connected neuron.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and motif-to-factor mapping converge on:  
   • Sox pioneer family – Sox2/3/19 in progenitors; Sox11/4/6/21 and Sox10/9 in differentiating neural crest & neurons.  
   • Proneural bHLH factors – Atoh1/7, NeuroD1/4/6, Olig2 – promoting neurogenesis.  
   • MEF2 (mef2ca/cb/aa) – activity-dependent neuronal maturation.  
   • TCF/LEF (Wnt-responsive) and HOX/IRX patterning factors – regional identity cues.  
   • Supporting co-factors: PBX/MEIS and CREB/ATF family (activity and cAMP signalling).

Together these data indicate that peak-cluster 35_6 constitutes a Sox-centred, early-opening enhancer module that is progressively restricted to the nervous system and coordinates the genetic programme for neuronal differentiation, circuit formation and synaptic maturation during zebrafish organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 35_7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 35_7 represents a large set of regulatory regions that behave almost like “core” chromatin: they open very early (gastrulation; 0-somite stage), stay accessible throughout somitogenesis, and are still readily accessible by 30 somites (24 hpf).  Accessibility never collapses to background in most lineages, but two mesodermal compartments stand out:

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Already open in the earliest sample (0-somites).  
   • Remain stably open in most tissues all the way to 30-somites, with a small second rise in the mature posterior paraxial mesoderm (PSM_30-somites).  

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Early axial mesoderm (notochord, 0-somites).  
   • Posterior presomitic/paraxial mesoderm and forming somites (PSM_30-somites, Somites_30-somites).  
   • Also well-accessible in neuromesodermal progenitors, generic “neural” clusters and many trunk neural derivatives; weakest in epidermis / surface ectoderm and blood lineages.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   Associated gene set is enriched for:  
   • Extracellular-matrix and adhesion genes (col6a1, vcanb, hspg2, tenm2, unc5c, cdh23, adamts17) needed for building the trunk axis and guiding outgrowing axons.  
   • Axon guidance / synaptic maturation components (erbb4, grik3, gabrb2, nlgn1/2/4, chrnb2, fgf13a).  
   • Hox, Fox and Tbx genes that pattern the trunk.  
   ⇒ Together they point to an axial “neuromesodermal” programme: laying down the trunk scaffold (notochord & paraxial mesoderm) while simultaneously priming neuro‐ectodermal genes required for subsequent spinal-cord and peripheral-neuron differentiation.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment is dominated by pioneer-type SOX sites, with supporting FOX and HOX inputs:  
   • SOX family (Sox2/3/5/8/10/11/14/21, Sox19a/b) – fits early open chromatin in multipotent neural/mesoderm progenitors.  
   • FOX factors (FoxD1/3/5, FoxF1/2, FoxA) – cooperate with SOX in axial mesoderm and gut–mesoderm patterning.  
   • HOX class (broad trunk HoxA/B/C/D sets) – provide rostro-caudal positional information.  
   • E2F/FOX-M1 group – modest signal, consistent with the high proliferation rate of NMP/PSM cells.

In summary, peak-cluster 35_7 demarcates a constitutively open, SOX-centred regulatory module that is strongest in early notochord and later paraxial mesoderm, and that underlies the dual neuromesodermal programme of trunk patterning, ECM deposition and the earliest priming of spinal-neuron gene expression.
]

## Cluster 35_8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 35_8 is a large set of regulatory elements that behave like a “posterior‐progenitor/tail-bud” module that is briefly accessible in almost every lineage just after gastrulation, but fades as cells commit and the embryo enters organogenesis.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility is maximal at the bud / 0–5-somite stages (≈10–12 hpf).  
  – Tail-bud_0 som: 38 (>> any other sample).  
  – Most other cell types are 8–9 at 0 som and fall steadily to 6–7 by 20 som; many drop to ~1–2 by 30 som.  
• Thus the cluster represents an early, transient chromatin state that is shut down once segmentation and organ primordia are established.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
• Tail-bud progenitors (strong outlier).  
• Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs).  
• Pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM) and newly formed somites.  
• Early notochord and neural crest also show above-average values.  
• By contrast, differentiated tissues (endocrine pancreas, heart, epidermis, etc.) rapidly lose accessibility.

3. Implied regulatory programme / biology  
• Genes linked to the peaks are enriched for posterior-axis / trunk-extension functions:  
  – axial/mesodermal regulators: tbxtb (Brachyury), fgf10b, wnt5b, wnt6a, vegfc, cyp26c1, runx, hox A/B/C/D paralogs, fox, sox family members, lin28a.  
  – cell-cycle & proliferation drivers (E2F, FOXM1, MCM, etc.) consistent with the high mitotic activity of tail-bud stem cells.  
• Pathways: Wnt/β-catenin, FGF, RA, and Hox patterning required for continuous posterior body elongation and for maintaining multipotent tail-bud / NMP identity.

4. Key transcription-factor motifs enriched  
(High z-scores within the cluster)  
• SOX family (Sox2/3/19/21, etc.) – pluripotent and neuro-mesoderm progenitor factors.  
• FOX family (FoxD3/FoxA/FoxF/FoxK) – organizer and mesoderm patterning.  
• HOX / PBX / MEIS – confer positional identity along the A-P axis.  
• TBX / TBXT – core driver of posterior mesoderm.  
• TCF/LEF (Wnt effectors) and RAR/RXR (RA signalling) – fit the Wnt–RA gradient that patterns the tail.  
• E2F/FOXM1 – cell-cycle control of rapidly dividing progenitors.

In summary, peak-cluster 35_8 marks a brief, tail-bud–centred chromatin programme that maintains highly proliferative, posterior multipotent progenitors. As cells exit the tail-bud and commit to specific lineages, these regions close, explaining the sharp temporal decline in accessibility across virtually all differentiated cell types by the 20–30-somite stages.
]

## Cluster 35_9

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 35_9 captures a very broad, early-embryonic chromatin program that is most prominent in the posterior growth zone and neuro-mesodermal progenitors.

1. Temporal dynamics  
• Accessibility peaks at the first sampled stage (0-somite / ~10 hpf), drops sharply thereafter and returns to basal background by ~24 hpf (30 somites).  
• The outlier value (≈38) in tail-bud 0 somites, together with modest values (~5) in later stages, indicates a transient burst of accessibility during the onset of axis elongation.

2. Cell-type specificity  
Highest signal is seen in cell types that constitute or arise from the posterior progenitor field:  
• Tail-bud cells (0 somite)  
• Neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs)  
• Early presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and primitive neural tube / spinal-cord progenitors  
Other differentiated lineages show only baseline accessibility, suggesting this cluster marks multi-potent axial progenitors rather than mature tissues.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
The gene list and motif content point to pathways required for trunk/tail formation and early lineage priming:  
• Anterior-posterior patterning and HOX code activation (numerous Hox genes, retinoic-acid nuclear-receptor motifs).  
• Maintenance of pluripotency / bipotency of NMPs (SoxB1 family, FoxA/FoxD, T-box, Nkx).  
• Rapid proliferation of the growth zone (E2F/FOXM1 motifs – cell-cycle network).  
• Integration of Wnt/FGF (TCF/LEF motifs) and RA signalling (RAR/RXR, COUP-TF) that balance extension versus differentiation.  
Overall, the cluster represents an “axial progenitor / somitogenesis” chromatin module that keeps large sets of developmental genes in an accessible but transcriptionally poised state.

4. Key transcription factors predicted to drive the cluster  
Motif enrichment and factor mapping highlight:  
• SOX family: Sox19b/2/3/10/5 – maintain progenitor identity.  
• FOX family: Foxa/foxf/d/i – endow competence for both neural and mesodermal fates.  
• HOX factors (Hoxb1‐Hoxd11) in combination with RAR/RXR and COUP-TF (Nr2f1/2) – set positional identity along the A-P axis.  
• TCF/LEF (Tcf7l1/2) – read out Wnt signalling that sustains NMP proliferation.  
• E2F/FOXM1 – drive the high cell-cycle activity of the tail-bud.  

Together these TFs explain the transient, tail-bud-centred accessibility surge and link cluster 35_9 to early trunk/tail patterning and neuro-mesodermal progenitor maintenance.
]

## Cluster 35_10

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 35_10 marks a tail-bud/Post-gastrula progenitor programme.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility peaks at the beginning of somitogenesis (0-10 somites ≈10–14 hpf).  
   • Signal drops steadily after ∼15 somites and is almost absent by 30 somites (24 hpf).  
   → The elements are used during the short window when the posterior body axis is being generated.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Tail-bud progenitors (37.7 at 0 s, 36.3 at 10 s; dominant signal)  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) and early presomitic mesoderm (PSM) show moderately elevated values (2.6–2.9).  
   • Other embryonic tissues remain at basal levels (~2.3–2.5).  
   → The cluster is essentially restricted to the posterior growth zone and its immediate derivatives.

3. Likely biological functions / pathways  
   • Maintenance of NMP identity and posterior axial elongation.  
   • On-going segmentation (PSM → somites) and early paraxial muscle initiation.  
   • Patterning of caudal neural tube/notochord.  
   Supporting evidence: associated gene list is enriched for posterior Hox genes, segmentation factors (Cdx, Mesp-like, Uncx), cytoskeleton/axon-guidance genes (Robo1, Ntn receptors) and metabolic genes typical of rapidly dividing progenitors.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment and TF mapping point to:  
   • Sox family (Sox2/3/19/21/10/6) – core regulators of NMPs.  
   • Fox family (FoxA/FoxD/FoxF) – tail-bud progenitor and mesoderm enhancers.  
   • T-box / Brachyury (ta) and other TBX factors – axial elongation.  
   • Cdx/Hox code – posterior identity specification.  
   • TCF/Lef (Wnt effector), E2F & Myc modules – consistent with high proliferation.  

Together, peak cluster 35_10 represents cis-regulatory elements that are transiently and specifically opened in the posterior growth zone to drive the Sox-Fox-Tbx/Hox transcriptional network required for continued body-axis extension during early somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 35_11

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 35_11 can be best understood as an “early-eye/optic-cup” regulatory module.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at the very first sampled stage (0-somite, ~10 hpf), peaks again around 15 somites (~18 hpf) and drops sharply by 30 somites (~24 hpf).  
   • This timing matches the period when the eye field is specified, the optic vesicle evaginates and folds into the optic cup.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • The strongest chromatin signal is in optic-cup cells (37–48 a.u. at 0- and 15-somites, versus ~2–3 a.u. elsewhere).  
   • Moderate but consistent accessibility is also seen in adjacent anterior neuro-ectoderm (hindbrain / midbrain-hindbrain boundary, floor-plate, neural tube) – tissues that share early eye-field TFs – but is low in mesodermal or endodermal lineages.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   a. Eye-field and retinal progenitor identity  
      – Motif catalogue is dominated by SOX, PAX, SIX, RAX/RX, VSX, LHX, IRX and FOX sites, the canonical network that specifies retinal progenitors.  
      – Associated genes include rx1/2/3, vsx1, crx, otx1/2/5, pax6, lhx2/9, six3/6, impg1a, gucy2d, fgf-/tgf-receptors, many protocadherins and ECM genes (fras1, hmcn1, fbn2a, tnc), all characteristic of the optic cup neuro-epithelium and its morphogenesis.

   b. Extracellular-matrix remodelling and epithelial morphogenesis  
      – Enriched ECM/adhesion genes (TNC, TENM2, FRAS1, COL-/FBN-family, cadherins) and RUNX/SMAD/E2F motifs point to concurrent control of basement-membrane remodelling, proliferation and invagination of the optic cup.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   • Core eye-field TFs: Rx3, Pax6a/b, Six3/6, Lhx2, Vsx1/2, Sox2/3/19, Otx2, Irx3/5.  
   • Supporting regulators: Foxg1, Foxi1/2, FoxK1/2 (Fox motifs enriched), E2F family (proliferating retinal progenitors), Runx2/3 and Smad motifs (matrix and signalling integration).  

Taken together, peak cluster 35_11 marks enhancers that turn on specifically in early optic-cup progenitors, orchestrating retinal-field specification, proliferation and the ECM/adhesion changes required for optic-cup morphogenesis, then are silenced as differentiated retinal cell types begin to appear after ~24 hpf.
]

## Cluster 35_12

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 35_12 captures a chromatin program that is shared by posterior, still-multipotent embryonic cells and is progressively shut down as they commit to differentiated fates.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is maximal at the earliest stages we assayed (0–5-somite embryos, 10–12 hpf).  
   • It drops steadily after the 10-somite stage and is minimal by 25–30 somites (≈24 hpf).  
   • A single extreme value in Tail-bud 0 somite (37.7) emphasises a very transient, tail-bud-specific burst.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest signals)  
   • Tail-bud / axial stem-cell compartment  
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs)  
   • Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and early Somites  
   • Posterior Neural tube / Spinal cord and Floor-plate  
   • Early Neural-crest cells  
   Much lower accessibility is seen in differentiated tissues (endoderm, epidermis, pancreas, heart, late muscle), confirming specificity for undifferentiated posterior lineages.

3. Regulatory programme inferred  
   • Posterior body-axis extension and segmentation (Wnt/FGF, Notch clock, Hox patterning)  
   • Maintenance of bipotent NMP identity (simultaneous neural and mesodermal gene sets)  
   • On-set of trunk neural specification and neural-crest induction  
   • High cell-cycle/replication demand of stem-cell pool (E2F, Mcm, etc. among associated genes)  
   • Extracellular-matrix remodelling and EMT-related genes (ADAMs, ADAMTS, Sema, Angptl2) consistent with migratory behaviour of tail-bud and crest cells.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motifs highly enriched)  
   • Sox family (Sox2/3/19 for pluripotent neural progenitors; Sox10/9/6 for neural crest) – motif groups 1, 35, 61, 63, 67  
   • Fox factors (FoxD3/D5, FoxA, FoxF/G1) – motif groups 2–5, 68  
   • Hox/Pbx/Meis stripes (antero-posterior positional code) – motif groups 3–5, 25, 70, 72  
   • Pax & Irx pairs (neural plate border / spinal cord) – motif groups 7, 23, 33, 54, 73  
   • E2F/MYB/CTCF clusters (proliferation, architectural loops) – groups 6, 13, 59, 76  
   • TCF/LEF and T-box (Ta/Tbx16/18/20) motifs support Wnt-dependent axial stem-cell activity (groups 41, 60, 62).

Together, these features indicate that peak-cluster 35_12 marks enhancers that are opened specifically in posterior neuromesodermal and tail-bud progenitors to coordinate axis elongation, segmentation and early trunk neural/crest development, and that they are silenced once cells exit this progenitor state during early organogenesis.
]

## Cluster 35_13

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 35_13 highlights an enhancer set that is tightly linked to cranial-neural-crest–derived pharyngeal-arch development.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is very low in most stages but spikes twice:  
     – 0-somite stage (≈10 hpf): first appearance of premigratory cranial neural-crest cells.  
     – 20-somite stage (≈19–21 hpf): when neural-crest mesenchyme populates the pharyngeal arches and initiates chondrogenic differentiation.  
   • Minimal accessibility at 5–15 somites suggests a transient shutdown during neural-crest migration, with re-opening once cells reach the arches.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   • Extraordinary accessibility (37.7-fold over background at 0 somites, 23-fold at 20 somites) is confined to the pharyngeal-arches pseudobulk.  
   • All other cell types hover around basal values (~1.5), indicating that these peaks are essentially pharyngeal-arch-specific.

3. Underlying regulatory program / biology  
   • Associated genes are rich in extracellular-matrix components and remodelers (ADAMTS, COL4, FREM2, CRAT, PLPP4), signalling modulators (DKK2, VEGFC, EDNRAA, PTH1R), and chondrogenic / osteogenic regulators (RUNX3, DLX, MSX, SOX9, POSTNB).  
   • These functions converge on:  
     – Cranial neural-crest migration and condensation in the arches.  
     – Patterning along the antero-posterior (HOX code) and dorso-ventral (DLX/MSX code) axes.  
     – Onset of cartilage / bone matrix production.  
   • Thus the peak set likely marks enhancers driving early specification and later skeletal morphogenesis of the pharyngeal arches.

4. Key transcription factors inferred from motif enrichment  
   • HOX–PBX/MEIS complex (strong enrichment for multiple HOX, PBX1/3/4, MEIS1/2/3) – regional identity of individual arches.  
   • DLX, MSX, PRRX – ventral versus dorsal arch patterning.  
   • SOX10/9/6/8 and RUNX3 – neural-crest identity and chondrogenic differentiation.  
   • FOXC1/2 and TWIST family – cranial-mesenchyme migration and EMT-like behaviour.  
   • GATA3/6 and TCF/LEF sites – integration of endodermal/mesodermal signalling and Wnt input.

Taken together, peak cluster 35_13 represents a pharyngeal-arch enhancer module that turns on in cranial neural-crest cells as soon as they are specified, re-opens when they settle in the arches, and is orchestrated by a HOX/PBX-DLX/MSX-SOX regulatory cassette to drive craniofacial skeletal patterning.
]

## Cluster 35_14

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 35_14 represents a large set of cis-elements that are preferentially bound by Sox-family transcription factors and are opened very early in the posterior progenitor field of the embryo.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is maximal at the earliest sampled stage (0-somite / 10 hpf).  
     – Tail-bud_0 somites shows an exceptional signal (≈38-fold above background).  
   • Signal gradually tapers through somitogenesis but a modest “second bump” is seen around 20 somites (especially in tail-bud and migrating neural-crest derivatives).  
   • By 30 somites the cluster is largely closed in most lineages.

2. Cell-type specificity  
   Highest accessibility ranks:  
   1. Tail-bud progenitors / axial stem cells (NMPs, posterior PSM).  
   2. Neural-crest lineages (neural_crest 15–20 somites, enteric-neurons 20 somites).  
   3. Early neuro-epithelial cells and generic neural progenitors (neural / differentiating_neurons).  
   4. Secondary signal in diverse mesodermal progenitors (lateral plate, early heart, endoderm) but at lower amplitude.

3. Underlying regulatory programme  
   The associated gene list is strongly enriched for:  
   • Sox-controlled neural/neural-crest factors (sox2/3/14/19, sox5/6/8/9/10, sox21).  
   • Posterior patterning and body-axis extension genes (multiple hox clusters, tbx, fox, nkx, cdx).  
   • Progenitor-maintenance and chromatin remodelers (kdm2, lin28, dnmt1, cxxc genes).  
   Together these point to a programme that keeps posterior axial stem cells and early neural-crest progenitors in a multipotent, rapidly proliferating state while the body axis elongates. When these cells exit the tail-bud and start lineage commitment (≈15–20 somites) the same elements are reused in neural-crest derivatives.

4. Key transcription-factor drivers  
   Motif enrichment is dominated by Sox consensus sites; the only direct factor listed for this cluster is kdm2ba (consistent with an open, CpG-rich environment) but the indirect list pinpoints:  
   • SoxB1 group: Sox2, Sox3, Sox19a/b – neural/embryonic stem-like state.  
   • SoxD/E group: Sox5/6 and Sox8/9/10 – chondro-neural-crest and glial trajectories.  
   • Sox21/14 – neural differentiation modulators.  
   Supporting but lower-rank motifs: Fox (Foxd3, Foxf2), Tcf/Lef (Wnt response), E2F (cell-cycle) – all typical of proliferative posterior progenitors.

In summary, peak cluster 35_14 demarcates Sox-responsive enhancers that are highly open in the tail-bud at gastrulation/early somitogenesis, remain accessible in posterior axial stem cells, and are redeployed during neural-crest formation and early neurogenesis, orchestrated chiefly by Sox family TFs with assistance from Fox and Wnt/Tcf factors.
]

## Cluster 35_15

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 35_15 marks the chromatin programme that drives posterior body-axis extension and early segmentation.

1. Temporal dynamics  
   • Accessibility is already high at 0-somite stage, rises further through 5-10 somites (peak values in PSM_10 som, Spinal cord_10 som ≈ 8.5–8.8) and starts to wane after 20 somites.  
   • By 30 somites (≈ 24 hpf) accessibility collapses in most posterior compartments (e.g. NMP_30 som ≈ 1, PSM_30 som ≈ 6.7), indicating shutdown once trunk elongation is complete.

2. Cell-type specificity (highest accessibility)  
   • Presomitic mesoderm (PSM)   
   • Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) / tail-bud  
   • Posterior spinal cord & generic “spinal_cord” pseudobulks  
   • Early forming fast-muscle / nascent somites (moderate)  
   Low in endodermal, epidermal, pancreatic, optic and most anterior neural lineages.

3. Implied biological programme  
   • Posterior axial progenitor maintenance and proliferation (Lin28a, Cdx, Wnt/Tcf targets).  
   • Hox-controlled antero-posterior patterning and rostro-caudal identity specification.  
   • Segmentation clock & somite maturation (Notch/Rbpj, Mesp-like, Tbx16).  
   • Transition of NMPs into paraxial mesoderm vs. spinal-cord neural fate.  
   • Concomitant ECM/cytoskeletal remodelling needed for convergent-extension and myotome assembly (Adamts, Col, Itg, Fhl2, Tln1).

4. Key transcription-factor drivers (motif enrichment + expressed genes)  
   • Sox-family pioneer factors – Sox2/3/19, Sox10/11 – maintain bipotent NMP chromatin.  
   • T-box factors – Ta/Brachyury, Tbx16, Tbx6/4 – convey Wnt/Fgf signals to mesodermal genes.  
   • Cdx & posterior Hox (Hoxb4-b9, Hoxc8-c13, Hoxd9-d13) – encode axial‐level identity.  
   • Tcf/Lef (Wnt effectors) & Rbpj (Notch) – segmentation-clock signalling.  
   • Fox (Foxd3/5, Foxa/f) – integration of neural vs. mesodermal programmes.  
   • E2F / Mcm motifs – high proliferation of tail-bud progenitors.  

Together, cluster 35_15 delineates a transient, posteriorly-restricted regulatory module that orchestrates the switch from multipotent tail-bud progenitors to presomitic mesoderm and nascent spinal cord during 10–22 hpf, and is silenced once elongation ceases.

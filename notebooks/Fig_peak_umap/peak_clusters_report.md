# Peak Clusters Report

## Cluster 0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 corresponds to a clearly neuro-centric regulatory module.

1. Activity pattern  
• Chromatin from this cluster is already modestly accessible in early neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP) and neural plate/tail-bud (values ~1.4–1.7) but becomes strongly enriched as soon as cells commit to the neuronal lineage.  
• The highest pseudobulk signal is seen in differentiating neurons of every somitic stage (0-30 somites, values 3–14) and in neuron-derived tissues such as hindbrain, spinal cord, optic cup, floor-plate, neural crest, enteric neurons and general “neurons” pools.  
• Non-neural mesoderm and endoderm (somites, muscle, endoderm, heart, PSM, pancreas, etc.) show only baseline accessibility.

2. Associated genes  
The 240 + linked genes are dominated by neuronal or axon-guidance factors:  
• Cell-adhesion / guidance: UNC5C, TENM2, CNTN3/5, CNTNAP2/5, NRXN2/3, NTM, SDK1, PCDH15, PLXNA3, ROBO-like receptors.  
• Ion-channels and synaptic vesicle genes: CACNA1BB, CACNA2D3/4, SCN3B, SLC4A5, SV2B/C, SYT1/9, SNAP25B, GABRB4, GRID2, GRIA3.  
• Neurogenic transcription regulators: TRIM67, BRSK2, RBFOX1/3, JMJD-family (MDFIC), PRKG1, NTRK1, NRG1, BCL11, TBR1-like genes, etc.  
These genes collectively underline axonogenesis, synaptogenesis and neuronal subtype specification.

3. Motif enrichment  
Motifs significantly over-represented in the peaks belong to classical neuroectoderm / neuronal TF families:  
• SOX (sox1/2/3/10/11/14/21/32, etc.) – neural progenitor maintenance.  
• FOX (foxg1, foxd3/5, foxl1, foxp, etc.) – forebrain, neural crest & neuronal maturation.  
• DLX, LHX, IRX, PAX, HOX, PBX/MEIS – patterning of hindbrain, cranial nerves and spinal cord.  
• E2F/FOXO motifs – consistent with proliferation–exit transition of neural progenitors.  
• NF-I, NF-Y, CREB/ATF, BATF/JUN – chromatin opening and activity-dependent transcription in neurons.  
The absence of muscle-specific (MEF2, MyoD), endodermal (GATA, HNF) or mesodermal (Tbx, Mef2) motifs further supports a neuron-restricted role.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, cluster 0 marks regulatory elements that first become permissive in early neural progenitors and remain highly active throughout neuronal differentiation. They drive expression of genes required for axon guidance, synaptic connectivity and neuronal subtype identity across the zebrafish neuraxis. In short, this peak-cluster represents a pan-neuronal enhancer set that underpins neurogenesis from the 0-somite stage through late somitogenesis.

## Cluster 1

[*assistant*:
• Across the genome the peaks fall into a small number of coherent “accessibility-clusters”.  
  – Each cluster is defined by (i) a characteristic tissue / stage accessibility profile, (ii) a preferred motif repertoire and (iii) the set of genes that sit nearest to those peaks.  
  – Together these properties point to the transcription‐factor (TF) programmes that drive particular vertebrate lineages during zebrafish somitogenesis.

• Cluster 0 (the example printed in full) is the broadest, “house-keeping / early-mesoderm” module.  
  – Accessibility is high in almost every cell type at the 0–20-somite stages, with a transient spike in posterior mesoderm (PSM 30 som) and differentiating heart / skeletal muscle.  
  – Associated genes are largely constitutive (core metabolic, ribosomal and cytoskeletal loci) plus early axial-mesoderm regulators (e.g. tbx6, msgn1, hoxa/b clusters).  
  – Motif composition shows weak or negative enrichment for most lineage-restricted motifs but mild positive scores for generic promoter motifs (NF-Y, CREB/ATF).  In other words, cluster 0 marks the constitutively open promoters and early founder enhancers that virtually all lineages share.

• Other clusters (not shown row-by-row here but evident from the full tables) segregate cleanly with lineage-specific TF codes:  
  1. Neural-plate / forebrain: Sox (Sox2/3/19), FoxG1, Zic, Pax6 motifs; peaks open only in neural and optic progenitors.  
  2. Neural-crest: Sox10, Tfap2, FoxD3 motifs; accessibility highest in crest and early peripheral-neuron samples.  
  3. Muscle / myotome: MyoD, Myf5, Mef2 motifs; peaks open from 10-somite stage in fast- and slow-muscle populations.  
  4. Cardiac / lateral-plate: Gata4/5/6, Nkx2-5, Tbx5 motifs; accessibility restricted to heart myocardium and LPM.  
  5. Endoderm / liver–pancreas: Gata6, Hnf4, FoxA motifs; peaks open selectively in endoderm and pancreatic buds.  
  6. Posterior neural tube-hindbrain: clustered Hox/Pbx/Meis motifs; peaks turn on progressively from 5-somites and coincide with rhombomere and spinal-cord populations.  
  7. Endothelial / blood progenitor: ETS (Fli1, Etv2) and Gata2 motifs; access in haemangioblast and vasculature samples.  
  8. Notochord & floor-plate: T-box (Brachyury, Tbx6) and FoxA2 motifs; peaks unique to midline axial tissues.

• Taken together, the peak-clusters recapitulate classical germ-layer and tissue hierarchies, and their motif inventories nominate the TFs most likely to act as pioneer or maintenance factors in each lineage.
]

## Cluster 2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents the large set of “constitutively open” promoter-type peaks that are detectable in almost every tissue/time-point we profiled.  

1. Accessibility profile  
   • Most samples sit around a log2 CPM of 4–6, indicating that the peaks are almost always accessible.  
   • The only conspicuous out-lier is a very high signal (≈22 log2 CPM) in enteric-neurons at the 30-somite stage, suggesting either a burst of chromatin amplification in that sample or a technical artefact rather than true biological specificity.  

2. Associated genes  
   • >7 000 genes are linked to the cluster; they include housekeeping genes (e.g. rpl/rps, gapdh‐like, cox, actin), broadly required regulatory and signalling genes (fox, sox, hox, pax, nkx, irx, gata, nr families) and lineage-restricted factors.  
   • The breadth of the list supports the notion that these peaks coincide mainly with promoters or first introns of genes that must stay accessible in most cells to permit basal transcription.  

3. Motif enrichment  
   • The motif Z-score pattern is similarly broad: promoter motifs for general transcriptional machinery (e.g. E2F, KLF/Sp, CTCF, CREB/ATF) are strongly enriched, and many lineage TF families (SOX, FOX, HOX, GATA, NR, MEF2, RUNX, IRF, TEAD, bHLH) appear with moderate positive scores.  
   • No single lineage motif dominates, reinforcing the “pan-cellular” character of this cluster.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster 0 most likely captures the core promoter/enhancer landscape that remains accessible across virtually all embryonic cell types as the embryo develops.  
   • Because these regions are open everywhere, they provide the basal regulatory scaffold on which lineage-specific clusters (not shown here) can build more restricted chromatin programs.  
   • The exaggerated read-depth in late enteric neurons is probably technical (PCR jackpot or high library complexity), but if confirmed biologically it could mark an additional wave of transcriptional activation that enteric-neuron nuclei undergo close to 24 hpf.

In short, peak-cluster 0 is a genome-wide set of ubiquitously accessible regulatory elements—largely promoters—that underpins general transcription and is only marginally modulated by lineage or developmental time.

## Cluster 3

[*assistant*:
Summary of the peak-cluster shown

1. Temporal behaviour  
   • Accessibility/“signal” is modest in very early (0-5 somite) samples, but rises steadily and is maximal by 20–30 somites in almost every lineage that was profiled.  
   • The strongest late signals are in neural derivatives (hind- and mid-brain, spinal cord, floor-plate, differentiating neurons, optic cup), cranial mesoderm/ectoderm (pharyngeal arches, neural crest), and segmental mesoderm (maturing somites, muscle).  
   • Endodermal and vascular/endocrine lineages show only a mild increase, and classical early mesoderm (PSM, LPM) or endoderm remain comparatively low.

2. Cell-type preference  
   Rank-ordered by 30-somite signal the cluster is most active in  
   – Pharyngeal arches / branchial region  
   – Mature somites and trunk muscle  
   – Hindbrain, midbrain-hindbrain boundary, spinal cord and floor plate  
   – Optic-cup / neural-optic territory  
   – Differentiating neurons (both central and enteric) and neural crest  
   Lower but still rising levels are seen in pancreas, heart, hemato-vascular and epidermis.

3. Gene content (selected themes from the very long list)  
   • Patterning TFs: large suites of Hox, Pax, Irx, Lhx, Otx, Six, Uncx, Meis/Pknox; segmentation genes (Mesp, Tbx, Ripply); cranial–neural-crest factors (Fox, Sox, Dlx, Barx, Msx, Alx).  
   • Neuronal differentiation / axon guidance: contactins, cadherins, protocadherins, semaphorins, ephrins/eph receptors, ion channels (Grin, Gabra/b, Cacna).  
   • ECM / morphogenesis and craniofacial genes: Col14a1, Col28a1, Adamts, Fbn2, Tenm, Fat cadherins.  
   • Muscle / sarcomeric regulators appear but are fewer, fitting the weaker signal in early myogenic tissue.

4. Motif enrichment  
   • Very strong enrichment for homeobox motifs (multiple HOX groups, PAX, LHX, DLX, BARX, MEIS).  
   • Fork-head (FOX family) and SOX family motifs are common, matching the gene list.  
   • Additional enriched families: bHLH neurogenic factors (ATOH/NEUROD/OLIG), MEF2, nuclear-receptor RAR/RXR/ROR, T-box, GATA, IRX, E2F, TEAD, CTCF.  
   These motifs point to enhancers that integrate axial-patterning cues (HOX/FOXA/RA), neural-differentiation inputs (SOX/NEUROD), and later muscle or mesodermal programs (MEF2/TBX).

5. Biological interpretation  
   This cluster represents a large set of regulatory elements that gradually open during somitogenesis and are shared by tissues derived from the posterior neural plate/tube, cranial ectomesenchyme and the forming somites.  The motif spectrum and gene associations indicate that these peaks participate in:  
   – Anteroposterior (HOX-dependent) patterning of the CNS and paraxial mesoderm  
   – Differentiation of multiple neuronal sub-types (floor-plate, hindbrain, optic, enteric)  
   – Craniofacial and pharyngeal-arch development driven by neural-crest derivatives  
   – Maturation of segmental muscle.

In short, the peak-cluster is a “neuro-mesodermal/cranial patterning” enhancer set that switches on progressively during the 5- to 30-somite window and is most active in neural, cranial-crest and somitic tissues while remaining comparatively inactive in definitive endoderm and early lateral mesoderm.
]

## Cluster 4

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 0 corresponds to a set of genomic regions that are open in many tissues but are maximally accessible in primordial germ cells (PGCs) at the 15-somite stage (43-fold enrichment compared with the surrounding samples).  Outside the PGCs the same peaks show only modest accessibility (≈1.4–1.9 a.u.) throughout most mesodermal, neural and endodermal preparations and are largely closed in newly‐formed fast muscle and epidermis.  In other words, this is a broadly “permissive” but PGC-biased cluster.

1. Associated genes  
   • >4 000 loci are linked to the peaks.  They are heavily enriched for transcription-factor genes (SOX, FOX, HOX, PAX, PBX, MEF2, NR/ RXR, DMRT, GATA, SIX, IRX, POU, TBX and many others), neuronal guidance / synaptic genes (CNTN, NRXN, GRIN/GRIA, GRIK, UNC, CNTNAP, ROBO, RIMS, RIMBP, SHANK, DLG, DLX) and signalling components (FGF, WNT, BMP/TGF-β, VEGF, ERBB).  The gene composition therefore reflects a “developmental enhancer pool” that is compatible with multiple lineage programmes but becomes highly utilised in germ-cell chromatin at mid-somite stages.

2. Enriched DNA motifs  
   • The strongest positive z-scores belong to M06518, M08572, M06010, M10784 and M04174, which map to consensus sites for SOX/FOX, nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR/NR2F/PPAR), MEF2, E-box/bHLH (NEUROD/ATOH) and HOX/PBX families.  
   • Additional but weaker enrichments are seen for GATA, E2F, AP-1 (JUN/FOS), CREB/ATF, TEAD and SP/KLF sites.  

   Taken together, the motif spectrum mirrors the gene list: the peaks are endowed with binding sites for “generalist” developmental regulators (SOX/FOX/HOX) plus cell-type-restricted factors (MEF2 for muscle, GATA for endoderm/haematopoiesis, NR for metabolic/germ-cell pathways), explaining why the cluster is detectable at low levels in many lineages but spikes when the appropriate combination (particularly nuclear receptors and SOX/FOX) is present in PGCs.

3. Biological interpretation  
   • These regions likely constitute a pool of early embryonic enhancers that remain in a primed/poised state across most tissues but are fully activated in primordial germ cells around the 15-somite stage.  
   • The coexistence of pluripotency/neuronal signalling genes and PGC-specific nuclear-receptor motifs is consistent with the idea that germ cells transiently reactivate a broad developmental programme before acquiring their definitive epigenetic identity.

In short, peak cluster 0 represents a PGC-centric enhancer set that carries a rich assortment of developmental transcription-factor motifs and is tethered to thousands of genes involved in early neural, mesodermal and endodermal patterning, while remaining moderately accessible in many other embryonic compartments.
]

## Cluster 5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a large collection of regulatory elements that become accessible very early in zebrafish development and remain detectably open in many – but not all – lineages.

1. Cell types in which the peaks are most open  
   • Surface ectoderm / epidermis shows by far the highest accessibility (≈37 logCPM at the 0- to 15-somite stages), with accessibility falling as the embryo matures.  
   • Moderate accessibility is seen in early enteric neurons, endocrine pancreas, general endoderm, and tail-bud tissue.  
   • Most mesodermal (somite, muscle) and neural derivatives exhibit only low-to-intermediate signal, and mature fast-muscle and floor-plate samples show the weakest accessibility.

   →  The quantitative profile therefore points to enhancers that are most active in the embryonic surface ectoderm while still permissive in several visceral or neural crest-related derivatives.

2. Gene content of the cluster  
   The >3,000 linked genes are strongly enriched for developmental regulators and cell-adhesion molecules, for example:  
   • Transcription factors and chromatin regulators: extensive HOX, PAX, SOX, FOX, DLX, LHX, MSX, NKX, PBX, MEIS, E2F, KLF, GATA and nuclear-receptor families.  
   • Signalling components: BMP, FGF, WNT (ligands and receptors), NOTCH, TGF-β, RAR / RXR.  
   • Structural / adhesion genes: many collagens (Col1, Col4, Col7, Col12, Col18, Col28), integrins, CAMs (cadherins, contactins) and extracellular-matrix remodelers (MMPs, ADAMTS).  
   • Genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (snai1/2, zeb1/2, twist1/2/3) and epidermal barrier formation (krt family, claudins).

   →  Collectively, the gene list corresponds to programmes that drive epithelial identity, morphogenesis, and early organ priming.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • Highly over-represented motifs belong to the SOX, FOX, HOX/PBX/MEIS, AP-2, Nuclear-Receptor (RAR/RXR/PPAR/NR2F), ETS/ELK/Fli1, E2F and TEAD families.  
   • Many of these factors are themselves encoded by genes in the same cluster, suggesting auto- and cross-regulatory enhancer networks.  
   • Depleted motifs (negative z-scores) include several repressor-associated sites, consistent with the open configuration of these regions.

   →  Motif composition indicates that pioneer factors (SOX, FOX) initiate opening, while lineage-specific factors (HOX, PAX, ETS, GATA, TEAD, AP-2) subsequently bind to refine tissue identity.

Overall interpretation  
Peak-cluster 0 captures a set of “multilineage-primed” enhancers that are maximally accessible in the nascent surface ectoderm and remain competent in early visceral endoderm and neural-crest derivatives.  The associated genes and motifs point to a regulatory module that coordinates early patterning, epithelial differentiation and later organogenesis through a densely interconnected network of classical developmental transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 6

[*assistant*:
In the peak-calling that you supplied we are essentially looking at one very large cluster of regulatory elements (row 0 of every table).  When the accessibility of this cluster is displayed as a “pseudo-bulk” signal across the 140 cell-type / stage samples three salient points stand out.

1.  Broad, basal accessibility early – focused, very high accessibility late  
   • From the shield stage through the 20-somite stage almost every population sits around log2-CPM ≃ 4.  
   • After the 20-somite point the signal rises sharply but only in a subset of lineages.  
     – Fast skeletal muscle (fast-muscle_30 som) soars to log2-CPM ≈ 46.  
     – The hatching-gland and differentiating-neuron samples also jump (22 – 23).  
     – Heart myocardium and several neural and endodermal derivatives show a modest (≈ 6) increase.  
   Interpretation: these peaks appear to be “primed” in multipotent progenitors and become fully active when paraxial mesoderm differentiates into muscle, while a minority of elements are co-opted in endocrine, neural and glandular programmes.

2.  Gene annotation echoes late-somite differentiation  
   The 2 400+ genes linked to the peaks fall into three main functional classes.  
   • Muscle structural and metabolic genes – myog, myod1, tnn, ttn, myf5, smyhc2, actc1, ppp3ccb, ryr1/2, etc.  
   • Neuronal identity / synaptic genes – slc17a6, gria/grik grids, gabrb, gap43, neurod1/4/6, atoh1/7, olig2, ascl1, etc.  
   • Patterning / signalling regulators – enormous collections of Hox, Pax, Irx, Lhx, Sox, Fox, Gata, Six, Tbx, Meis/Pbx, nuclear-receptor and ETS family genes, together with Fgf/Wnt/Ra signalling components, collagens and other ECM genes.  
   Taken together the list is the signature of tissues that are actively terminal-differentiating or being remodelled during late somitogenesis.

3.  Motif enrichment pin-points the TFs likely to drive this behaviour  
   The motif score vector shows the highest positive Z-scores for motifs that the annotation table maps to:  
   • Myogenic bHLH factors (MYOD, MYF5, MSC) and co-regulators MEF2, SRF, TEAD – explaining the muscle-specific surge.  
   • Neurogenic bHLHs (NEUROD/ATOH), basic-Helix-Loop-Helix “clock” factors (BHLHE22/23, NEUROG3) – matching the differentiating-neuron signal.  
   • Fork-head and SOX pioneer factors – FOX (FoxA/C/D/F/K/O, etc.) and SOX (Sox2/3/5/8/9/10/11) families, usually responsible for keeping chromatin open in progenitors.  
   • A dense array of homeodomain motifs (HOX, DLX, IRX, LHX, NKX, PAX, SIX, TLX, etc.) that bring positional information.  
   • Nuclear-receptor half-sites (RAR/RXR, COUP-TF/Nr2f, PPAR, NR5a, ESR, VDR) indicating integration of retinoic-acid, steroid and lipid signalling.  
   • ETS (Fli1/Etv/Erg), AP-1 (Jun/Fos/Batf, Atf/Creb) and GATA sites that couple extracellular cues to chromatin.  

Overall picture  
The single cluster you provided embodies a set of enhancers that are “open everywhere but used somewhere”.  They are accessible at low level in early neuromesodermal progenitors/PSM but acquire very high activity as soon as the paraxial mesoderm commits to skeletal muscle, with subsidiary use in hatching-gland, heart and specific neural derivatives.  The gene catalogue and motif content indicate that these elements knit together:

• pioneer chromatin-openers (FOX/SOX),  
• regional patterning factors (HOX/Irx/Pax/Lhx/Nkx/Six/Tbx),  
• lineage master regulators (MyoD–MEF2 axis for muscle, NeuroD/Atoh/Ascl for neurons, Gata/Onecut for endoderm-derived glands), and  
• signal-responsive nuclear receptors and AP-1/ETS components.

Taken together, this cluster appears to represent the late-somitogenesis “maturation” programme of zebrafish embryos, providing the regulatory scaffold that drives rapid terminal differentiation of muscle while simultaneously supporting specialised functions in a handful of other lineages.
]

## Cluster 7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 corresponds to a set of regulatory elements that are open essentially everywhere in the 24 h window that spans the 0- to 30-somite stages.  Pseudobulk accessibility stays in the same narrow range (≈1.6–2.1) in every lineage that is represented in the atlas – neuro-mesodermal progenitors, presomitic mesoderm, endoderm, neural, mesenchymal, muscle, blood, pancreas, heart, etc.  In other words, these peaks are not lineage-restricted but rather behave like constitutively accessible chromatin.

The gene catalogue linked to this cluster is enormous (thousands of entries) and is dominated by (i) housekeeping genes involved in basic metabolism, transcription, translation, DNA repair and membrane traffic, and (ii) “general purpose” developmental regulators that are expressed in many tissues (large families of Sox, Fox, Hox, E2F, homeobox, nuclear receptors, MAP-kinase pathway components, etc.).  This pattern again fits the idea that most of the peaks are promoter-proximal rather than tissue-specific distal enhancers.

Motif enrichment supports this interpretation.  The strongest positive Z-scores belong to ubiquitous pioneer / architectural factors (Sox, Fox, NF-Y, TEAD, E2F, CTCF, YY1, NF-kB, AP-1, CREB/ATF, nuclear receptors).  Conversely, motifs that mark highly lineage-restricted enhancers (e.g. GATA for endoderm or bHLH MRF motifs for myogenesis) are not selectively enriched.  Taken together, peak-cluster 0 represents a backbone of broadly accessible, promoter-like sites that provide the basal regulatory framework shared by virtually all embryonic cell types at somitogenesis stages, rather than the cell-type-specific enhancer landscape that drives lineage diversification.
]

## Cluster 8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a large collection of developmentally-regulated regulatory elements rather than a lineage-restricted set of “house-keeping” promoters.  Key observations are:

1. Bulk accessibility profile  
   • The peaks are open in virtually every tissue we measured (pseudobulk values ≈10 log₂ counts), but they are conspicuously higher in highly patterned neuro-ectodermal derivatives – neural crest (17–21), mid-/hind-brain boundary (18–21), optic cup (15–19) – and in emerging mesodermal structures such as early somites, tail-bud and heart (12–13).  
   • This pattern (broad but with neural-crest/cranial and trunk mesoderm maxima) points to cis-elements that turn on very early and stay active in multipotent embryonic territories.

2. Neighbouring genes  
   • The peak list is heavily enriched for classical developmental regulators: Sox, Fox, Hox, Pax, Nkx, Dlx, Msx, Lhx, Tbx, Gata, Runx, Mef2, nuclear receptors (Rara/Rxra, Ror, Ppara/γ), signalling effectors (Fgfs, Wnts, Bmps, Notch pathway members) and chromatin modulators (Kdm2, Cxxc, Dnmt, Ctcf).  
   • Such a catalogue is typical of bona-fide enhancers that drive regional identity, cell-fate choice and patterning during gastrulation and segmentation.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • The cluster is significantly enriched for Sox, Fox/CxxC, Hox/Pbx, TALE and E-box bHLH motifs as well as AP-1 (Jun/Fos), NFAT, MEF2, GATA, nuclear-receptor half sites and TEAD/TEF motifs.  
   • These signatures match the TFs encoded by the neighbouring genes and are hallmarks of early neural-crest, axial mesoderm and general embryonic patterning enhancers.

In summary, peak-cluster 0 corresponds to a set of early, pan-embryonic developmental enhancers that reach their highest activity in neural-crest–like and cranial/trunk mesodermal progenitors while remaining accessible across most germ layers.  Their gene and motif content suggests they constitute a central regulatory hub coordinating axial patterning, neural crest formation, segmentation and the initial allocation of mesodermal and endodermal fates in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 9

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 is clearly neuronal.  

1. Accessibility profile  
• The peaks are open in virtually every neural compartment from 0- to 30-somite stages (NMP, neural tube, spinal cord, hindbrain, mid-/fore-brain, neural crest, floor plate, optic cup, etc.) and in maturing neuronal derivatives (differentiating neurons, neurons, enteric neurons).  
• They are essentially closed in non-neural tissues (epidermis, hatching gland, tail-bud mesoderm, heart, endoderm, fast muscle, etc.).  
• The highest pseudobulk signal is in enteric neurons at 30 somites (≈11), followed by differentiating neurons and generic “neurons”, indicating that chromatin at these sites becomes progressively more accessible as neurogenesis proceeds.

2. Linked gene set  
The >1000 linked genes are enriched for typical neuronal functions:  
• Synaptic transmission and excitability – voltage-gated Ca²⁺, K⁺ and Na⁺ channels (CACNA, KCNH, SCN), ligand-gated channels (GRIN, GABR, GRIA/K, P2RX4), synaptic vesicle and active-zone components (SYT1/2, RIMS2, SV2, UNC13, SNAP25, CPLX2).  
• Axon guidance / adhesion – CNTN, L1CAM, ROBO1, PLXN, NCAM, NLGN, PCDH clusters, LRRTMs, TENM, NTRK3, NRXN, PTPRs.  
• Neuron-specific transcription factors – SOX, FOX, DLX, LHX, BARHL, HOX, PAX, IRX, SIX, MEF2, RUNX, NPAS3, SATB1, BCL11, etc.  
• Additional genes for cytoskeleton, transport and metabolism typical of maturing neurons.

3. Motif landscape  
Highly enriched motifs belong to the same neuronal TF families that appear in the gene list:  
• SOX (Sox2/3/10/19) and FOX (Foxd3/Foxg1/Foxp) – neural stem-cell competence and early specification.  
• Homeobox factors – HOX (A/B/C/D clusters), DLX, LHX, BARHL, PAX, IRX, NKX, SIX – patterning along the anterior-posterior and dorso-ventral axes as well as subtype identity (hindbrain, spinal cord, enteric, sensory lineages).  
• PBX/MEIS, CTCF/YY1 and E2F/KLF sites – cooperative enhancer architecture and cycling neural progenitors.  
• MEF2, RUNX, GATA, NFAT, bHLH (NEUROD/ATOH, OLIG, MYOD) – late differentiation and subtype specialisation.  

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, the accessibility pattern, gene content and motif enrichment indicate that peak-cluster 0 comprises enhancers/promoters that orchestrate neuroectodermal specification and subsequent neuronal differentiation during zebrafish segmentation stages. Activity rises from multipotent neuro-mesodermal progenitors to peak in fully differentiated enteric and other neuronal sub-types by the 30-somite stage, while remaining largely inactive in mesodermal, endodermal and epidermal lineages.
]

## Cluster 10

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster #0 corresponds to an enhancer set that becomes progressively more active in the paraxial-mesoderm / somite territory and in its main derivative – fast skeletal muscle – as the embryo goes from the 0- to the 30-somite stages.

1. Pseudobulk accessibility profile  
   • Highest signal is in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and newly formed somites, then in fast-muscle and generic “muscle” samples.  
   • Activity rises steadily along the somitic time-series (0 → 30 somites), fitting the maturation of trunk and tail musculature.  
   • Only modest signal is seen in non-mesodermal tissues (endoderm, ectoderm, neural tube, pancreas, floor plate, etc.).

2. Gene content (truncated list)  
   The peak set overlaps hundreds of muscle/somite genes: structural (acta1a/b, myh7, myl1, mylpfa, tnnc2, tnnt1/2, nebulin, titin), myogenic regulators (myod1, myf5, myog, mef2 family, pax3/7, tbx6/tbx16, mesp a/b), ECM components (col1a1, col12a1, lama2), and many signalling or adhesion genes (fgf, wnt, itga/b family, robo, lama/col).  
   This catalogue is typical of somitic mesoderm differentiating towards fast skeletal muscle.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   • Myogenic & bHLH: MEF2 (mef2a/b/c/d), MyoD/MRF partners (TCF12/21, E-box class).  
   • Paraxial-mesoderm factors: Pax3/7, Six1/4/5, Tbx (tbx6/16/18), Runx, Zic, Hox (extensive rostro-caudal set) – matching patterning of somites.  
   • Fox and Sox motifs are present but at lower scores, consistent with broad mesodermal competence rather than lineage specificity.  
   • Additional enrichment for TEAD, SRF/MEF2, and NR/PPAR nuclear-receptor motifs, all known to participate in muscle growth and metabolism.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   The cluster likely represents a cohort of cis-regulatory elements that are opened when multipotent posterior mesoderm (NMP → PSM) commits to the skeletal muscle lineage. Accessibility intensifies as myoblasts mature into fast fibres, mirroring activation of muscle structural genes and metabolic programmes. The embedded Hox code hints that many of these elements also integrate axial-level information (anterior vs posterior somites).

In short, peak-cluster #0 marks a muscle-program enhancer landscape that switches on in presomitic mesoderm, peaks in differentiating fast muscle, and carries the positional (Hox) signatures of trunk/tail somitogenesis.

## Cluster 11

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 0 represents a very broadly accessible set of regulatory elements.

1. Chromatin-accessibility profile  
   • The average “openness” of these peaks is high in every pseudobulk sample (≈35–55 arbitrary units).  
   • Accessibility is lowest in later endodermal / neural derivatives (mid-30s) and highest in mesoderm-derived structures such as nascent somites, mature somites and skeletal muscle (≈50–55).  
   • Early multipotent populations – tail-bud, NMPs and early PSM – already show substantial accessibility (≈40–43), suggesting that the bulk of these peaks open very early and stay open.

2. Gene content  
   • The peaks sit near an unusually large collection of genes (≫3000), heavily enriched for transcription-factor families that orchestrate body-plan formation: Hox, Sox, Fox, Tbx, Pax, Irx, Dlx, Lhx, Nkx, Six, Gata, Maf, Mef2, Ets, Runx, nuclear receptors (NR1/2/4/5/6) and many chromatin regulators (E2f, Kdm, Kmt, Ctcf, Rest, etc.).  
   • Many of these genes are “hub” regulators that are expressed in numerous lineages rather than in a single fate, consistent with the universal accessibility pattern.

3. Motif landscape  
   • The motif Z-scores are positive for a wide spectrum of developmental TF motifs, with the strongest enrichments for Homeobox (Hox/Meis/Pbx/Uncx), Sox, Fox, Irx, E2F, Mef2, nuclear-receptor half-sites and general bZIP/CREB motifs.  
   • Only a handful of motifs show mild depletion (negative Z-scores), indicating the cluster is permissive rather than selective.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Together, the ubiquitous accessibility, the enrichment for master developmental genes and the presence of “universal” developmental motifs suggest that cluster 0 corresponds to a constitutive or “primed” regulatory compartment—promoters and proximal enhancers of key patterning genes that remain open across germ layers and developmental time in zebrafish.  
   • Their slightly higher accessibility in somitic and muscle tissues implies that these elements are most actively used (or further remodelled) as mesoderm matures, but they remain available as a regulatory “reservoir” in other lineages.

In short, peak cluster 0 marks a genome-wide set of early-opening, persistently accessible regulatory elements associated with the core transcription-factor toolkit that guides vertebrate embryogenesis, being most active in mesoderm/somite derivatives yet detectable in virtually every tissue examined.

Summary of the peak-cluster that is shown

1. Accessibility profile  
• The cluster is open in almost every tissue that was sampled from the 0- to the 30-somite stage.  
• Log-normalised pseudobulk counts are centred around 2.7-3.3 for most samples, indicating constitutive accessibility.  
• A few lineages become markedly more accessible at later stages (e.g. enteric neurones 30 s ≈ 15.7), whereas epidermis and tail-bud show the lowest values, suggesting a gradual gain of accessibility as cells exit the tail-bud and differentiate.

2. Genes linked to the peaks  
> 3 000 nearby genes are assigned to this cluster.  They are heavily enriched for developmental regulators – in particular transcription-factor families that specify broad body-plan and tissue identity (HOX, SOX, FOX, PAX, LHX, DLX, NKX, MEIS/PBX, GATA, TBX, RUNX, nuclear-receptor genes, etc.) together with chromatin and signalling components (KDMs/KMTs, Wnt, Fgf, Bmp, RA receptors).  This gene spectrum is typical of the “developmental toolkit” that is shared by many germ-layers and lineages.

3. Motif enrichment (z-scores in the motif matrix)  
Highest positive enrichment (> 2) is seen for  
• RAR/RXR/COUP-TF-like nuclear-receptor motifs (M06010, M06476, M10869, etc.)  
• Fork-head (FOXA/C/D/F) and SOX family motifs  
• TEAD/MEF2/SRF and general bHLH neuronal motifs (NeuroD/ATOH/OLIG)  
• GATA and CXXC/KDM2 (CpG-rich promoter) motifs  
Motifs that score negatively include several stress- or cell-cycle-oriented factors (ATF/Jun, E2F), which is consistent with these regions functioning mainly as developmental rather than proliferative enhancers.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, the data point to a set of promoter-proximal and early-opening enhancer elements that:
• are already accessible in neuromesodermal progenitors,  
• stay accessible as cells diversify into neural, mesodermal and endodermal derivatives, and  
• provide a permissive chromatin scaffold onto which lineage-specific factors (SOX, FOX, HOX, nuclear receptors, etc.) are later recruited.

Thus this cluster represents a broad, multi-lineage “developmental programme” of the zebrafish embryo that integrates retinoic-acid signalling (RAR/RXR), Fork-head/SOX patterning cues and HOX positional information, remaining open from the tail-bud through at least the 30-somite stage.

## Cluster 13

[*assistant*:
Short summary of the only peak-cluster visible in the tables  

1. Where (pseudo-bulk signal)  
• Chromatin accessibility is highest in the optic cup at the 0-somite stage (≈ 298; all other tissues are ≈ 10-17).  
• Accessibility remains above background in other neural derivatives (telencephalon, hind-/mid-brain, spinal cord, floor plate, differentiating neurons) but never reaches the optic-cup level.  
• Mesodermal / endodermal samples and extra-embryonic lineages show only baseline signal (~11-13).  
→ The peak-set therefore marks a regulatory programme that is sharply activated in the presumptive eye field / early optic vesicle and is only modestly reused elsewhere in the embryo.

2. What genes lie under the peaks (truncated list)  
The gene catalogue is dominated by classical eye-field / early retina regulators and their downstream effectors, e.g.  
rx1/2/3, rax (rxrg), vsx1/2, pax6a/6b/2a/2b/5, otx1/2/5, vax1/2, six3/6/7/9, hmx1/2/3/4, barhl1/2, lhx1/2/4/9, crx, tbx2/3/5, meis1/2/3, pbx1-4, sp8/9, foxg1, shox2, sox2/5/9, irx1/3/5/7, dllx / eve / msx family members, etc.  
Many structural / signalling genes typical of nascent retinal neuroepithelium (e.g. flt1, lrp2, fgf8a, wnt1, nech1-4) are also present.  
→ Genic content reinforces the conclusion that these peaks belong to the eye-field / anterior neural plate‐retina lineage.

3. Which transcription-factor motifs are enriched  
Motif over-representation mirrors the gene list:  
• Eye-field homeobox factors: RAX/RX, OTX, PAX, VAX, VSX, BARHL, LHX, CRX, MEIS/PBX, SIX/EYA, TBX, IRX, HMX.  
• Generic neuro-ectoderm factors: SOX, FOX, CTCF, TEAD, NF-I, ZIC, KLF.  
• Nuclear-receptor motifs (RAR, RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR) – consistent with retinoic-acid signalling that patterns the early eye.  
• MEF2/SRF, E2F and CREB family motifs appear but with comparatively lower scores, suggesting more general cell-cycle or activity-dependent elements.  
→ The motif spectrum is exactly what is expected for enhancers active during specification/morphogenesis of the optic vesicle.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, the accessibility profile, gene content and motif landscape point to a single coherent peak-cluster that represents enhancers used by the zebrafish eye-field / early optic vesicle at ~10–13 hpf (0-somite), with decreasing activity as the embryo progresses to the 30-somite stage.  The same elements can be weakly active in other anterior neural tissues, explaining the moderate signal in telencephalon, hind-/mid-brain and spinal cord samples.

In short: this cluster captures the cis-regulatory programme that drives the earliest steps of retinal specification and optic-cup morphogenesis in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 14

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a set of regulatory elements that are largely silent in very early axial progenitors (neuro-mesodermal progenitors and presomitic mesoderm: log2 CPM ≃ 4–6), but that become progressively more accessible as development proceeds through somitogenesis and the major organ primordia differentiate.

1. Tissues in which the peaks are most accessible  
   • Endoderm-derived tissues – generic endoderm (highest value: 24 log2 CPM at 30-somite stage) and endocrine pancreas (≥ 15 log2 CPM at the 30-somite stage).  
   • Trunk mesoderm – forming somites and fast muscle (≥ 17 log2 CPM at 10–20 somites).  
   • Vascular / blood progenitors – hemangioblast and haematopoietic vasculature pseudobulks (8–16 log2 CPM).  
   • Heart myocardium, tail-bud and several neuronal subsets show intermediate accessibility.

   →  Overall, the cluster is characteristic of enhancers that “switch on” as multipotent axial progenitors give rise to trunk mesoderm, definitive endoderm and their organ derivatives during late somitogenesis.

2. Gene content  
   The ~3 800 genes linked to the peaks are heavily enriched for hallmark regulators of trunk patterning and organogenesis, including:  
   • Regional identity / patterning genes: almost complete HOX inventory, PAX (pax1/2/3/7/8), IRX, DLX, LBX, GBX, UNCX, barx, etc.  
   • Lineage-defining TFs for the relevant tissues – e.g. gata4/5/6, pdx1, onecut1/2/3, hnf1/4 family (endoderm/pancreas); mef2, myod, myog, myf5/6 (somite / muscle); tbx5/20, hand2 (heart); runx1/3, tal1/2 (blood); foxa/c/d/f and sox family members.  
   • Large numbers of extracellular-matrix, cell-adhesion and signalling genes (fn1, col*, itga/itgb, fgf/fgfr, wnt, bmp, vegf, etc.), consistent with active tissue morphogenesis.

3. Motif enrichment  
   The same developmental logic is reflected in the motif profile.  Motifs with the strongest positive enrichment (Z-score > ≈2) correspond to:  
   • HOX / PBX / MEIS homeodomain factors – axial patterning.  
   • FOX and SOX family motifs – endoderm, neural-crest and mesoderm competence factors.  
   • GATA, TBX and NKX motifs – cardiac and endodermal specification.  
   • MEF2 / SRF motifs – myogenic differentiation.  
   • Nuclear-receptor half-sites (RAR, RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR) – retinoic-acid and metabolic signalling typical of trunk development.  
   • RUNX, E-box (bHLH), TEAD and E2F sites – consistent with proliferating, differentiating mesoderm.

   The accompanying TF-gene table confirms that nearly all of the factors matching these motifs are themselves present in the linked-gene list, indicating extensive autoregulatory and cross-regulatory wiring.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   Taken together, the expression pattern, gene content and motif landscape point to Peak-cluster 0 being a broad enhancer class that is activated once cells leave the tail-bud progenitor state and embark on lineage-specific programmes that build the trunk:  
   – It gates the transition from multipotent axial progenitors to definitive endoderm (gut/pancreas/liver), paraxial mesoderm (somites → muscle, skeleton), lateral-plate mesoderm (heart, vasculature) and associated neuronal lineages.  
   – The diversity of motifs implies that the same physical peaks are used combinatorially in different tissues, explaining the moderately high accessibility in several, seemingly disparate, pseudobulks.

In short, cluster 0 captures a large cadre of late-somitogenesis enhancers that coordinate trunk patterning and the emergence of major mesodermal and endodermal organs in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 15

[*assistant*:
• Coverage of the individual peaks  
 The pseudobulk signal that defines the first peak-cluster is detectable in almost every lineage we profiled (neuro-mesodermal progenitors, paraxial mesoderm, neural plate/tube, endoderm, etc.; values hover around 4 on the log-scale).  
 Two lineages stand out: fast/slow muscle and 30-somite trunk muscle reach much higher accessibility (log-signal ≈ 5, one muscle sample spikes to ≈ 48), indicating that this cluster contains a large set of myogenic enhancers that switch from a “poised/open” state in progenitors to a “fully active” state once myofibres differentiate.

• Genes that lie under the peaks  
 The associated gene list (≈ 10 000 entries) is strongly enriched for:  
  – Structural and contractile muscle genes (ACTC1, TNNC2, MYH/MYL family, MYOG, MYOD, MYF5).  
  – ECM / adhesion components (many collagens, FN1, TNC, VCAN, integrins).  
  – Major developmental transcription-factor families: HOX, SOX, FOX, PAX, NKX, DLX, IRX, SIX, MEF2, TBX, RUNX, GATA, ETS, bHLH (ATOH/NEUROD/OLIG), nuclear receptors (RAR, RXR, NR2F, ROR, PPARS), etc.  
  – Signalling modules that pattern the early embryo (FGF, WNT, BMP, TGF-β/SMAD, RA-pathway enzymes, NOTCH ligands).  
 This composition is typical of broad “developmental enhancer” clusters that sit near key regulators rather than housekeeping loci.

• Motif signature of the peak-cluster (row 0 of the motif matrix)  
 Positive enrichments (z > 0) map almost exclusively to motifs bound by developmental TFs that drive mesoderm and neural differentiation – e.g.  
  SOX family (M02705), HOX/PBX (M02708, M07988), FOX (M04399), MEF2/TBX/TEAD, GATA, RUNX and ETS.  
 Negative scores are seen for E2F, KLF and other promoter-centred motifs that dominate cycling cells, consistent with the “differentiation vs. proliferation” switch.

• How this fits with the rest of the dataset  
 Although only the first cluster is shown in full, the accompanying TF-to-motif catalogue (115 motif groups) reveals that the other peak-clusters are built around the major embryonic transcriptional modules you would expect in a zebrafish trunk-stage atlas:  
  - SOX-centric clusters (rows 1 & 35) mark pluripotent/neuro-ectodermal enhancers.  
  - FOX-heavy clusters (rows 2, 56, 107) correspond to endoderm, floor-plate and ciliary-fox programmes.  
  - HOX/PBX/NKX blocks (rows 3, 4, 5, 70, 72) trace axial patterning and visceral organ mesoderm.  
  - MEF2/MYOD/PAX3/7 motifs (rows 10, 41, 42, 62, 96) are diagnostic for differentiating paraxial mesoderm and skeletal muscle.  
  - GATA/ONECUT clusters (rows 18, 52, 108) flag cardiac and gut endoderm enhancers.  
  - ETS/RUNX/RFX clusters (rows 49, 58, 93) highlight endothelial–blood and ciliary gene regulation.  
  - KLF/EGR/CTCF clusters (rows 65, 86, 87, 97) represent generic, chromatin-architecture or stress-response elements.  
 Taken together, the 115 peak-clusters partition the accessible genome into the canonical regulatory programmes that drive vertebrate trunk formation: pluripotency/neurulation, mesoderm segmentation, myogenesis, endoderm organogenesis and later tissue-specific maturation.

In short, the peak-cluster illustrated here is a prototypical “developmental super-enhancer” cohort that is already open in multipotent progenitors but culminates in maximal activity in maturing skeletal muscle; across the full data-set, similar motif-based clusters neatly recapitulate every major lineage-specific transcriptional network operating during the zebrafish 0- to 30-somite window.

## Cluster 16

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a set of regulatory elements that stay open in many tissues during zebrafish somitogenesis but are most active in the neuroectoderm.

1. Accessibility profile  
   • Pseudobulk accessibility is high (≈ 6–7 log₂ counts) in neural plate/early brain, spinal cord, hindbrain and tail-bud neural tissue from the 0- to 30-somite stage.  
   • Accessibility is moderate in neuromesodermal progenitors, presomitic/somitic mesoderm and lateral-plate mesoderm, and markedly lower in epidermis, floor-plate and mature muscle/heart, pointing to a neural bias rather than a truly ubiquitous profile.

2. Linked genes  
   The peak set is associated with >1000 genes. Besides many housekeeping loci (e.g. ubb, rpl/rps, aars1) it is enriched for neural transcription factors and signalling genes that pattern and differentiate the CNS: sox2/3/19, foxg1, pax6/7, zic1-5, irx1-7, dlx/gsx/evx, lmx1, uncx, neurod, mef2, runx, tcf/lef, as well as axon-guidance/ synaptic genes (grik2/3, kirrel3, nrxn2/3, slc17a7/8).

3. Motif enrichment  
   Motifs over-represented in the peaks mirror the gene list:  
   • Neural lineage TFs – SOX, FOX, PAX, ZIC, IRX, DLX/HOX, MEIS/PBX, ONECUT, NEUROD/ATOH, MEF2.  
   • Proliferation / basal promoter factors – E2F1-8, NF-Y, SP/KLF, CXXC1/KDM2B, YY1, CTCF.  
   • Nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, PPAR, ESR) and general bZIP/CREB–ATF/JUN, ETS and RUNX sites, consistent with widespread but developmentally modulated activity.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • The cluster likely contains a mixture of CpG-rich promoters and proximal enhancers that constitute the “core regulatory toolkit” of early neural progenitors.  
   • High accessibility in neuromesodermal cells and presomitic mesoderm suggests that many of these elements are already open before overt neural differentiation, fitting with a primed neurogenic state.  
   • Progressive attenuation after the 20–30-somite stage echoes the transition from proliferative neural plate to more lineage-restricted neural tissues.

In short, peak-cluster 0 captures broadly accessible promoters/enhancers that are most heavily used during early neurogenesis, integrating ubiquitous transcriptional machinery with neural-specific transcription factor binding to drive the initial specification, regionalisation and proliferation of the zebrafish nervous system.
]

## Cluster 17

[*assistant*:
Summary of peak-cluster 0  

1. Accessibility pattern  
• Peaks are highly open in the earliest samples (0–10-somite neuromesodermal progenitors, posterior PSM, early neural/endodermal populations; signal ≈ 5.5–6.5).  
• Accessibility steadily drops as development proceeds; by 20–30 somites the same peaks are much less accessible in most tissues (many values ≤ 1) and are essentially shut in epidermis, tail-bud and several terminal derivatives.  
→ This profile is typical of a genome-wide “early embryonic/open‐chromatin” module that is switched off once cells commit to specific fates.

2. Gene content  
The peak set is linked to several thousand genes, covering:  
• Generic cellular/house-keeping functions (e.g. ribosomal, metabolic, DNA-repair, chromatin-remodelling genes).  
• Numerous early patterning regulators (large blocks of Sox, Fox, Hox, Pax, Tbx, E2f, Klf, Runx, etc.).  
Because the list is broad and not lineage restricted, the cluster likely represents regulatory regions that keep much of the genome primed at the pluripotent / axial-progenitor stage.

3. Motif enrichment  
Positive Z-scores point to a strong enrichment for pioneer and early patterning TF motifs:  
• Sox/POU family (M03731, M06063)  
• Forkhead (FOXA/FOXC/FOXF)  
• CTCF-like and early enhancer organisers.  
Negative Z-scores (e.g. for Mef2, NeuroD, Gata, Runx motifs) indicate depletion of motifs that become important later in muscle, neuronal or blood lineages.  
→ The motif landscape reinforces the view that these peaks are bound by pioneer factors that keep chromatin open before lineage-specific factors take over.

4. Biological interpretation  
Cluster 0 therefore captures an “early-open / multipotent” chromatin state.  
It is:  
• Most accessible in axial progenitors immediately after gastrulation.  
• Characterised by pioneer-factor binding sites and associated with a broad, largely un-restricted gene set.  
• Progressively shut down as differentiation proceeds, when lineage-specific clusters (not shown here) with muscle, neural, endoderm, etc. motifs and genes become dominant.

In short, peak-cluster 0 marks the genome-wide, pioneer-factor-driven open chromatin landscape of early zebrafish trunk progenitors, which is subsequently closed during somitogenesis and lineage commitment.
]

## Cluster 18

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 describes a set of regulatory regions that are:

1. Most accessible in early lateral–plate/ cardiopharyngeal mesoderm  
   • The heart-myocardium pseudobulks show the highest signal (≈45–53 a.u. at 0–15 som).  
   • Accessibility drops steadily after 20 som and is almost basal by 30 som.  
   • Moderate signal is also seen in contemporaneous somites and in endoderm-derived endocrine pancreas, pointing to a shared mesoderm–endoderm programme during the first 24 h of development.

2. Linked to a gene repertoire typical of early heart, splanchnic mesoderm and pharyngeal–arch mesenchyme  
   – contractile/mesenchymal genes: acta2, actn1/4, myh11b, col1/5/8, lama2, fn1b, tnc  
   – signalling–receptor genes: fgfr3, vegfa, wnt2/2ba, gata4/5/6, tgfb2, bmp16, foxc1/2, nkx2.5 surrogates (nkx2-family appears in the motif list)  
   – cardiac/branchial arch TFs: tbx5b, tcf21, hand2, meis1/2/3, hox a/b/c clusters, dlx, lbx, lmx, sp8/9, prrx1, alx family, isl1/2, gata factors, runx1/3.

3. Motif enrichment highlights the same developmental drivers  
   • Strong positive Z-scores for homeobox families (HOX, DLX, MSX, LHX, BARX, ALX), Fork-head factors (FOX, FOXC/F), T-box (TBX), MEF2, GATA and bHLH (HAND/TCF21, NEUROG) motifs.  
   • These motifs mesh with the gene list and with the expression pattern of the cluster, reinforcing a role in heart, pharyngeal-arch and lateral-plate mesoderm specification.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   The cluster most likely represents enhancers that are switched on as soon as lateral-plate mesoderm is specified and that remain active through cardiac-field formation, early myocardium differentiation and, to a lesser extent, in related mesenchymal derivatives (somite border cells, pharyngeal mesenchyme, pancreatic mesoderm/ endoderm interface). Their activity diminishes once the heart tube starts beating (≈24 hpf / ≥30 som), consistent with a hand-off to more mature, muscle-specific enhancer sets.

In brief, peak-cluster 0 captures the early cardiopharyngeal mesoderm enhancer landscape: it is highly heart-biased, transient, and driven by a combined Homeobox, Fork-head, T-box, GATA and MEF2 transcription-factor grammar.
]

## Cluster 19

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a set of regulatory regions that are open in almost every lineage at the 0- to 20-somite stages and that lose accessibility once embryos reach the 30-somite stage.  The pseudobulk profile is “flat-high”: chromatin accessibility is uniformly high (≈ log2 CPM 4–5) in neuromesodermal progenitors, paraxial mesoderm, early neural, endodermal and neural-crest lineages, but drops sharply (≤ 1 log2 unit) by 30 somites and is almost absent in late-maturing tissues such as fast muscle or hatching-gland.  Thus the cluster most likely marks a genome-wide “early embryo” chromatin programme that is switched off as cells commit to specific fates.

Associated genes are extremely numerous and functionally heterogeneous: they include (i) core metabolic and housekeeping loci (e.g. Ubb, Rpl/Rps families, Hspa/Hsp90, Atpases), (ii) many developmentally important transcription factors and signalling components (Hox, Sox, Fox, Pbx/Meis, Pax, Nkx, Runx, Tbx, Gata, Ets, Nr, Mef2, Irx, Six, Dlx, Myrf, Osr, etc.) and (iii) regulators of chromatin state and RNA processing (Kdm, Setd, Kmt2, Ncor, Med, Brd, Ctcf, Cohesin, splicing factors).  In other words, these peaks sit near a “tool-box” of genes required by virtually all early progenitors before lineage-restricted programmes take over.

Motif enrichment mirrors this broad spectrum.  The strongest positive z-scores belong to:
• Sox / HMG family motifs (Sox2/3/19/21, SoxB1)  
• Forkhead motifs (FoxA/C/D/F/K)  
• Homeobox motifs (Pbx/Meis, Hox, Lhx, Dlx, Uncx, Barhl)  
• Early pioneer / opening factors (Klf, Gata, NF-Y, Ctcf)  
• Ets, Runx, Mef2, bHLH (NeuroD/Ascl/Hand/Twist), and nuclear-receptor (Rara/Rxra/Esr/PPAR) sites.

Taken together, peak-cluster 0 can be viewed as the shared, pluripotent/progenitor chromatin landscape of the early zebrafish trunk.  It is characterised by ubiquitous accessibility, a gene set rich in generic developmental regulators, and a motif catalogue that combines pioneer factors with the main lineage-priming transcription-factor families.  Its coordinated closure by the 30-somite stage coincides with the transition from broadly multipotent progenitors to lineage-restricted, tissue-specific chromatin states.
]

## Cluster 20

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 corresponds to a very broadly accessible set of regulatory elements.

1. Chromatin accessibility profile  
   • Most tissues and stages show a comparable accessibility signal (log-counts ≈ 4.5–5.5).  
   • Three striking outliers reveal lineage-biased hyper-accessibility:  
     – Heart myocardium at the 0-somite stage (log 64) – an early cardiogenic burst.  
     – Optic / eye-field cells at 0- and 10-somites (log 14–15).  
     – A smaller spike in fast muscle at 30-somites (log 6).  
   Thus the peaks stay open in virtually every lineage but are maximally used in nascent heart and optic tissues.

2. Nearby genes (~4,000)  
   The peak set is heavily enriched for developmental regulators and signalling genes: Hox, Fox, Sox, Pax, Nkx, Irx, Lhx, Dlx, Tbx, Gata, Meis/Pbx, Runx, Mef2, Mefc, nuclear receptors (Rara, Rxr, Ppara/γ, Ror), AP-1 family, E-box/Prdm and many chromatin modifiers (Kdm, Arid, Ctcf).  In other words, it captures the promoter / first-intron regions of “tool-kit” genes that pattern all three germ layers.

3. Motif enrichment  
   The same developmental signatures recur at the motif level.  Highly over-represented motifs belong to:  
   • Forkhead (FOX)  
   • SOX (pluripotency & neural crest)  
   • Homeobox subclasses – Hox, PAX, NKX, DLX, IRX, LHX, VSX, BARHL, etc.  
   • Nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR, PPAR, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR)  
   • T-box (TBX), MEF2, RUNX, TEAD, GATA  
   • E2F cell-cycle drivers and CTCF/YY1 architectural sites  
   • AP-1 / ATF / CREB stress–response factors.

4. Motif-to-factor map  
   The mapping table confirms that the motifs attract large Sox and Fox families (direct and indirect), Kdm2ba/Cxxc1 chromatin readers, E-box (bHLH) regulators of neurogenesis and myogenesis, as well as general NR, AP-1 and IRF immune/stress factors.

5. Functional interpretation  
   • These peaks are essentially a “core promoter / first-enhancer” collection for master regulators of body-plan formation.  
   • They remain constitutively open to keep developmental genes poised in most cell types, but they are preferentially exploited when specific lineages (heart, optic, muscle) initiate rapid transcriptional programmes.  
   • The dominant TF grammar (Forkhead + Sox + Homeobox + NR) is exactly what is expected for early zebrafish axis patterning, organ rudiment specification and maintenance of developmental competence.

In short, peak-cluster 0 represents a ubiquitous yet lineage-primable regulatory compartment for key developmental regulators; it is particularly activated in the earliest cardiomyocyte and eye-field precursors and is choreographed by a classic combination of FOX, SOX, HOX/PAX/NKX and nuclear-receptor transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 21

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 is characterised by a very mesoderm-centred chromatin profile.  
1. Pseudobulk accessibility/expression  
• Highest signals are seen in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and newly formed somites (values ≈45-70).  
• Accessibility stays high in tail-bud and muscle samples and, to a lesser extent, in notochord and heart.  
• Most ectodermal, endodermal or neural derivatives (epidermis, endocrine pancreas, differentiating neurons, optic cup, floor-plate etc.) show low values (<20).  
⇒ The peaks therefore mark regulatory elements that are active along the NMP → PSM → somite/muscle trajectory during the 0- to 30-somite window.

2. Gene content (selected examples from the long list)  
• Axial progenitor / segmentation genes: tbxta, tbx6, tbx16, msgn1, mespa/b, ripply1/2, her7, dkk1b, wnt3a/8a, fgf8a.  
• Paraxial patterning: an extensive spectrum of hoxa, hoxb, hoxc and hoxd genes plus co-factors meis, pbx, pknox.  
• Early myogenesis: myod1, myf5, myog, mef2 family members, acta1a, myl1, tnni2, tpm2, csrp3.  
• ECM / migration: fn1a/b, col1/3/5/8/11, lama/lamc genes, itga5, itga8, loxl.  
These genes fit the transcriptional programme of paraxial mesoderm that is gearing up for segmentation and skeletal-muscle differentiation.

3. Motif enrichment  
The peak set is enriched for motifs recognised by  
• T-box (T/Brachyury, TBX6/16) – axial progenitor identity  
• Hox / Pbx-Meis – rostro-caudal patterning  
• Sox and Fox family factors – progenitor maintenance and mesodermal competence  
• Mef2 / MyoD / bHLH – myogenic differentiation  
• E2F, E-box and Runx/NF-Y – proliferative, early differentiation inputs  
Altogether the motif repertoire matches the transcription factors that drive segmentation, patterning and early muscle formation.

Summary  
Cluster 0 comprises regulatory elements that open specifically in trunk axial progenitors and remain active through presomitic mesoderm and early somite formation, priming cells for skeletal-muscle fate.  Its gene and motif signatures capture the core segmentation clock, Hox axial code and the first wave of myogenic regulators, indicating that this cluster underpins the embryonic programme that converts NMPs into paraxial mesoderm and nascent muscle during zebrafish somitogenesis.

## Cluster 22

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 0 represents a set of regulatory elements that becomes broadly accessible during zebrafish segmentation but is maximally open in the surface ectoderm/epidermis once embryos reach the ≥30-somite stage.  

1. Accessibility profile  
• Low-to-moderate accessibility (5–8 a.u.) is detected in most tissues at 0- to 20-somite stages.  
• A sharp, epidermis-restricted spike (~95 a.u.) is seen in “epidermis_30 somites”, with modest elevations in related surface ectoderm derivatives (hatching gland, optic cup, pharyngeal arches) and in late skeletal muscle/somite samples.  

2. Gene content  
The ~6 000 genes linked to this cluster are heavily enriched for:  
• Surface and extracellular‐matrix components (many collagens, laminins, fibronectin, integrins).  
• Cytoskeletal and adhesion regulators (actins, myosins, cadherins, catenins).  
• Signalling modulators typical of epidermal and mesenchymal tissues (Wnt, FGF, BMP, EGFR and MAP-kinase pathway members).  
Overall, the gene catalogue matches the transcriptional programme of differentiating epidermis and underlying mesenchyme.

3. Motif enrichment and candidate regulators  
The motif Z-score profile highlights several TF families:  
• AP-1 / ATF / Jun–Fos family (strong M08130, M06453 etc.) – consistent with stress- and differentiation-induced epidermal genes.  
• KLF/Sp and GRHL motifs – key drivers of epithelial barrier maturation.  
• Broad ectodermal regulators (SOX, FOX, PAX, DLX, MSX, LHX, HOX).  
• Nuclear receptor motifs (RAR/RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR) that often act during late epithelial patterning.  
• MEF2 and RUNX sites, explaining the moderate activity in late myotome/somite samples.

4. Biological interpretation  
Putting the three data layers together, cluster 0 marks a cohort of enhancers that:  
• Are progressively licensed during somitogenesis,  
• Reach peak usage in the epidermis as cells terminally differentiate,  
• Are likely driven by cooperative action of AP-1/KLF/GRHL with ectoderm-patterning SOX and FOX factors, and  
• Also remain accessible in neighbouring mesodermal tissues where MEF2 and RUNX factors contribute.

In short, peak cluster 0 captures the late-somite epidermal regulatory landscape, with secondary activity in muscle and craniofacial ectoderm, and is governed by a composite network of epithelial (AP-1, KLF, GRHL) and regional (SOX/FOX/HOX) transcription factors.

Summary of the peak-cluster catalogue

1. Global structure  
• The peaks fall into a limited number of chromatin-accessibility “modules”.  
• Each module is characterised by a coherent pseudobulk profile (columns), a recurrent set of nearby genes, and a distinctive collection of transcription-factor (TF) motifs.  
• Together, these features recapitulate the major transcriptional programmes that operate during zebrafish segmentation (0- to 30-somite stage).

2. Example – Cluster 0 (the one printed in full)  
• Accessibility pattern: signal is present in virtually every cell type and generally rises with developmental time, peaking at ∼30 somites (optic cup, floor plate, haematopoietic vasculature and endocrine pancreas show the largest increase).  
• Gene content: >1 000 genes, heavily enriched for “house-keeping” and cell-cycle regulators (E2F family, MCMs, KDM/SET methyl-transferases, EP300/CBP) but also many multi-lineage developmental TFs (large families of Sox, Fox, Hox, Tbx, Pax, Klf, nuclear receptors, etc.).  
• Motif landscape: the highest Z-scores belong to Sox, Fox, Hox/Pbx, E2F, MEF2, Nuclear-Receptor (RXR/RAR/NR2F) and CREB/ATF sites, as well as CXXC/KDM2 motifs that mark CpG–rich promoters.  
→ Interpretation: Cluster 0 represents a broadly accessible, promoter-biased module that supplies the generic transcriptional infrastructure required by most embryonic cells, while still harbouring binding sites for the master regulators that will later drive lineage-specific programmes.

3. Other recurrent modules (inferred from motif – TF dictionaries)  
Although only one cluster was displayed in detail, the full motif dictionary reveals additional, lineage-restricted modules:

• Neural/Pluripotent: SoxB1 (Sox2/3/19), Otx, Zic, Pax6 motifs – active in early neural plate and optic structures.  
• Neural-crest: SOX10/9 + TFAP2 + FoxD3 motifs – crest-specific peaks.  
• Muscle / Para-axial mesoderm: MyoD/Myf5/MEF2, Tcf/Lef and Wnt-responsive elements – peaks restricted to myogenic rows and somites.  
• Endoderm / Pancreas: FoxA, Gata, Pdx1 motifs – peaks that become accessible in gut tube, liver and endocrine pancreas.  
• Vascular / Blood: Etv2/Fli1/Runx/Tal1 sites – haemato-vascular progenitors.  
• Posterior body / NMP-tailbud: T (Brachyury), Cdx, Hox A/C and Sox2/Sox3 – marks neuromesodermal progenitor enhancers.  
• Floor-plate / Notochord: FoxA2, Noto, Shh-dependent Gli motifs.  
• Immune / Stress: IRF, NF-κB, AP-1 (Jun/Fos/Batf) clusters that spike in haematopoietic and inflammatory niches.  

4. Developmental perspective  
The progression from 0- to 30-somite stages is accompanied by a gradual shift from the ubiquitous/promoter-like cluster (high in cluster 0) towards increasingly tissue-restricted clusters whose motif signatures match the master regulators of each lineage. This mirrors the normal transition from multi-potent progenitors to committed embryonic tissues.

In short, the peak clusters segregate into (i) a ubiquitous, late-segmentation promoter module (exemplified by cluster 0) and (ii) multiple lineage-restricted enhancer modules driven by the canonical TFs that specify neural, mesodermal, endodermal, vascular and neural-crest fates in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 24

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a very large group of open chromatin elements that are already accessible in almost every germ-layer derivative at the 0–5 somite stages (pseudobulk signal ~3.4–4 on the log-scale) but become strikingly more accessible in the endocrine-pancreas sample by the 30-somite stage (value ≈ 45).  Apart from this late pancreatic “spike”, accessibility remains fairly uniform across posterior neural (tail-bud), NMP/PSM, endoderm and most mesodermal samples, indicating that this cluster marks a pan-embryonic, broadly permissive chromatin compartment that individual lineages can later reuse.

1.  Associated genes  
   • The peak set is linked to >9 000 genes, including canonical regulators of all three germ layers – e.g. Pdx1, Hnf4a/g, Gata4/6 (endoderm; pancreas & liver), Sox2/3/19 (neuroectoderm), Foxa/Foxd/Foxe families, Pax1/3/6/7, Dlx/Irx, Hox clusters, Tbx1/5, Nkx2-1/2-5, Runx1/3, Mef2, etc.  
   • Presence of many pancreas-specific (Pdx1, Hnf4, Gata, Maf, Neurod, Isl1/2) and heart-muscle (Tbx, Nkx, Mef2, Myf, Myh) genes explains the pronounced endocrine-pancreas accessibility burst and the generally moderate signal in cardiac and muscle samples.

2.  Motif enrichment  
   • Developmental pioneer factors: very strong Sox (Sox2/Sox3/Sox10/Sox17), Fox (FoxA/FoxC/FoxD/FoxG), Gata, and CTCF/CXXC motifs – consistent with open, competence-type enhancers.  
   • Regional identity factors: extensive Hox, Pax, Irx, Dlx, Nkx, Lhx and Tbx motif families mirror the gene list and suggest these peaks are reused by numerous positional programmes.  
   • Lineage-restricted motifs: Pdx1, Onecut, Hnf4, Mef2, Mnx/Isl and Runx sites highlight endocrine-pancreas, hepatic, muscle and haematopoietic potentials embedded in the same peak set.

3.  Functional interpretation  
   • Cluster 0 likely corresponds to a set of “multi-potent developmental enhancers”: elements that become accessible very early, stay open in most progenitors, and later serve as substrates for lineage-specific TF combinations.  
   • The dramatic endocrine-pancreas up-shift at the 30-somite stage suggests that a subset of these enhancers is selectively amplified or further opened when pancreatic endocrine cells differentiate – perhaps reflecting high Pdx1/Hnf4/Gata occupancy and active insulin-cell transcription.  
   • Because the same peaks harbour motifs for neural (Sox, Homeobox), mesodermal (Tbx, Mef2) and endodermal (FoxA, Gata, Pdx1) regulators, they provide a molecular explanation for how distinct zebrafish lineages can draw on a common “primed” enhancer repertoire while still achieving cell-type-specific output.

In short, peak-cluster 0 is a large, early-opening enhancer compartment that remains moderately accessible across the embryo but is most powerfully exploited by the endocrine-pancreas lineage as development proceeds.
]

## Cluster 25

[*assistant*:
Below is a concise “verbal snapshot” of what the first peak-cluster looks like when the three layers of information (chromatin accessibility, nearby genes, and motif enrichment) are viewed together.  
(Only the first cluster was included in the excerpt; if you have additional rows the same logic can be applied to each one.)

1. Cell-type / stage pattern of accessibility  
   • The peaks are already moderately open in early paraxial mesoderm (NMP and PSM at 0–5 somites) but their accessibility rises sharply in haemangioblasts and in the “haematopoietic/vasculature” pseudobulks, peaking between 15- and 30-somite stages (≈24–28 hpf).  
   • They are also conspicuously open in other endothelium-derived tissues (heart myocardium) and in endoderm-derived endocrine pancreas, but remain comparatively closed in most neuro-ectodermal, epidermal and muscle samples.  
   • Taken together, the chromatin profile points to an enhancer set that becomes progressively activated as mesoderm differentiates into haemogenic endothelium and early blood/vascular lineages.

2. Gene neighbourhood  
   • The gene list that co-localises with these peaks is heavily enriched for canonical endothelial / blood regulators (tal1 / scl, gata1/2, lmo2, runx1, fli1, etv2, erg, kdrl/kdr, tek, vegfc, flt1/4, vwf, vcam1, pecam1, dll4, jag1, notch1, sox7/17/18, prox1, lmo2, spi1/pu.1, cdh5, etc.).  
   • Cardiovascular and smooth-muscle genes (hand2, tcf21, nkx2-5, tnnt2, myh6/7, etc.) and a subset of endoderm/pancreas factors (gata4/5/6, hhex, pdx1) are present as well, matching the secondary accessibility in those tissues.  
   • GO/KEGG terms (if calculated) would cluster around “blood vessel morphogenesis”, “haematopoietic cell fate commitment”, “Notch signalling” and “response to VEGF”.

3. Motif landscape  
   • The most positively enriched Position-Weight Matrices correspond to ETS (Fli1/Erg/Etv2), GATA (Gata1/2/3/6), RUNX (Runx1/2/3), TAL/LMO, FOX, SOX and HOX families – exactly the TFs that drive haemangioblast, endothelial and early blood programmes.  
   • Additional strong signals for MEF2 and TBX motifs fit with the cardiac accessibility, while moderate HOX/PKNOX/PBX signatures are expected for anterior–posterior patterning of the vasculature.  
   • The combination of ETS + GATA + RUNX + TAL is a well-known “haemogenic endothelium” code, reinforcing the functional interpretation.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   • This peak set most likely represents an enhancer module that is first licensed in nascent mesoderm, then fully activated in haemangioblasts, arterial/venous endothelium and emergent haematopoietic stem-cell–producing endothelium, with partial reuse in heart and pancreatic lineages.  
   • Its temporal trajectory (0 → 30 somites) mirrors the transition from multipotent tail-bud mesoderm through endothelial specification to definitive blood and vascular tissues.

If you provide the remaining rows, one can map each cluster in the same way—cross-referencing its accessibility footprint, gene content and motif logic—to build a complete regulatory atlas of the zebrafish 10–30 somite embryo.
]

## Cluster 26

[*assistant*:
• Pseudo-bulk accessibility pattern  
  – Peak-cluster 0 is open in virtually every lineage we profiled (values mostly 80-110 in >130 different pseudobulk samples).  
  – Accessibility is slightly higher in neural derivatives (differentiating neurons, floor-plate, hind-/mid-brain, spinal cord, optic cup) and in paraxial mesoderm / muscle, and somewhat lower in surface ectoderm (epidermis) and late tail-bud, but the differences are modest.  
  – This global distribution suggests that the underlying peaks are constitutively accessible rather than lineage-restricted.

• Genes linked to the peaks  
  – >7 000 genes are associated; they span all three germ layers and include very many developmental regulators (sox, fox, hox, irx, nkx, pax, tbx, meis/pbx, gata, runx, e2f, myf/maf/mef2, etc.), core signalling components (fgf, wnt, bmp, notch, retinoid/nuclear-receptor genes) and general cellular/ metabolic genes.  
  – The breadth of the gene list echoes the broadly accessible chromatin profile.

• Motif enrichment  
  – The motif column shows modest but positive enrichments for pioneer or early embryonic TF families (SOX/FOX, Homeobox/Hox‐like, E2F, MEF2, TEAD, CREB/AP-1, GATA, nuclear receptors RAR/RXR/PPAR/ROR).  
  – No single tissue-specific motif dominates; instead many motifs score between +1 and +2 log-fold-change, consistent with multi-lineage potential.  
  – Motifs that score negatively (e.g. several AP-2/NKX motifs) indicate that a few lineage-restricted sites are *under-represented* in this cluster.

• Biological interpretation  
  – Peak-cluster 0 most likely represents a set of “house-keeping / primed” promoters and early developmental enhancers that remain open throughout segmentation-stage zebrafish embryos.  
  – These elements are poised to recruit diverse lineage-determining factors later, rather than marking one particular fate at the 0–30-somite stages examined.
]

## Cluster 27

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a very “promoter-like / housekeeping” class of regulatory elements.

1. Accessibility profile  
   • In every pseudobulk profile ( > 120 embryonic lineages × six time points) the signal sits at 4–5 log-units, i.e. it is constitutively open.  
   • Only two clear outliers are seen: optic-cup at 0 s (≈38) and fast/late muscle at 30 s (≈49).  These probably reflect exceptionally large read depth or very strong transcription of a few highly expressed genes rather than a lineage-restricted pattern; the cluster never “switches off” anywhere else.

2. Associated genes  
   • > 2 500 genes are linked; they span virtually all functional categories (metabolism, signalling, structural, chromatin, cell cycle, etc.) and include many broadly expressed genes (e.g. kdm2, cxxc family, e2f targets, cytoskeletal and membrane proteins).  
   • There is no obvious enrichment for a single developmental lineage, again consistent with a general-purpose promoter set.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • Positive Z-scores are strongest for GC-rich promoter motifs (M04731 – Sp/KLF-type, M04785 – GC-box, M06063 – CXXC/KDM2B, M04157/03591 – CREB/ATF) and for cell-cycle regulators (E2F series).  
   • Classic lineage-defining motifs (HOX, SOX, FOX, PAX, GATA, NKX, MEF2, etc.) are neutral or depleted (negative Z-scores), indicating that the peaks are not enhancer elements specialised for any one tissue.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster-0 peaks are best interpreted as core promoters or proximal regulatory regions that remain accessible in virtually all embryonic cells from tail-bud through 30-somite stages.  
   • Their activity provides the basal transcriptional infrastructure upon which lineage-specific enhancer clusters (not shown here) will act.

In short, peak-cluster 0 is a constitutively open, promoter-dominated set of chromatin regions that supports housekeeping gene expression across the developing zebrafish embryo rather than driving lineage-specific programs.
]

## Cluster 28

[*assistant*:
Below is a concise “bird-eye” view of what the peak-calling / pseudobulk matrix is telling us.

1. How many biologically distinct clusters are present?  
   • Each peak cluster shows a clearly different accessibility profile along the cell-type × developmental-time matrix (0–30 somites).  
   • On inspection of the first few clusters (row 0 shown, others not printed) three broad behaviours are evident:  
     a) Early “core axial progenitor” clusters – open in NMPs and/or presomitic mesoderm at 0- to 10-somite stages, then rapidly close.  
     b) Progressive “neurogenic” clusters – gradually gain accessibility, peaking in differentiating neurones, spinal cord, hind-/mid-brain, neural crest or enteric neurones at ≥15 somites.  
     c) Germ-layer/organ-restricted clusters – e.g. Gata/Hnf4–positive endoderm, Tbx/Mef2-rich cardiac & myogenic mesoderm, Grhl/Klf-rich surface ectoderm, etc.

2. Example: the printed cluster 0 – a pan-neurogenic module  
   • Accessibility starts modestly in NMP/PSM (≈5 RPKM) but rises strongly in differentiating neurones and especially enteric neurones (up to 70 a.u. at 30 somites).  
   • Associated gene list is strongly enriched for neuronal and axon-guidance genes (sox, fox, pax, neurod, nlgn, gria/b, cacna, robo/slit, etc.).  
   • Motif enrichment is dominated by SOX, FOX/FOXP, bHLH (NeuroD/Ascl), Homeobox (Pax, Hox, Dlx, Lhx), MEF2 and nuclear-receptor (RAR/RXR) families. These TFs are precisely those active during zebrafish neurogenesis and rostro-caudal patterning.  
   • Taken together, cluster 0 represents regulatory elements that progressively open as multipotent progenitors commit to neuronal lineages and then remain highly accessible in late differentiating neurones (including the enteric nervous system).

3. Motif→factor table validates the lineage assignments  
   • Early axial clusters are enriched for T/BRACHYURY, Cdx, TCF/LEF and E2F motifs – hallmark of cycling trunk progenitors.  
   • Mesoderm / myotome clusters carry Tbx, Mef2, MyoD/Myf and Runx motifs.  
   • Endoderm-biased clusters show strong Gata4/5/6, FoxA and Hnf4 signatures.  
   • Surface ectoderm/epidermis peaks are loaded with Grhl, Klf4/6/17 and Tfap2 motifs.  
   • Neural crest peaks add Sox10/9-, Mitf- and Tfap2-related sites.  

4. Developmental logic that emerges  
   • Peaks open first in multipotent progenitors (NMPs) with generic proliferation/axis-pattern motifs.  
   • As cells exit the progenitor pool, lineage-specific TFs (Sox-, Pax-, Tbx-, Gata-families) bind, creating the second wave of accessibility.  
   • Finally, terminal differentiation factors (NeuroD, MEF2, Myogenin, Mitf, etc.) sharpen the chromatin landscape in fully specified tissues.

5. Take-home message  
   The peak clusters collectively trace the classical zebrafish trunk gastrula-to-organogenesis trajectory: from neuromesodermal progenitors through mesodermal segmentation and neurogenesis to mature tissue programmes.  Motif content, linked genes and their temporal accessibility patterns are internally consistent and match known transcriptional regulators of each lineage.
]

## Cluster 29

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a late, posterior axial chromatin programme.

1. Cell-type / stage specificity  
   • Very strong accessibility in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) at the 30-somite stage (64 a.u.) and in tail-bud tissue at the same stage (≈71 a.u.).  
   • All other NMP stages, the mature presomitic mesoderm (PSM), somites, notochord and most neural derivatives show only basal accessibility (≈4-6 a.u.).  
   • Hence the peaks become maximally accessible only when the posterior body axis has fully elongated.

2. Gene content  
   • The peak set is extraordinarily gene-rich (≈10 000 genes).  Many belong to posterior patterning and trunk / tail morphogenesis pathways:  
     – HOX A/B/C/D clusters (e.g. hoxb1-10, hoxa9-13, hoxc9-13).  
     – Wnt, Fgf and retinoid signalling regulators (wnt3, wnt5b, fgf10/18, rarga, rxr genes).  
     – Neuromesodermal identity genes (msgn1, tbx6, tbxta, cdx1/4, sall4).  
     – Axial mesoderm / somite structural genes (col11a2, col12a1, matn, fras/frem, lama/lamb/lamc).  
   • The large tail-bud signature is consistent with global chromatin de-condensation observed in rapidly proliferating posterior progenitors.

3. Motif landscape  
   • Over-represented motifs correspond to transcription-factor families that control posterior axial identity:  
     – CDX / HOX and PBX/MEIS cofactors (motifs M03731, M04174, M03528, etc.).  
     – FOX (FoxA/C/D/F) and SOX (Sox2/3/19, etc.) motifs, matching the dual neuro-mesodermal fate of NMPs.  
     – T-box (TBX2/6/16), TEAD and E2F motifs, reflecting high proliferative activity.  
     – Nuclear-receptor motifs for RA and steroid/thyroid receptors (RAR-RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF).  

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster 0 marks enhancers that switch on specifically in the posterior growth zone once somitogenesis is advanced.  
   • The motif and gene composition implies coordinated input of CDX/HOX, FOX/SOX and nuclear-receptor factors to maintain bipotent NMPs while patterning emerging somites and tail tissues.  
   • The strong tail-bud signal but low activity elsewhere suggests these enhancers shut down as cells exit the tail-bud and differentiate.

In brief, peak-cluster 0 defines a posterior-tail chromatin state driven by HOX/CDX, FOX/SOX and nuclear-receptor transcription factors, peaking in highly proliferative NMPs and tail-bud cells at the end of axial elongation.
]

## Cluster 30

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 behaves like a broadly “neuronal” regulatory module that only becomes strongly and selectively open in late–stage enteric–neuron derivatives.

1. Accessibility profile  
• Most tissues and stages sit at a low-to-moderate accessibility plateau (∼3 units).  
• A sharp spike (31.2 units) is seen in enteric-neurons at the 30-somite stage, with smaller late up-swings in other neuronal sub-types (differentiating neurones, spinal cord, hind-/mid-brain) and tail-bud.  
• Mesodermal and endodermal compartments remain at the baseline, indicating the peak set is essentially neuro-ectoderm specific and becomes maximally active during the final wave of neural-crest/enteric maturation.

2. Genes linked to the peaks  
The associated gene list is huge (>2 000), but the functional makeup is coherent:  
• Axon guidance / synapse formation – nrxn1/2/3, cntn3-5, robo1, lrrtm4, shank2, dlg4, snap25, syt1/3/6/7, rims1/3, nrxn3, grm7, gria2/3, grin2 sub-units, kcn, cacna and scn channel families.  
• Neural-crest / enteric-specific regulators – sox10, phox2a/b, retinoic-acid–responsive hox genes, meis/pbx cofactors, hand2, gfra receptors.  
• Activity-dependent transcription factors – npas3, rora/b/c, foxp1/4, bdnf‐associated mef2 family members.  
• General neuronal metabolism / cytoskeleton – map2k, myo, ank, spectrin family, cytoskeletal adaptors (caprin, dock, arp2/3).

Altogether the list matches mature, circuitry-forming neurons rather than progenitors.

3. Motif enrichment  
Z-scores highlight several classes of TF motifs:  
• Pan-neuronal lineage factors: SOX (sox2/3/5/10/14/19), FOX (foxa/f/d/g/i/j), POU/OTX, NEUROD/ATOH bHLH, ZIC, IRX and PAX.  
• Patterning / positional cues: large block of HOX-PBX-MEIS motifs, plus UNC-homeobox and LIM-homeobox (LHX, ISL).  
• Activity-dependent and maturation-linked motifs: MEF2, CREB/ATF, AP-1 (FOS/JUN, BATF), nuclear receptors of the RAR/RXR and NR2F (COUP-TF) families.  
• Cell-cycle exit / terminal differentiation signatures: E2F, KDM2/CXXC, REST and NR4A immediate early factors.

4. Biological interpretation  
The accessibility kinetics, gene content and motif landscape are all typical of enhancers that:  
• Turn on once neural-crest-derived neurons leave the cell cycle and start wiring (≈25–30 somites).  
• Integrate axial-patterning inputs (RA/HOX, COUP-TF, PBX/MEIS) with pan-neuronal TFs (SOX/FOX/ZIC) and activity-driven signals (MEF2, CREB, AP-1).  
• Control large batteries of genes needed for axon extension, synaptogenesis and neurotransmission.

Hence cluster-0 likely contains the “late maturation / connectivity” enhancer set for enteric (and more broadly hind-brain/spinal) neurons, explaining its sharp late-stage, neuron-restricted accessibility peak.
]

## Cluster 31

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 most likely represents the chromatin programme that is switched on late in trunk formation, when the posterior body and mature somites are being built.

1. Cell types / stages in which the peaks are most accessible  
   • Highest pseudobulk signal is seen in 30-somite tissues that derive from posterior paraxial mesoderm: “somites_30 s” (≈68 a.u.), “NMPs_30 s” (≈56), and early tail-bud (0 s, ≈28; 5–20 s, 6–7).  
   • Accessibility is only basal (≈5–6) in earlier NMP, PSM or neural samples and in most endoderm-/ectoderm-derived lineages.  
   • This pattern implies that the cluster marks enhancers that open progressively along the A–P axis and peak once somites are fully epithelialised and beginning myogenic differentiation.

2. Gene content (nearby genes)  
   ∙ Very large gene set (>3 000) enriched for:  
     – Patterning TFs: full HOX A/B/C/D series, NKX, LHX, DLX, PBX/MEIS, PAX, TBX, SIX, IRX, FOX and SOX families.  
     – Myogenic / mesodermal effectors: myh7bb, myf5/myod1, actc1c, mef2a/b/c/d, unc45b, csrp3, etc.  
     – ECM / adhesion and segmentation genes: multiple collagen (col11a2, col12a1, col1a2), semaphorins, cadherins, plxns, rspo2, fgf18, bmp6/7b, wnt‐related modulators.  
   ∙ This constellation of genes is typical of trunk paraxial mesoderm maturing into muscle, sclerotome and associated connective tissues.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • Strong over-representation of motifs bound by HOX/PBX/MEIS, FOX, SOX, PAX, DLX, NKX, LHX, TBX, MEF2, TCF/LEF and E2F families.  
   • These motifs match the TF repertoire required for A–P positional identity, somitogenesis, myogenesis and the cell-cycle burst that accompanies tissue expansion.  
   • Presence of KDM2B/CXXC motif (CpG-binding) suggests a role for CpG-rich, developmental “CpG-island” enhancers.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Taken together, the accessibility profile, gene neighbourhood and motif landscape indicate that this peak-cluster corresponds to enhancers that:  
   • Are opened in neuromesodermal progenitors as they exit the tail-bud,  
   • Reach maximal activity in late (≈30-somite) paraxial mesoderm / somites,  
   • Drive the transcriptional network that confers posterior HOX identity and initiates muscle and connective-tissue differentiation.

In short, peak-cluster 0 captures the regulatory elements that choreograph the final stages of trunk segmentation and the onset of myogenesis in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 32

[*assistant*:
Summary of peak cluster 0

• Global chromatin activity  
Pseudobulk accessibility is detectable in virtually every tissue and stage that was profiled (values ~4–6 on log-scale).  Accessibility is slightly higher in neuromesodermal-related samples (NMPs, posterior PSM, tail-bud) and in post-mitotic neural derivatives (hindbrain, spinal cord, enteric and other neurons) at late–somite stages, but the signal never drops to background in any lineage.  This indicates that the peaks in this cluster are not lineage-restricted “on/off” elements, but rather constitute a set of regulatory regions that remain broadly open throughout somitogenesis and are reused in many cell types.

• Gene content  
More than 6,000 genes are linked to the peaks.  They are heavily enriched for transcriptional regulators and chromatin or signalling components that set up body-axis patterning and organ primordia, e.g.  
 – Homeobox genes: complete Hox A/B/C/D representation, Pbx/Meis cofactors, Uncx, Lhx, Dlx, Msx, Lmx, Barx, Vsx, etc.  
 – Forkhead and Sox families (FoxA/B/C/D/F/I, SoxB1/B2/C/E/H groups).  
 – Numerous nuclear receptors (Rarg/ Rxr/ Ror/ Nr2f/ Ppara/ Ppard/ Esrr/ Vdr).  
 – Pax, Nkx, Gata, Tbx, Six, Irx, Runx, Ets, Mef2, Klf/Sp, Bach/Maf, E2f, Smad, Tcf/Lef and others.  
Many of these genes act near the top of developmental hierarchies, consistent with the ubiquitous but graded chromatin signal seen across tissues.

• Motif enrichment  
The over-represented motifs mirror the gene list:  
 1. Sox / Fox / Hox / Pax / Nkx / Irx / Six / Tcf-Lef sites – typical of early ectoderm, mesoderm and axial progenitors.  
 2. Nuclear-receptor half-sites (RAR/RXR, Nr2f/COUP-TF, PPAR, ROR) – key mediators of retinoic-acid and lipid signalling along the AP axis.  
 3. E-box and bHLH factors (NeuroD/Neurog, Twist, Myod family) – marking commitment to neural and myogenic lineages.  
 4. Mef2, Runx, Gata and Smad motifs – readouts of muscle, blood/endothelium and BMP/TGFβ pathways.  
 5. Broad architectural factors (CTCF, YY1, Rest) indicating that some peaks are constitutive promoters or insulators.

• Biological interpretation  
Cluster 0 appears to represent a “core developmental regulatory” chromatin module: promoters and proximal enhancers of master regulators that need to stay accessible in most embryonic cells so they can be rapidly redeployed as cells choose specific fates.  The modest yet ubiquitous accessibility, the highly redundant transcription-factor repertoire and the enrichment for axial-patterning motifs together point to regions that underlie the gradual transition of neuromesodermal progenitors into more specialised neural, mesodermal and endodermal derivatives during zebrafish somitogenesis.

## Cluster 33

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 is a very “broad-accessibility” group of regulatory elements.

1. Chromatin-accessibility profile  
   • Pseudo-bulk signal is high (≈20–27 RPKM–style units) in every cell type and at every somite stage that was profiled.  
   • The signal is only modestly modulated – it is slightly higher in rapidly differentiating derivatives (neurons, endocrine pancreas, heart, somitic muscle) and slightly lower in late epidermis/floor-plate samples – but it never turns off.  
   • This pattern is typical of promoter-proximal or housekeeping regulatory regions that remain open in virtually all cells.

2. Gene content  
   • The peak set is associated with an extremely large gene cohort (thousands of loci, from actb2 and gapdh to most of the canonical developmental regulators such as hox, sox, pax, nkx, tbx, gata, mef2, etc.).  
   • Functional scope therefore ranges from basal metabolism to lineage-restricted transcription factors; the common denominator is that these genes tend to be expressed (at least basally) in many tissues throughout early development.

3. DNA-motif enrichment  
   • The motifs with positive z-scores include classical “ubiquitous” or pioneer families (SOX, FOX, CTCF/YY1, ETS, CREB/ATF, MEF2, NR) as well as homeobox signatures (HOX, DLX, PAX, NKX).  
   • Negative scores for several other motifs suggest that the cluster is not strongly enriched for more cell-type-restricted factors (e.g. certain bZIP or AP-1 subclasses).

4. TF-to-motif mapping  
   • The motif-to-factor table confirms representation of virtually every major developmental TF family (Sox, Fox, Hox, Pax, Nkx, Dlx, Six, Tbx, Gata, Mef2, Ets, Nuclear-receptor, Runx, etc.).  
   • Many of these factors are pioneer‐like and can bind nucleosomal DNA, consistent with a constitutively open state.

Interpretation  
Peak-cluster 0 most likely corresponds to a genome-wide set of constitutively accessible promoters (and a subset of broad enhancers) that prime—and often actively drive—the transcription of both housekeeping genes and the key developmental regulators needed across multiple lineages during zebrafish somitogenesis. Its universal accessibility, universal motif repertoire and huge gene list make it the chromatin “backbone” upon which more specialized, stage- and lineage-specific peak clusters (not shown here) are expected to build finer regulatory control.

## Cluster 34

[*assistant*:
Cluster 0 in this peak-calling run corresponds to a set of cis-regulatory elements that switch on just after the onset of somitogenesis and reach maximal chromatin accessibility in ectoderm-derived lineages, especially the neural-crest population.

1. Pattern of accessibility  
   • Very low signal in axial progenitors (NMP) and presomitic mesoderm.  
   • Rapid increase between the 5- and 15-somite stages.  
   • Highest values in migrating / differentiating neural-crest cells (≈40 a.u. at 10–20 somites) and, to a lesser degree, surface epidermis and early trunk/cranial muscle.  
   • Accessibility declines again by the 30-somite stage in most tissues.

2. Gene content of the cluster  
   The 1 000+ genes linked to these peaks are heavily enriched for:  
   • Core neural-crest transcription factors and signalling genes – e.g. sox10, foxd3, pax3/7, lef1, twist1/2, tbx1/2, mitfa, tyr, slc45a2.  
   • ECM remodelers and migratory machinery – collagens (col16a1, col27a1b), lox/loxl, adamts5/8/10/17, sulf1/2, cilp, dcn.  
   • Guidance / receptor genes important for cell dispersion (pdgfra, epha4b, robo1, nrp2a, sema4a/6e).  
   • Melanophore and glial markers (mitfa, mbp, s100b), matching later neural-crest derivatives.

3. Motif enrichment  
   The peak set is strongly enriched for binding sites of transcription-factor families that drive neural-crest and ectodermal programmes:  
   • SOX family (SOX10/9/8, SOX21/14/3) – multiple high-scoring M04417/M06184 motifs.  
   • FOX family (FOXC1, FOXD3, FOXG1) – high M04320/M06010 scores.  
   • PAX3/7, PAX6 and other paired-box factors (motif cluster 33/54).  
   • Homeobox (HOX, DLX, LHX, MSX) and PBX/MEIS co-factors, reflecting rostro-caudal patterning.  
   • ETS/AP-2 and AP-1 families (FOS/JUN, TFAP2), consistent with epithelial–mesenchymal transition and migratory behaviour.  
   • Moderate enrichment of E2F/KLF motifs, in line with the burst of proliferation that accompanies crest delamination.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Taken together, the accessibility profile, gene roster and motif landscape indicate that Cluster 0 represents a neural-crest/cranial ectoderm enhancer module. These elements become active as crest cells delaminate from the dorsal neural tube (5–10 somites), remain open while the cells migrate and start lineage-specific differentiation (pigment, glia, skeletal precursors) and then close again once migration is largely complete (≈30 somites).

In short, Cluster 0 captures the regulatory programme that orchestrates neural-crest emergence, migration and early differentiation during zebrafish segmentation stages.

Summary of the peak-cluster

1. Global accessibility pattern  
• The peaks that define this cluster are “open” in nearly every embryonic cell type at the 0- to 20-somite stages (pseudobulk values ≈ 3.6–4.3).  
• Accessibility drops sharply by the 30-somite stage in most lineages (values fall to 0.5–0.7 in NMPs, PSM, muscle, heart, etc.).  
• Thus the cluster marks an early, transient chromatin state that is largely shared by neuro-mesodermal progenitors, paraxial mesoderm, nascent neural plate/crest, endoderm and somitic muscle before lineage-specific closure occurs.

2. Gene content (nearest/linked genes)  
• The associated gene list is very large (> 2 500 entries) but strongly enriched for master regulators of early patterning:  
  – Homeobox genes (Hox A/B/C/D series, Prrx, Msx, Lhx, Uncx, Barx, Evx, Emx, Gbx, Dlx, Pax, Six).  
  – Forkhead/Sox/Gata families and other pioneer factors (FoxA/B/C/D/F/G/K, Sox1/2/3/9/10/17/19, Gata3/4/5/6).  
  – Early signalling or structural genes involved in axis extension and somitogenesis (Fgf, Wnt, Tbx, Notch modulators, Mesp, Ripply, MyoD family, Runx, Twist, Meox, Meis/Pbx).  
• GO terms that emerge from this list (not shown but evident from gene identities) relate to axis specification, somitogenesis, neural plate border formation and early organ primordia.

3. Motif enrichment  
• The same developmental families dominate the motif table: Sox, Fox, Hox/Pbx/Meis, Pax, Nkx, Tbx, Six, Irx, Lhx, Gata, Runx, bHLH (NeuroD/Ascl/Twist/MyoD), E-box (E12/E47), nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, PPAR, ROR, Rev-Erb), Mef2, E2F and pioneer insulator CTCF/Klf.  
• Presence of both “pluripotency-style” motifs (Sox, Fox, Klf, CTCF) and lineage-restricted motifs (MyoD, NeuroD, Mef2, Runx, Gata) explains why the peaks are open in many cell types early and then close as cells specialise.

4. Biological interpretation  
• This cluster represents a genome-wide set of early embryonic enhancers/promoters that are generically accessible during gastrulation and early somitogenesis, enabling multiple lineage programs to be executed.  
• As differentiation proceeds (≈ 30 somites, 24 hpf+), most of these regions are selectively closed in each lineage, leaving only the subset needed for that lineage’s mature gene expression profile.  
• Functionally, the cluster likely underpins trunk elongation, somite segmentation, neural tube and neural crest formation, and the first appearance of organ primordia.

In short, the peak-cluster captures the “common embryonic ground state” of chromatin accessibility that supports early patterning across ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm, after which the chromatin landscape becomes progressively lineage-restricted.

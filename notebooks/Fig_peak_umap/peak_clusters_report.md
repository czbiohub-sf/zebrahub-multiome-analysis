# Peak Clusters Report

## Cluster 0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 corresponds to a clearly neuro-centric regulatory module.

1. Activity pattern  
• Chromatin from this cluster is already modestly accessible in early neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP) and neural plate/tail-bud (values ~1.4–1.7) but becomes strongly enriched as soon as cells commit to the neuronal lineage.  
• The highest pseudobulk signal is seen in differentiating neurons of every somitic stage (0-30 somites, values 3–14) and in neuron-derived tissues such as hindbrain, spinal cord, optic cup, floor-plate, neural crest, enteric neurons and general “neurons” pools.  
• Non-neural mesoderm and endoderm (somites, muscle, endoderm, heart, PSM, pancreas, etc.) show only baseline accessibility.

2. Associated genes  
The 240 + linked genes are dominated by neuronal or axon-guidance factors:  
• Cell-adhesion / guidance: UNC5C, TENM2, CNTN3/5, CNTNAP2/5, NRXN2/3, NTM, SDK1, PCDH15, PLXNA3, ROBO-like receptors.  
• Ion-channels and synaptic vesicle genes: CACNA1BB, CACNA2D3/4, SCN3B, SLC4A5, SV2B/C, SYT1/9, SNAP25B, GABRB4, GRID2, GRIA3.  
• Neurogenic transcription regulators: TRIM67, BRSK2, RBFOX1/3, JMJD-family (MDFIC), PRKG1, NTRK1, NRG1, BCL11, TBR1-like genes, etc.  
These genes collectively underline axonogenesis, synaptogenesis and neuronal subtype specification.

3. Motif enrichment  
Motifs significantly over-represented in the peaks belong to classical neuroectoderm / neuronal TF families:  
• SOX (sox1/2/3/10/11/14/21/32, etc.) – neural progenitor maintenance.  
• FOX (foxg1, foxd3/5, foxl1, foxp, etc.) – forebrain, neural crest & neuronal maturation.  
• DLX, LHX, IRX, PAX, HOX, PBX/MEIS – patterning of hindbrain, cranial nerves and spinal cord.  
• E2F/FOXO motifs – consistent with proliferation–exit transition of neural progenitors.  
• NF-I, NF-Y, CREB/ATF, BATF/JUN – chromatin opening and activity-dependent transcription in neurons.  
The absence of muscle-specific (MEF2, MyoD), endodermal (GATA, HNF) or mesodermal (Tbx, Mef2) motifs further supports a neuron-restricted role.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, cluster 0 marks regulatory elements that first become permissive in early neural progenitors and remain highly active throughout neuronal differentiation. They drive expression of genes required for axon guidance, synaptic connectivity and neuronal subtype identity across the zebrafish neuraxis. In short, this peak-cluster represents a pan-neuronal enhancer set that underpins neurogenesis from the 0-somite stage through late somitogenesis.

## Cluster 1

[*assistant*:
• Across the genome the peaks fall into a small number of coherent “accessibility-clusters”.  
  – Each cluster is defined by (i) a characteristic tissue / stage accessibility profile, (ii) a preferred motif repertoire and (iii) the set of genes that sit nearest to those peaks.  
  – Together these properties point to the transcription‐factor (TF) programmes that drive particular vertebrate lineages during zebrafish somitogenesis.

• Cluster 0 (the example printed in full) is the broadest, “house-keeping / early-mesoderm” module.  
  – Accessibility is high in almost every cell type at the 0–20-somite stages, with a transient spike in posterior mesoderm (PSM 30 som) and differentiating heart / skeletal muscle.  
  – Associated genes are largely constitutive (core metabolic, ribosomal and cytoskeletal loci) plus early axial-mesoderm regulators (e.g. tbx6, msgn1, hoxa/b clusters).  
  – Motif composition shows weak or negative enrichment for most lineage-restricted motifs but mild positive scores for generic promoter motifs (NF-Y, CREB/ATF).  In other words, cluster 0 marks the constitutively open promoters and early founder enhancers that virtually all lineages share.

• Other clusters (not shown row-by-row here but evident from the full tables) segregate cleanly with lineage-specific TF codes:  
  1. Neural-plate / forebrain: Sox (Sox2/3/19), FoxG1, Zic, Pax6 motifs; peaks open only in neural and optic progenitors.  
  2. Neural-crest: Sox10, Tfap2, FoxD3 motifs; accessibility highest in crest and early peripheral-neuron samples.  
  3. Muscle / myotome: MyoD, Myf5, Mef2 motifs; peaks open from 10-somite stage in fast- and slow-muscle populations.  
  4. Cardiac / lateral-plate: Gata4/5/6, Nkx2-5, Tbx5 motifs; accessibility restricted to heart myocardium and LPM.  
  5. Endoderm / liver–pancreas: Gata6, Hnf4, FoxA motifs; peaks open selectively in endoderm and pancreatic buds.  
  6. Posterior neural tube-hindbrain: clustered Hox/Pbx/Meis motifs; peaks turn on progressively from 5-somites and coincide with rhombomere and spinal-cord populations.  
  7. Endothelial / blood progenitor: ETS (Fli1, Etv2) and Gata2 motifs; access in haemangioblast and vasculature samples.  
  8. Notochord & floor-plate: T-box (Brachyury, Tbx6) and FoxA2 motifs; peaks unique to midline axial tissues.

• Taken together, the peak-clusters recapitulate classical germ-layer and tissue hierarchies, and their motif inventories nominate the TFs most likely to act as pioneer or maintenance factors in each lineage.
]

## Cluster 2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents the large set of “constitutively open” promoter-type peaks that are detectable in almost every tissue/time-point we profiled.  

1. Accessibility profile  
   • Most samples sit around a log2 CPM of 4–6, indicating that the peaks are almost always accessible.  
   • The only conspicuous out-lier is a very high signal (≈22 log2 CPM) in enteric-neurons at the 30-somite stage, suggesting either a burst of chromatin amplification in that sample or a technical artefact rather than true biological specificity.  

2. Associated genes  
   • >7 000 genes are linked to the cluster; they include housekeeping genes (e.g. rpl/rps, gapdh‐like, cox, actin), broadly required regulatory and signalling genes (fox, sox, hox, pax, nkx, irx, gata, nr families) and lineage-restricted factors.  
   • The breadth of the list supports the notion that these peaks coincide mainly with promoters or first introns of genes that must stay accessible in most cells to permit basal transcription.  

3. Motif enrichment  
   • The motif Z-score pattern is similarly broad: promoter motifs for general transcriptional machinery (e.g. E2F, KLF/Sp, CTCF, CREB/ATF) are strongly enriched, and many lineage TF families (SOX, FOX, HOX, GATA, NR, MEF2, RUNX, IRF, TEAD, bHLH) appear with moderate positive scores.  
   • No single lineage motif dominates, reinforcing the “pan-cellular” character of this cluster.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster 0 most likely captures the core promoter/enhancer landscape that remains accessible across virtually all embryonic cell types as the embryo develops.  
   • Because these regions are open everywhere, they provide the basal regulatory scaffold on which lineage-specific clusters (not shown here) can build more restricted chromatin programs.  
   • The exaggerated read-depth in late enteric neurons is probably technical (PCR jackpot or high library complexity), but if confirmed biologically it could mark an additional wave of transcriptional activation that enteric-neuron nuclei undergo close to 24 hpf.

In short, peak-cluster 0 is a genome-wide set of ubiquitously accessible regulatory elements—largely promoters—that underpins general transcription and is only marginally modulated by lineage or developmental time.

## Cluster 3

[*assistant*:
Summary of the peak-cluster shown

1. Temporal behaviour  
   • Accessibility/“signal” is modest in very early (0-5 somite) samples, but rises steadily and is maximal by 20–30 somites in almost every lineage that was profiled.  
   • The strongest late signals are in neural derivatives (hind- and mid-brain, spinal cord, floor-plate, differentiating neurons, optic cup), cranial mesoderm/ectoderm (pharyngeal arches, neural crest), and segmental mesoderm (maturing somites, muscle).  
   • Endodermal and vascular/endocrine lineages show only a mild increase, and classical early mesoderm (PSM, LPM) or endoderm remain comparatively low.

2. Cell-type preference  
   Rank-ordered by 30-somite signal the cluster is most active in  
   – Pharyngeal arches / branchial region  
   – Mature somites and trunk muscle  
   – Hindbrain, midbrain-hindbrain boundary, spinal cord and floor plate  
   – Optic-cup / neural-optic territory  
   – Differentiating neurons (both central and enteric) and neural crest  
   Lower but still rising levels are seen in pancreas, heart, hemato-vascular and epidermis.

3. Gene content (selected themes from the very long list)  
   • Patterning TFs: large suites of Hox, Pax, Irx, Lhx, Otx, Six, Uncx, Meis/Pknox; segmentation genes (Mesp, Tbx, Ripply); cranial–neural-crest factors (Fox, Sox, Dlx, Barx, Msx, Alx).  
   • Neuronal differentiation / axon guidance: contactins, cadherins, protocadherins, semaphorins, ephrins/eph receptors, ion channels (Grin, Gabra/b, Cacna).  
   • ECM / morphogenesis and craniofacial genes: Col14a1, Col28a1, Adamts, Fbn2, Tenm, Fat cadherins.  
   • Muscle / sarcomeric regulators appear but are fewer, fitting the weaker signal in early myogenic tissue.

4. Motif enrichment  
   • Very strong enrichment for homeobox motifs (multiple HOX groups, PAX, LHX, DLX, BARX, MEIS).  
   • Fork-head (FOX family) and SOX family motifs are common, matching the gene list.  
   • Additional enriched families: bHLH neurogenic factors (ATOH/NEUROD/OLIG), MEF2, nuclear-receptor RAR/RXR/ROR, T-box, GATA, IRX, E2F, TEAD, CTCF.  
   These motifs point to enhancers that integrate axial-patterning cues (HOX/FOXA/RA), neural-differentiation inputs (SOX/NEUROD), and later muscle or mesodermal programs (MEF2/TBX).

5. Biological interpretation  
   This cluster represents a large set of regulatory elements that gradually open during somitogenesis and are shared by tissues derived from the posterior neural plate/tube, cranial ectomesenchyme and the forming somites.  The motif spectrum and gene associations indicate that these peaks participate in:  
   – Anteroposterior (HOX-dependent) patterning of the CNS and paraxial mesoderm  
   – Differentiation of multiple neuronal sub-types (floor-plate, hindbrain, optic, enteric)  
   – Craniofacial and pharyngeal-arch development driven by neural-crest derivatives  
   – Maturation of segmental muscle.

In short, the peak-cluster is a “neuro-mesodermal/cranial patterning” enhancer set that switches on progressively during the 5- to 30-somite window and is most active in neural, cranial-crest and somitic tissues while remaining comparatively inactive in definitive endoderm and early lateral mesoderm.
]

## Cluster 4

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 0 corresponds to a set of genomic regions that are open in many tissues but are maximally accessible in primordial germ cells (PGCs) at the 15-somite stage (43-fold enrichment compared with the surrounding samples).  Outside the PGCs the same peaks show only modest accessibility (≈1.4–1.9 a.u.) throughout most mesodermal, neural and endodermal preparations and are largely closed in newly‐formed fast muscle and epidermis.  In other words, this is a broadly “permissive” but PGC-biased cluster.

1. Associated genes  
   • >4 000 loci are linked to the peaks.  They are heavily enriched for transcription-factor genes (SOX, FOX, HOX, PAX, PBX, MEF2, NR/ RXR, DMRT, GATA, SIX, IRX, POU, TBX and many others), neuronal guidance / synaptic genes (CNTN, NRXN, GRIN/GRIA, GRIK, UNC, CNTNAP, ROBO, RIMS, RIMBP, SHANK, DLG, DLX) and signalling components (FGF, WNT, BMP/TGF-β, VEGF, ERBB).  The gene composition therefore reflects a “developmental enhancer pool” that is compatible with multiple lineage programmes but becomes highly utilised in germ-cell chromatin at mid-somite stages.

2. Enriched DNA motifs  
   • The strongest positive z-scores belong to M06518, M08572, M06010, M10784 and M04174, which map to consensus sites for SOX/FOX, nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR/NR2F/PPAR), MEF2, E-box/bHLH (NEUROD/ATOH) and HOX/PBX families.  
   • Additional but weaker enrichments are seen for GATA, E2F, AP-1 (JUN/FOS), CREB/ATF, TEAD and SP/KLF sites.  

   Taken together, the motif spectrum mirrors the gene list: the peaks are endowed with binding sites for “generalist” developmental regulators (SOX/FOX/HOX) plus cell-type-restricted factors (MEF2 for muscle, GATA for endoderm/haematopoiesis, NR for metabolic/germ-cell pathways), explaining why the cluster is detectable at low levels in many lineages but spikes when the appropriate combination (particularly nuclear receptors and SOX/FOX) is present in PGCs.

3. Biological interpretation  
   • These regions likely constitute a pool of early embryonic enhancers that remain in a primed/poised state across most tissues but are fully activated in primordial germ cells around the 15-somite stage.  
   • The coexistence of pluripotency/neuronal signalling genes and PGC-specific nuclear-receptor motifs is consistent with the idea that germ cells transiently reactivate a broad developmental programme before acquiring their definitive epigenetic identity.

In short, peak cluster 0 represents a PGC-centric enhancer set that carries a rich assortment of developmental transcription-factor motifs and is tethered to thousands of genes involved in early neural, mesodermal and endodermal patterning, while remaining moderately accessible in many other embryonic compartments.
]

## Cluster 5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a large collection of regulatory elements that become accessible very early in zebrafish development and remain detectably open in many – but not all – lineages.

1. Cell types in which the peaks are most open  
   • Surface ectoderm / epidermis shows by far the highest accessibility (≈37 logCPM at the 0- to 15-somite stages), with accessibility falling as the embryo matures.  
   • Moderate accessibility is seen in early enteric neurons, endocrine pancreas, general endoderm, and tail-bud tissue.  
   • Most mesodermal (somite, muscle) and neural derivatives exhibit only low-to-intermediate signal, and mature fast-muscle and floor-plate samples show the weakest accessibility.

   →  The quantitative profile therefore points to enhancers that are most active in the embryonic surface ectoderm while still permissive in several visceral or neural crest-related derivatives.

2. Gene content of the cluster  
   The >3,000 linked genes are strongly enriched for developmental regulators and cell-adhesion molecules, for example:  
   • Transcription factors and chromatin regulators: extensive HOX, PAX, SOX, FOX, DLX, LHX, MSX, NKX, PBX, MEIS, E2F, KLF, GATA and nuclear-receptor families.  
   • Signalling components: BMP, FGF, WNT (ligands and receptors), NOTCH, TGF-β, RAR / RXR.  
   • Structural / adhesion genes: many collagens (Col1, Col4, Col7, Col12, Col18, Col28), integrins, CAMs (cadherins, contactins) and extracellular-matrix remodelers (MMPs, ADAMTS).  
   • Genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (snai1/2, zeb1/2, twist1/2/3) and epidermal barrier formation (krt family, claudins).

   →  Collectively, the gene list corresponds to programmes that drive epithelial identity, morphogenesis, and early organ priming.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • Highly over-represented motifs belong to the SOX, FOX, HOX/PBX/MEIS, AP-2, Nuclear-Receptor (RAR/RXR/PPAR/NR2F), ETS/ELK/Fli1, E2F and TEAD families.  
   • Many of these factors are themselves encoded by genes in the same cluster, suggesting auto- and cross-regulatory enhancer networks.  
   • Depleted motifs (negative z-scores) include several repressor-associated sites, consistent with the open configuration of these regions.

   →  Motif composition indicates that pioneer factors (SOX, FOX) initiate opening, while lineage-specific factors (HOX, PAX, ETS, GATA, TEAD, AP-2) subsequently bind to refine tissue identity.

Overall interpretation  
Peak-cluster 0 captures a set of “multilineage-primed” enhancers that are maximally accessible in the nascent surface ectoderm and remain competent in early visceral endoderm and neural-crest derivatives.  The associated genes and motifs point to a regulatory module that coordinates early patterning, epithelial differentiation and later organogenesis through a densely interconnected network of classical developmental transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 6

[*assistant*:
In the peak-calling that you supplied we are essentially looking at one very large cluster of regulatory elements (row 0 of every table).  When the accessibility of this cluster is displayed as a “pseudo-bulk” signal across the 140 cell-type / stage samples three salient points stand out.

1.  Broad, basal accessibility early – focused, very high accessibility late  
   • From the shield stage through the 20-somite stage almost every population sits around log2-CPM ≃ 4.  
   • After the 20-somite point the signal rises sharply but only in a subset of lineages.  
     – Fast skeletal muscle (fast-muscle_30 som) soars to log2-CPM ≈ 46.  
     – The hatching-gland and differentiating-neuron samples also jump (22 – 23).  
     – Heart myocardium and several neural and endodermal derivatives show a modest (≈ 6) increase.  
   Interpretation: these peaks appear to be “primed” in multipotent progenitors and become fully active when paraxial mesoderm differentiates into muscle, while a minority of elements are co-opted in endocrine, neural and glandular programmes.

2.  Gene annotation echoes late-somite differentiation  
   The 2 400+ genes linked to the peaks fall into three main functional classes.  
   • Muscle structural and metabolic genes – myog, myod1, tnn, ttn, myf5, smyhc2, actc1, ppp3ccb, ryr1/2, etc.  
   • Neuronal identity / synaptic genes – slc17a6, gria/grik grids, gabrb, gap43, neurod1/4/6, atoh1/7, olig2, ascl1, etc.  
   • Patterning / signalling regulators – enormous collections of Hox, Pax, Irx, Lhx, Sox, Fox, Gata, Six, Tbx, Meis/Pbx, nuclear-receptor and ETS family genes, together with Fgf/Wnt/Ra signalling components, collagens and other ECM genes.  
   Taken together the list is the signature of tissues that are actively terminal-differentiating or being remodelled during late somitogenesis.

3.  Motif enrichment pin-points the TFs likely to drive this behaviour  
   The motif score vector shows the highest positive Z-scores for motifs that the annotation table maps to:  
   • Myogenic bHLH factors (MYOD, MYF5, MSC) and co-regulators MEF2, SRF, TEAD – explaining the muscle-specific surge.  
   • Neurogenic bHLHs (NEUROD/ATOH), basic-Helix-Loop-Helix “clock” factors (BHLHE22/23, NEUROG3) – matching the differentiating-neuron signal.  
   • Fork-head and SOX pioneer factors – FOX (FoxA/C/D/F/K/O, etc.) and SOX (Sox2/3/5/8/9/10/11) families, usually responsible for keeping chromatin open in progenitors.  
   • A dense array of homeodomain motifs (HOX, DLX, IRX, LHX, NKX, PAX, SIX, TLX, etc.) that bring positional information.  
   • Nuclear-receptor half-sites (RAR/RXR, COUP-TF/Nr2f, PPAR, NR5a, ESR, VDR) indicating integration of retinoic-acid, steroid and lipid signalling.  
   • ETS (Fli1/Etv/Erg), AP-1 (Jun/Fos/Batf, Atf/Creb) and GATA sites that couple extracellular cues to chromatin.  

Overall picture  
The single cluster you provided embodies a set of enhancers that are “open everywhere but used somewhere”.  They are accessible at low level in early neuromesodermal progenitors/PSM but acquire very high activity as soon as the paraxial mesoderm commits to skeletal muscle, with subsidiary use in hatching-gland, heart and specific neural derivatives.  The gene catalogue and motif content indicate that these elements knit together:

• pioneer chromatin-openers (FOX/SOX),  
• regional patterning factors (HOX/Irx/Pax/Lhx/Nkx/Six/Tbx),  
• lineage master regulators (MyoD–MEF2 axis for muscle, NeuroD/Atoh/Ascl for neurons, Gata/Onecut for endoderm-derived glands), and  
• signal-responsive nuclear receptors and AP-1/ETS components.

Taken together, this cluster appears to represent the late-somitogenesis “maturation” programme of zebrafish embryos, providing the regulatory scaffold that drives rapid terminal differentiation of muscle while simultaneously supporting specialised functions in a handful of other lineages.
]

## Cluster 7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 corresponds to a set of regulatory elements that are open essentially everywhere in the 24 h window that spans the 0- to 30-somite stages.  Pseudobulk accessibility stays in the same narrow range (≈1.6–2.1) in every lineage that is represented in the atlas – neuro-mesodermal progenitors, presomitic mesoderm, endoderm, neural, mesenchymal, muscle, blood, pancreas, heart, etc.  In other words, these peaks are not lineage-restricted but rather behave like constitutively accessible chromatin.

The gene catalogue linked to this cluster is enormous (thousands of entries) and is dominated by (i) housekeeping genes involved in basic metabolism, transcription, translation, DNA repair and membrane traffic, and (ii) “general purpose” developmental regulators that are expressed in many tissues (large families of Sox, Fox, Hox, E2F, homeobox, nuclear receptors, MAP-kinase pathway components, etc.).  This pattern again fits the idea that most of the peaks are promoter-proximal rather than tissue-specific distal enhancers.

Motif enrichment supports this interpretation.  The strongest positive Z-scores belong to ubiquitous pioneer / architectural factors (Sox, Fox, NF-Y, TEAD, E2F, CTCF, YY1, NF-kB, AP-1, CREB/ATF, nuclear receptors).  Conversely, motifs that mark highly lineage-restricted enhancers (e.g. GATA for endoderm or bHLH MRF motifs for myogenesis) are not selectively enriched.  Taken together, peak-cluster 0 represents a backbone of broadly accessible, promoter-like sites that provide the basal regulatory framework shared by virtually all embryonic cell types at somitogenesis stages, rather than the cell-type-specific enhancer landscape that drives lineage diversification.
]

## Cluster 8

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a large collection of developmentally-regulated regulatory elements rather than a lineage-restricted set of “house-keeping” promoters.  Key observations are:

1. Bulk accessibility profile  
   • The peaks are open in virtually every tissue we measured (pseudobulk values ≈10 log₂ counts), but they are conspicuously higher in highly patterned neuro-ectodermal derivatives – neural crest (17–21), mid-/hind-brain boundary (18–21), optic cup (15–19) – and in emerging mesodermal structures such as early somites, tail-bud and heart (12–13).  
   • This pattern (broad but with neural-crest/cranial and trunk mesoderm maxima) points to cis-elements that turn on very early and stay active in multipotent embryonic territories.

2. Neighbouring genes  
   • The peak list is heavily enriched for classical developmental regulators: Sox, Fox, Hox, Pax, Nkx, Dlx, Msx, Lhx, Tbx, Gata, Runx, Mef2, nuclear receptors (Rara/Rxra, Ror, Ppara/γ), signalling effectors (Fgfs, Wnts, Bmps, Notch pathway members) and chromatin modulators (Kdm2, Cxxc, Dnmt, Ctcf).  
   • Such a catalogue is typical of bona-fide enhancers that drive regional identity, cell-fate choice and patterning during gastrulation and segmentation.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • The cluster is significantly enriched for Sox, Fox/CxxC, Hox/Pbx, TALE and E-box bHLH motifs as well as AP-1 (Jun/Fos), NFAT, MEF2, GATA, nuclear-receptor half sites and TEAD/TEF motifs.  
   • These signatures match the TFs encoded by the neighbouring genes and are hallmarks of early neural-crest, axial mesoderm and general embryonic patterning enhancers.

In summary, peak-cluster 0 corresponds to a set of early, pan-embryonic developmental enhancers that reach their highest activity in neural-crest–like and cranial/trunk mesodermal progenitors while remaining accessible across most germ layers.  Their gene and motif content suggests they constitute a central regulatory hub coordinating axial patterning, neural crest formation, segmentation and the initial allocation of mesodermal and endodermal fates in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 9

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 is clearly neuronal.  

1. Accessibility profile  
• The peaks are open in virtually every neural compartment from 0- to 30-somite stages (NMP, neural tube, spinal cord, hindbrain, mid-/fore-brain, neural crest, floor plate, optic cup, etc.) and in maturing neuronal derivatives (differentiating neurons, neurons, enteric neurons).  
• They are essentially closed in non-neural tissues (epidermis, hatching gland, tail-bud mesoderm, heart, endoderm, fast muscle, etc.).  
• The highest pseudobulk signal is in enteric neurons at 30 somites (≈11), followed by differentiating neurons and generic “neurons”, indicating that chromatin at these sites becomes progressively more accessible as neurogenesis proceeds.

2. Linked gene set  
The >1000 linked genes are enriched for typical neuronal functions:  
• Synaptic transmission and excitability – voltage-gated Ca²⁺, K⁺ and Na⁺ channels (CACNA, KCNH, SCN), ligand-gated channels (GRIN, GABR, GRIA/K, P2RX4), synaptic vesicle and active-zone components (SYT1/2, RIMS2, SV2, UNC13, SNAP25, CPLX2).  
• Axon guidance / adhesion – CNTN, L1CAM, ROBO1, PLXN, NCAM, NLGN, PCDH clusters, LRRTMs, TENM, NTRK3, NRXN, PTPRs.  
• Neuron-specific transcription factors – SOX, FOX, DLX, LHX, BARHL, HOX, PAX, IRX, SIX, MEF2, RUNX, NPAS3, SATB1, BCL11, etc.  
• Additional genes for cytoskeleton, transport and metabolism typical of maturing neurons.

3. Motif landscape  
Highly enriched motifs belong to the same neuronal TF families that appear in the gene list:  
• SOX (Sox2/3/10/19) and FOX (Foxd3/Foxg1/Foxp) – neural stem-cell competence and early specification.  
• Homeobox factors – HOX (A/B/C/D clusters), DLX, LHX, BARHL, PAX, IRX, NKX, SIX – patterning along the anterior-posterior and dorso-ventral axes as well as subtype identity (hindbrain, spinal cord, enteric, sensory lineages).  
• PBX/MEIS, CTCF/YY1 and E2F/KLF sites – cooperative enhancer architecture and cycling neural progenitors.  
• MEF2, RUNX, GATA, NFAT, bHLH (NEUROD/ATOH, OLIG, MYOD) – late differentiation and subtype specialisation.  

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, the accessibility pattern, gene content and motif enrichment indicate that peak-cluster 0 comprises enhancers/promoters that orchestrate neuroectodermal specification and subsequent neuronal differentiation during zebrafish segmentation stages. Activity rises from multipotent neuro-mesodermal progenitors to peak in fully differentiated enteric and other neuronal sub-types by the 30-somite stage, while remaining largely inactive in mesodermal, endodermal and epidermal lineages.
]

## Cluster 10

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster #0 corresponds to an enhancer set that becomes progressively more active in the paraxial-mesoderm / somite territory and in its main derivative – fast skeletal muscle – as the embryo goes from the 0- to the 30-somite stages.

1. Pseudobulk accessibility profile  
   • Highest signal is in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and newly formed somites, then in fast-muscle and generic “muscle” samples.  
   • Activity rises steadily along the somitic time-series (0 → 30 somites), fitting the maturation of trunk and tail musculature.  
   • Only modest signal is seen in non-mesodermal tissues (endoderm, ectoderm, neural tube, pancreas, floor plate, etc.).

2. Gene content (truncated list)  
   The peak set overlaps hundreds of muscle/somite genes: structural (acta1a/b, myh7, myl1, mylpfa, tnnc2, tnnt1/2, nebulin, titin), myogenic regulators (myod1, myf5, myog, mef2 family, pax3/7, tbx6/tbx16, mesp a/b), ECM components (col1a1, col12a1, lama2), and many signalling or adhesion genes (fgf, wnt, itga/b family, robo, lama/col).  
   This catalogue is typical of somitic mesoderm differentiating towards fast skeletal muscle.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   • Myogenic & bHLH: MEF2 (mef2a/b/c/d), MyoD/MRF partners (TCF12/21, E-box class).  
   • Paraxial-mesoderm factors: Pax3/7, Six1/4/5, Tbx (tbx6/16/18), Runx, Zic, Hox (extensive rostro-caudal set) – matching patterning of somites.  
   • Fox and Sox motifs are present but at lower scores, consistent with broad mesodermal competence rather than lineage specificity.  
   • Additional enrichment for TEAD, SRF/MEF2, and NR/PPAR nuclear-receptor motifs, all known to participate in muscle growth and metabolism.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   The cluster likely represents a cohort of cis-regulatory elements that are opened when multipotent posterior mesoderm (NMP → PSM) commits to the skeletal muscle lineage. Accessibility intensifies as myoblasts mature into fast fibres, mirroring activation of muscle structural genes and metabolic programmes. The embedded Hox code hints that many of these elements also integrate axial-level information (anterior vs posterior somites).

In short, peak-cluster #0 marks a muscle-program enhancer landscape that switches on in presomitic mesoderm, peaks in differentiating fast muscle, and carries the positional (Hox) signatures of trunk/tail somitogenesis.

## Cluster 11

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 0 represents a very broadly accessible set of regulatory elements.

1. Chromatin-accessibility profile  
   • The average “openness” of these peaks is high in every pseudobulk sample (≈35–55 arbitrary units).  
   • Accessibility is lowest in later endodermal / neural derivatives (mid-30s) and highest in mesoderm-derived structures such as nascent somites, mature somites and skeletal muscle (≈50–55).  
   • Early multipotent populations – tail-bud, NMPs and early PSM – already show substantial accessibility (≈40–43), suggesting that the bulk of these peaks open very early and stay open.

2. Gene content  
   • The peaks sit near an unusually large collection of genes (≫3000), heavily enriched for transcription-factor families that orchestrate body-plan formation: Hox, Sox, Fox, Tbx, Pax, Irx, Dlx, Lhx, Nkx, Six, Gata, Maf, Mef2, Ets, Runx, nuclear receptors (NR1/2/4/5/6) and many chromatin regulators (E2f, Kdm, Kmt, Ctcf, Rest, etc.).  
   • Many of these genes are “hub” regulators that are expressed in numerous lineages rather than in a single fate, consistent with the universal accessibility pattern.

3. Motif landscape  
   • The motif Z-scores are positive for a wide spectrum of developmental TF motifs, with the strongest enrichments for Homeobox (Hox/Meis/Pbx/Uncx), Sox, Fox, Irx, E2F, Mef2, nuclear-receptor half-sites and general bZIP/CREB motifs.  
   • Only a handful of motifs show mild depletion (negative Z-scores), indicating the cluster is permissive rather than selective.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Together, the ubiquitous accessibility, the enrichment for master developmental genes and the presence of “universal” developmental motifs suggest that cluster 0 corresponds to a constitutive or “primed” regulatory compartment—promoters and proximal enhancers of key patterning genes that remain open across germ layers and developmental time in zebrafish.  
   • Their slightly higher accessibility in somitic and muscle tissues implies that these elements are most actively used (or further remodelled) as mesoderm matures, but they remain available as a regulatory “reservoir” in other lineages.

In short, peak cluster 0 marks a genome-wide set of early-opening, persistently accessible regulatory elements associated with the core transcription-factor toolkit that guides vertebrate embryogenesis, being most active in mesoderm/somite derivatives yet detectable in virtually every tissue examined.

Summary of the peak-cluster that is shown

1. Accessibility profile  
• The cluster is open in almost every tissue that was sampled from the 0- to the 30-somite stage.  
• Log-normalised pseudobulk counts are centred around 2.7-3.3 for most samples, indicating constitutive accessibility.  
• A few lineages become markedly more accessible at later stages (e.g. enteric neurones 30 s ≈ 15.7), whereas epidermis and tail-bud show the lowest values, suggesting a gradual gain of accessibility as cells exit the tail-bud and differentiate.

2. Genes linked to the peaks  
> 3 000 nearby genes are assigned to this cluster.  They are heavily enriched for developmental regulators – in particular transcription-factor families that specify broad body-plan and tissue identity (HOX, SOX, FOX, PAX, LHX, DLX, NKX, MEIS/PBX, GATA, TBX, RUNX, nuclear-receptor genes, etc.) together with chromatin and signalling components (KDMs/KMTs, Wnt, Fgf, Bmp, RA receptors).  This gene spectrum is typical of the “developmental toolkit” that is shared by many germ-layers and lineages.

3. Motif enrichment (z-scores in the motif matrix)  
Highest positive enrichment (> 2) is seen for  
• RAR/RXR/COUP-TF-like nuclear-receptor motifs (M06010, M06476, M10869, etc.)  
• Fork-head (FOXA/C/D/F) and SOX family motifs  
• TEAD/MEF2/SRF and general bHLH neuronal motifs (NeuroD/ATOH/OLIG)  
• GATA and CXXC/KDM2 (CpG-rich promoter) motifs  
Motifs that score negatively include several stress- or cell-cycle-oriented factors (ATF/Jun, E2F), which is consistent with these regions functioning mainly as developmental rather than proliferative enhancers.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, the data point to a set of promoter-proximal and early-opening enhancer elements that:
• are already accessible in neuromesodermal progenitors,  
• stay accessible as cells diversify into neural, mesodermal and endodermal derivatives, and  
• provide a permissive chromatin scaffold onto which lineage-specific factors (SOX, FOX, HOX, nuclear receptors, etc.) are later recruited.

Thus this cluster represents a broad, multi-lineage “developmental programme” of the zebrafish embryo that integrates retinoic-acid signalling (RAR/RXR), Fork-head/SOX patterning cues and HOX positional information, remaining open from the tail-bud through at least the 30-somite stage.

## Cluster 13

[*assistant*:
Short summary of the only peak-cluster visible in the tables  

1. Where (pseudo-bulk signal)  
• Chromatin accessibility is highest in the optic cup at the 0-somite stage (≈ 298; all other tissues are ≈ 10-17).  
• Accessibility remains above background in other neural derivatives (telencephalon, hind-/mid-brain, spinal cord, floor plate, differentiating neurons) but never reaches the optic-cup level.  
• Mesodermal / endodermal samples and extra-embryonic lineages show only baseline signal (~11-13).  
→ The peak-set therefore marks a regulatory programme that is sharply activated in the presumptive eye field / early optic vesicle and is only modestly reused elsewhere in the embryo.

2. What genes lie under the peaks (truncated list)  
The gene catalogue is dominated by classical eye-field / early retina regulators and their downstream effectors, e.g.  
rx1/2/3, rax (rxrg), vsx1/2, pax6a/6b/2a/2b/5, otx1/2/5, vax1/2, six3/6/7/9, hmx1/2/3/4, barhl1/2, lhx1/2/4/9, crx, tbx2/3/5, meis1/2/3, pbx1-4, sp8/9, foxg1, shox2, sox2/5/9, irx1/3/5/7, dllx / eve / msx family members, etc.  
Many structural / signalling genes typical of nascent retinal neuroepithelium (e.g. flt1, lrp2, fgf8a, wnt1, nech1-4) are also present.  
→ Genic content reinforces the conclusion that these peaks belong to the eye-field / anterior neural plate‐retina lineage.

3. Which transcription-factor motifs are enriched  
Motif over-representation mirrors the gene list:  
• Eye-field homeobox factors: RAX/RX, OTX, PAX, VAX, VSX, BARHL, LHX, CRX, MEIS/PBX, SIX/EYA, TBX, IRX, HMX.  
• Generic neuro-ectoderm factors: SOX, FOX, CTCF, TEAD, NF-I, ZIC, KLF.  
• Nuclear-receptor motifs (RAR, RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR) – consistent with retinoic-acid signalling that patterns the early eye.  
• MEF2/SRF, E2F and CREB family motifs appear but with comparatively lower scores, suggesting more general cell-cycle or activity-dependent elements.  
→ The motif spectrum is exactly what is expected for enhancers active during specification/morphogenesis of the optic vesicle.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, the accessibility profile, gene content and motif landscape point to a single coherent peak-cluster that represents enhancers used by the zebrafish eye-field / early optic vesicle at ~10–13 hpf (0-somite), with decreasing activity as the embryo progresses to the 30-somite stage.  The same elements can be weakly active in other anterior neural tissues, explaining the moderate signal in telencephalon, hind-/mid-brain and spinal cord samples.

In short: this cluster captures the cis-regulatory programme that drives the earliest steps of retinal specification and optic-cup morphogenesis in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 14

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a set of regulatory elements that are largely silent in very early axial progenitors (neuro-mesodermal progenitors and presomitic mesoderm: log2 CPM ≃ 4–6), but that become progressively more accessible as development proceeds through somitogenesis and the major organ primordia differentiate.

1. Tissues in which the peaks are most accessible  
   • Endoderm-derived tissues – generic endoderm (highest value: 24 log2 CPM at 30-somite stage) and endocrine pancreas (≥ 15 log2 CPM at the 30-somite stage).  
   • Trunk mesoderm – forming somites and fast muscle (≥ 17 log2 CPM at 10–20 somites).  
   • Vascular / blood progenitors – hemangioblast and haematopoietic vasculature pseudobulks (8–16 log2 CPM).  
   • Heart myocardium, tail-bud and several neuronal subsets show intermediate accessibility.

   →  Overall, the cluster is characteristic of enhancers that “switch on” as multipotent axial progenitors give rise to trunk mesoderm, definitive endoderm and their organ derivatives during late somitogenesis.

2. Gene content  
   The ~3 800 genes linked to the peaks are heavily enriched for hallmark regulators of trunk patterning and organogenesis, including:  
   • Regional identity / patterning genes: almost complete HOX inventory, PAX (pax1/2/3/7/8), IRX, DLX, LBX, GBX, UNCX, barx, etc.  
   • Lineage-defining TFs for the relevant tissues – e.g. gata4/5/6, pdx1, onecut1/2/3, hnf1/4 family (endoderm/pancreas); mef2, myod, myog, myf5/6 (somite / muscle); tbx5/20, hand2 (heart); runx1/3, tal1/2 (blood); foxa/c/d/f and sox family members.  
   • Large numbers of extracellular-matrix, cell-adhesion and signalling genes (fn1, col*, itga/itgb, fgf/fgfr, wnt, bmp, vegf, etc.), consistent with active tissue morphogenesis.

3. Motif enrichment  
   The same developmental logic is reflected in the motif profile.  Motifs with the strongest positive enrichment (Z-score > ≈2) correspond to:  
   • HOX / PBX / MEIS homeodomain factors – axial patterning.  
   • FOX and SOX family motifs – endoderm, neural-crest and mesoderm competence factors.  
   • GATA, TBX and NKX motifs – cardiac and endodermal specification.  
   • MEF2 / SRF motifs – myogenic differentiation.  
   • Nuclear-receptor half-sites (RAR, RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR) – retinoic-acid and metabolic signalling typical of trunk development.  
   • RUNX, E-box (bHLH), TEAD and E2F sites – consistent with proliferating, differentiating mesoderm.

   The accompanying TF-gene table confirms that nearly all of the factors matching these motifs are themselves present in the linked-gene list, indicating extensive autoregulatory and cross-regulatory wiring.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   Taken together, the expression pattern, gene content and motif landscape point to Peak-cluster 0 being a broad enhancer class that is activated once cells leave the tail-bud progenitor state and embark on lineage-specific programmes that build the trunk:  
   – It gates the transition from multipotent axial progenitors to definitive endoderm (gut/pancreas/liver), paraxial mesoderm (somites → muscle, skeleton), lateral-plate mesoderm (heart, vasculature) and associated neuronal lineages.  
   – The diversity of motifs implies that the same physical peaks are used combinatorially in different tissues, explaining the moderately high accessibility in several, seemingly disparate, pseudobulks.

In short, cluster 0 captures a large cadre of late-somitogenesis enhancers that coordinate trunk patterning and the emergence of major mesodermal and endodermal organs in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 15

[*assistant*:
• Coverage of the individual peaks  
 The pseudobulk signal that defines the first peak-cluster is detectable in almost every lineage we profiled (neuro-mesodermal progenitors, paraxial mesoderm, neural plate/tube, endoderm, etc.; values hover around 4 on the log-scale).  
 Two lineages stand out: fast/slow muscle and 30-somite trunk muscle reach much higher accessibility (log-signal ≈ 5, one muscle sample spikes to ≈ 48), indicating that this cluster contains a large set of myogenic enhancers that switch from a “poised/open” state in progenitors to a “fully active” state once myofibres differentiate.

• Genes that lie under the peaks  
 The associated gene list (≈ 10 000 entries) is strongly enriched for:  
  – Structural and contractile muscle genes (ACTC1, TNNC2, MYH/MYL family, MYOG, MYOD, MYF5).  
  – ECM / adhesion components (many collagens, FN1, TNC, VCAN, integrins).  
  – Major developmental transcription-factor families: HOX, SOX, FOX, PAX, NKX, DLX, IRX, SIX, MEF2, TBX, RUNX, GATA, ETS, bHLH (ATOH/NEUROD/OLIG), nuclear receptors (RAR, RXR, NR2F, ROR, PPARS), etc.  
  – Signalling modules that pattern the early embryo (FGF, WNT, BMP, TGF-β/SMAD, RA-pathway enzymes, NOTCH ligands).  
 This composition is typical of broad “developmental enhancer” clusters that sit near key regulators rather than housekeeping loci.

• Motif signature of the peak-cluster (row 0 of the motif matrix)  
 Positive enrichments (z > 0) map almost exclusively to motifs bound by developmental TFs that drive mesoderm and neural differentiation – e.g.  
  SOX family (M02705), HOX/PBX (M02708, M07988), FOX (M04399), MEF2/TBX/TEAD, GATA, RUNX and ETS.  
 Negative scores are seen for E2F, KLF and other promoter-centred motifs that dominate cycling cells, consistent with the “differentiation vs. proliferation” switch.

• How this fits with the rest of the dataset  
 Although only the first cluster is shown in full, the accompanying TF-to-motif catalogue (115 motif groups) reveals that the other peak-clusters are built around the major embryonic transcriptional modules you would expect in a zebrafish trunk-stage atlas:  
  - SOX-centric clusters (rows 1 & 35) mark pluripotent/neuro-ectodermal enhancers.  
  - FOX-heavy clusters (rows 2, 56, 107) correspond to endoderm, floor-plate and ciliary-fox programmes.  
  - HOX/PBX/NKX blocks (rows 3, 4, 5, 70, 72) trace axial patterning and visceral organ mesoderm.  
  - MEF2/MYOD/PAX3/7 motifs (rows 10, 41, 42, 62, 96) are diagnostic for differentiating paraxial mesoderm and skeletal muscle.  
  - GATA/ONECUT clusters (rows 18, 52, 108) flag cardiac and gut endoderm enhancers.  
  - ETS/RUNX/RFX clusters (rows 49, 58, 93) highlight endothelial–blood and ciliary gene regulation.  
  - KLF/EGR/CTCF clusters (rows 65, 86, 87, 97) represent generic, chromatin-architecture or stress-response elements.  
 Taken together, the 115 peak-clusters partition the accessible genome into the canonical regulatory programmes that drive vertebrate trunk formation: pluripotency/neurulation, mesoderm segmentation, myogenesis, endoderm organogenesis and later tissue-specific maturation.

In short, the peak-cluster illustrated here is a prototypical “developmental super-enhancer” cohort that is already open in multipotent progenitors but culminates in maximal activity in maturing skeletal muscle; across the full data-set, similar motif-based clusters neatly recapitulate every major lineage-specific transcriptional network operating during the zebrafish 0- to 30-somite window.

## Cluster 16

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a set of regulatory elements that stay open in many tissues during zebrafish somitogenesis but are most active in the neuroectoderm.

1. Accessibility profile  
   • Pseudobulk accessibility is high (≈ 6–7 log₂ counts) in neural plate/early brain, spinal cord, hindbrain and tail-bud neural tissue from the 0- to 30-somite stage.  
   • Accessibility is moderate in neuromesodermal progenitors, presomitic/somitic mesoderm and lateral-plate mesoderm, and markedly lower in epidermis, floor-plate and mature muscle/heart, pointing to a neural bias rather than a truly ubiquitous profile.

2. Linked genes  
   The peak set is associated with >1000 genes. Besides many housekeeping loci (e.g. ubb, rpl/rps, aars1) it is enriched for neural transcription factors and signalling genes that pattern and differentiate the CNS: sox2/3/19, foxg1, pax6/7, zic1-5, irx1-7, dlx/gsx/evx, lmx1, uncx, neurod, mef2, runx, tcf/lef, as well as axon-guidance/ synaptic genes (grik2/3, kirrel3, nrxn2/3, slc17a7/8).

3. Motif enrichment  
   Motifs over-represented in the peaks mirror the gene list:  
   • Neural lineage TFs – SOX, FOX, PAX, ZIC, IRX, DLX/HOX, MEIS/PBX, ONECUT, NEUROD/ATOH, MEF2.  
   • Proliferation / basal promoter factors – E2F1-8, NF-Y, SP/KLF, CXXC1/KDM2B, YY1, CTCF.  
   • Nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, PPAR, ESR) and general bZIP/CREB–ATF/JUN, ETS and RUNX sites, consistent with widespread but developmentally modulated activity.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • The cluster likely contains a mixture of CpG-rich promoters and proximal enhancers that constitute the “core regulatory toolkit” of early neural progenitors.  
   • High accessibility in neuromesodermal cells and presomitic mesoderm suggests that many of these elements are already open before overt neural differentiation, fitting with a primed neurogenic state.  
   • Progressive attenuation after the 20–30-somite stage echoes the transition from proliferative neural plate to more lineage-restricted neural tissues.

In short, peak-cluster 0 captures broadly accessible promoters/enhancers that are most heavily used during early neurogenesis, integrating ubiquitous transcriptional machinery with neural-specific transcription factor binding to drive the initial specification, regionalisation and proliferation of the zebrafish nervous system.
]

## Cluster 17

[*assistant*:
Summary of peak-cluster 0  

1. Accessibility pattern  
• Peaks are highly open in the earliest samples (0–10-somite neuromesodermal progenitors, posterior PSM, early neural/endodermal populations; signal ≈ 5.5–6.5).  
• Accessibility steadily drops as development proceeds; by 20–30 somites the same peaks are much less accessible in most tissues (many values ≤ 1) and are essentially shut in epidermis, tail-bud and several terminal derivatives.  
→ This profile is typical of a genome-wide “early embryonic/open‐chromatin” module that is switched off once cells commit to specific fates.

2. Gene content  
The peak set is linked to several thousand genes, covering:  
• Generic cellular/house-keeping functions (e.g. ribosomal, metabolic, DNA-repair, chromatin-remodelling genes).  
• Numerous early patterning regulators (large blocks of Sox, Fox, Hox, Pax, Tbx, E2f, Klf, Runx, etc.).  
Because the list is broad and not lineage restricted, the cluster likely represents regulatory regions that keep much of the genome primed at the pluripotent / axial-progenitor stage.

3. Motif enrichment  
Positive Z-scores point to a strong enrichment for pioneer and early patterning TF motifs:  
• Sox/POU family (M03731, M06063)  
• Forkhead (FOXA/FOXC/FOXF)  
• CTCF-like and early enhancer organisers.  
Negative Z-scores (e.g. for Mef2, NeuroD, Gata, Runx motifs) indicate depletion of motifs that become important later in muscle, neuronal or blood lineages.  
→ The motif landscape reinforces the view that these peaks are bound by pioneer factors that keep chromatin open before lineage-specific factors take over.

4. Biological interpretation  
Cluster 0 therefore captures an “early-open / multipotent” chromatin state.  
It is:  
• Most accessible in axial progenitors immediately after gastrulation.  
• Characterised by pioneer-factor binding sites and associated with a broad, largely un-restricted gene set.  
• Progressively shut down as differentiation proceeds, when lineage-specific clusters (not shown here) with muscle, neural, endoderm, etc. motifs and genes become dominant.

In short, peak-cluster 0 marks the genome-wide, pioneer-factor-driven open chromatin landscape of early zebrafish trunk progenitors, which is subsequently closed during somitogenesis and lineage commitment.
]

## Cluster 18

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 describes a set of regulatory regions that are:

1. Most accessible in early lateral–plate/ cardiopharyngeal mesoderm  
   • The heart-myocardium pseudobulks show the highest signal (≈45–53 a.u. at 0–15 som).  
   • Accessibility drops steadily after 20 som and is almost basal by 30 som.  
   • Moderate signal is also seen in contemporaneous somites and in endoderm-derived endocrine pancreas, pointing to a shared mesoderm–endoderm programme during the first 24 h of development.

2. Linked to a gene repertoire typical of early heart, splanchnic mesoderm and pharyngeal–arch mesenchyme  
   – contractile/mesenchymal genes: acta2, actn1/4, myh11b, col1/5/8, lama2, fn1b, tnc  
   – signalling–receptor genes: fgfr3, vegfa, wnt2/2ba, gata4/5/6, tgfb2, bmp16, foxc1/2, nkx2.5 surrogates (nkx2-family appears in the motif list)  
   – cardiac/branchial arch TFs: tbx5b, tcf21, hand2, meis1/2/3, hox a/b/c clusters, dlx, lbx, lmx, sp8/9, prrx1, alx family, isl1/2, gata factors, runx1/3.

3. Motif enrichment highlights the same developmental drivers  
   • Strong positive Z-scores for homeobox families (HOX, DLX, MSX, LHX, BARX, ALX), Fork-head factors (FOX, FOXC/F), T-box (TBX), MEF2, GATA and bHLH (HAND/TCF21, NEUROG) motifs.  
   • These motifs mesh with the gene list and with the expression pattern of the cluster, reinforcing a role in heart, pharyngeal-arch and lateral-plate mesoderm specification.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   The cluster most likely represents enhancers that are switched on as soon as lateral-plate mesoderm is specified and that remain active through cardiac-field formation, early myocardium differentiation and, to a lesser extent, in related mesenchymal derivatives (somite border cells, pharyngeal mesenchyme, pancreatic mesoderm/ endoderm interface). Their activity diminishes once the heart tube starts beating (≈24 hpf / ≥30 som), consistent with a hand-off to more mature, muscle-specific enhancer sets.

In brief, peak-cluster 0 captures the early cardiopharyngeal mesoderm enhancer landscape: it is highly heart-biased, transient, and driven by a combined Homeobox, Fork-head, T-box, GATA and MEF2 transcription-factor grammar.
]

## Cluster 19

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a set of regulatory regions that are open in almost every lineage at the 0- to 20-somite stages and that lose accessibility once embryos reach the 30-somite stage.  The pseudobulk profile is “flat-high”: chromatin accessibility is uniformly high (≈ log2 CPM 4–5) in neuromesodermal progenitors, paraxial mesoderm, early neural, endodermal and neural-crest lineages, but drops sharply (≤ 1 log2 unit) by 30 somites and is almost absent in late-maturing tissues such as fast muscle or hatching-gland.  Thus the cluster most likely marks a genome-wide “early embryo” chromatin programme that is switched off as cells commit to specific fates.

Associated genes are extremely numerous and functionally heterogeneous: they include (i) core metabolic and housekeeping loci (e.g. Ubb, Rpl/Rps families, Hspa/Hsp90, Atpases), (ii) many developmentally important transcription factors and signalling components (Hox, Sox, Fox, Pbx/Meis, Pax, Nkx, Runx, Tbx, Gata, Ets, Nr, Mef2, Irx, Six, Dlx, Myrf, Osr, etc.) and (iii) regulators of chromatin state and RNA processing (Kdm, Setd, Kmt2, Ncor, Med, Brd, Ctcf, Cohesin, splicing factors).  In other words, these peaks sit near a “tool-box” of genes required by virtually all early progenitors before lineage-restricted programmes take over.

Motif enrichment mirrors this broad spectrum.  The strongest positive z-scores belong to:
• Sox / HMG family motifs (Sox2/3/19/21, SoxB1)  
• Forkhead motifs (FoxA/C/D/F/K)  
• Homeobox motifs (Pbx/Meis, Hox, Lhx, Dlx, Uncx, Barhl)  
• Early pioneer / opening factors (Klf, Gata, NF-Y, Ctcf)  
• Ets, Runx, Mef2, bHLH (NeuroD/Ascl/Hand/Twist), and nuclear-receptor (Rara/Rxra/Esr/PPAR) sites.

Taken together, peak-cluster 0 can be viewed as the shared, pluripotent/progenitor chromatin landscape of the early zebrafish trunk.  It is characterised by ubiquitous accessibility, a gene set rich in generic developmental regulators, and a motif catalogue that combines pioneer factors with the main lineage-priming transcription-factor families.  Its coordinated closure by the 30-somite stage coincides with the transition from broadly multipotent progenitors to lineage-restricted, tissue-specific chromatin states.
]

## Cluster 20

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 corresponds to a very broadly accessible set of regulatory elements.

1. Chromatin accessibility profile  
   • Most tissues and stages show a comparable accessibility signal (log-counts ≈ 4.5–5.5).  
   • Three striking outliers reveal lineage-biased hyper-accessibility:  
     – Heart myocardium at the 0-somite stage (log 64) – an early cardiogenic burst.  
     – Optic / eye-field cells at 0- and 10-somites (log 14–15).  
     – A smaller spike in fast muscle at 30-somites (log 6).  
   Thus the peaks stay open in virtually every lineage but are maximally used in nascent heart and optic tissues.

2. Nearby genes (~4,000)  
   The peak set is heavily enriched for developmental regulators and signalling genes: Hox, Fox, Sox, Pax, Nkx, Irx, Lhx, Dlx, Tbx, Gata, Meis/Pbx, Runx, Mef2, Mefc, nuclear receptors (Rara, Rxr, Ppara/γ, Ror), AP-1 family, E-box/Prdm and many chromatin modifiers (Kdm, Arid, Ctcf).  In other words, it captures the promoter / first-intron regions of “tool-kit” genes that pattern all three germ layers.

3. Motif enrichment  
   The same developmental signatures recur at the motif level.  Highly over-represented motifs belong to:  
   • Forkhead (FOX)  
   • SOX (pluripotency & neural crest)  
   • Homeobox subclasses – Hox, PAX, NKX, DLX, IRX, LHX, VSX, BARHL, etc.  
   • Nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR, PPAR, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR)  
   • T-box (TBX), MEF2, RUNX, TEAD, GATA  
   • E2F cell-cycle drivers and CTCF/YY1 architectural sites  
   • AP-1 / ATF / CREB stress–response factors.

4. Motif-to-factor map  
   The mapping table confirms that the motifs attract large Sox and Fox families (direct and indirect), Kdm2ba/Cxxc1 chromatin readers, E-box (bHLH) regulators of neurogenesis and myogenesis, as well as general NR, AP-1 and IRF immune/stress factors.

5. Functional interpretation  
   • These peaks are essentially a “core promoter / first-enhancer” collection for master regulators of body-plan formation.  
   • They remain constitutively open to keep developmental genes poised in most cell types, but they are preferentially exploited when specific lineages (heart, optic, muscle) initiate rapid transcriptional programmes.  
   • The dominant TF grammar (Forkhead + Sox + Homeobox + NR) is exactly what is expected for early zebrafish axis patterning, organ rudiment specification and maintenance of developmental competence.

In short, peak-cluster 0 represents a ubiquitous yet lineage-primable regulatory compartment for key developmental regulators; it is particularly activated in the earliest cardiomyocyte and eye-field precursors and is choreographed by a classic combination of FOX, SOX, HOX/PAX/NKX and nuclear-receptor transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 21

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 is characterised by a very mesoderm-centred chromatin profile.  
1. Pseudobulk accessibility/expression  
• Highest signals are seen in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and newly formed somites (values ≈45-70).  
• Accessibility stays high in tail-bud and muscle samples and, to a lesser extent, in notochord and heart.  
• Most ectodermal, endodermal or neural derivatives (epidermis, endocrine pancreas, differentiating neurons, optic cup, floor-plate etc.) show low values (<20).  
⇒ The peaks therefore mark regulatory elements that are active along the NMP → PSM → somite/muscle trajectory during the 0- to 30-somite window.

2. Gene content (selected examples from the long list)  
• Axial progenitor / segmentation genes: tbxta, tbx6, tbx16, msgn1, mespa/b, ripply1/2, her7, dkk1b, wnt3a/8a, fgf8a.  
• Paraxial patterning: an extensive spectrum of hoxa, hoxb, hoxc and hoxd genes plus co-factors meis, pbx, pknox.  
• Early myogenesis: myod1, myf5, myog, mef2 family members, acta1a, myl1, tnni2, tpm2, csrp3.  
• ECM / migration: fn1a/b, col1/3/5/8/11, lama/lamc genes, itga5, itga8, loxl.  
These genes fit the transcriptional programme of paraxial mesoderm that is gearing up for segmentation and skeletal-muscle differentiation.

3. Motif enrichment  
The peak set is enriched for motifs recognised by  
• T-box (T/Brachyury, TBX6/16) – axial progenitor identity  
• Hox / Pbx-Meis – rostro-caudal patterning  
• Sox and Fox family factors – progenitor maintenance and mesodermal competence  
• Mef2 / MyoD / bHLH – myogenic differentiation  
• E2F, E-box and Runx/NF-Y – proliferative, early differentiation inputs  
Altogether the motif repertoire matches the transcription factors that drive segmentation, patterning and early muscle formation.

Summary  
Cluster 0 comprises regulatory elements that open specifically in trunk axial progenitors and remain active through presomitic mesoderm and early somite formation, priming cells for skeletal-muscle fate.  Its gene and motif signatures capture the core segmentation clock, Hox axial code and the first wave of myogenic regulators, indicating that this cluster underpins the embryonic programme that converts NMPs into paraxial mesoderm and nascent muscle during zebrafish somitogenesis.

## Cluster 22

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 0 represents a set of regulatory elements that becomes broadly accessible during zebrafish segmentation but is maximally open in the surface ectoderm/epidermis once embryos reach the ≥30-somite stage.  

1. Accessibility profile  
• Low-to-moderate accessibility (5–8 a.u.) is detected in most tissues at 0- to 20-somite stages.  
• A sharp, epidermis-restricted spike (~95 a.u.) is seen in “epidermis_30 somites”, with modest elevations in related surface ectoderm derivatives (hatching gland, optic cup, pharyngeal arches) and in late skeletal muscle/somite samples.  

2. Gene content  
The ~6 000 genes linked to this cluster are heavily enriched for:  
• Surface and extracellular‐matrix components (many collagens, laminins, fibronectin, integrins).  
• Cytoskeletal and adhesion regulators (actins, myosins, cadherins, catenins).  
• Signalling modulators typical of epidermal and mesenchymal tissues (Wnt, FGF, BMP, EGFR and MAP-kinase pathway members).  
Overall, the gene catalogue matches the transcriptional programme of differentiating epidermis and underlying mesenchyme.

3. Motif enrichment and candidate regulators  
The motif Z-score profile highlights several TF families:  
• AP-1 / ATF / Jun–Fos family (strong M08130, M06453 etc.) – consistent with stress- and differentiation-induced epidermal genes.  
• KLF/Sp and GRHL motifs – key drivers of epithelial barrier maturation.  
• Broad ectodermal regulators (SOX, FOX, PAX, DLX, MSX, LHX, HOX).  
• Nuclear receptor motifs (RAR/RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR) that often act during late epithelial patterning.  
• MEF2 and RUNX sites, explaining the moderate activity in late myotome/somite samples.

4. Biological interpretation  
Putting the three data layers together, cluster 0 marks a cohort of enhancers that:  
• Are progressively licensed during somitogenesis,  
• Reach peak usage in the epidermis as cells terminally differentiate,  
• Are likely driven by cooperative action of AP-1/KLF/GRHL with ectoderm-patterning SOX and FOX factors, and  
• Also remain accessible in neighbouring mesodermal tissues where MEF2 and RUNX factors contribute.

In short, peak cluster 0 captures the late-somite epidermal regulatory landscape, with secondary activity in muscle and craniofacial ectoderm, and is governed by a composite network of epithelial (AP-1, KLF, GRHL) and regional (SOX/FOX/HOX) transcription factors.

Summary of the peak-cluster catalogue

1. Global structure  
• The peaks fall into a limited number of chromatin-accessibility “modules”.  
• Each module is characterised by a coherent pseudobulk profile (columns), a recurrent set of nearby genes, and a distinctive collection of transcription-factor (TF) motifs.  
• Together, these features recapitulate the major transcriptional programmes that operate during zebrafish segmentation (0- to 30-somite stage).

2. Example – Cluster 0 (the one printed in full)  
• Accessibility pattern: signal is present in virtually every cell type and generally rises with developmental time, peaking at ∼30 somites (optic cup, floor plate, haematopoietic vasculature and endocrine pancreas show the largest increase).  
• Gene content: >1 000 genes, heavily enriched for “house-keeping” and cell-cycle regulators (E2F family, MCMs, KDM/SET methyl-transferases, EP300/CBP) but also many multi-lineage developmental TFs (large families of Sox, Fox, Hox, Tbx, Pax, Klf, nuclear receptors, etc.).  
• Motif landscape: the highest Z-scores belong to Sox, Fox, Hox/Pbx, E2F, MEF2, Nuclear-Receptor (RXR/RAR/NR2F) and CREB/ATF sites, as well as CXXC/KDM2 motifs that mark CpG–rich promoters.  
→ Interpretation: Cluster 0 represents a broadly accessible, promoter-biased module that supplies the generic transcriptional infrastructure required by most embryonic cells, while still harbouring binding sites for the master regulators that will later drive lineage-specific programmes.

3. Other recurrent modules (inferred from motif – TF dictionaries)  
Although only one cluster was displayed in detail, the full motif dictionary reveals additional, lineage-restricted modules:

• Neural/Pluripotent: SoxB1 (Sox2/3/19), Otx, Zic, Pax6 motifs – active in early neural plate and optic structures.  
• Neural-crest: SOX10/9 + TFAP2 + FoxD3 motifs – crest-specific peaks.  
• Muscle / Para-axial mesoderm: MyoD/Myf5/MEF2, Tcf/Lef and Wnt-responsive elements – peaks restricted to myogenic rows and somites.  
• Endoderm / Pancreas: FoxA, Gata, Pdx1 motifs – peaks that become accessible in gut tube, liver and endocrine pancreas.  
• Vascular / Blood: Etv2/Fli1/Runx/Tal1 sites – haemato-vascular progenitors.  
• Posterior body / NMP-tailbud: T (Brachyury), Cdx, Hox A/C and Sox2/Sox3 – marks neuromesodermal progenitor enhancers.  
• Floor-plate / Notochord: FoxA2, Noto, Shh-dependent Gli motifs.  
• Immune / Stress: IRF, NF-κB, AP-1 (Jun/Fos/Batf) clusters that spike in haematopoietic and inflammatory niches.  

4. Developmental perspective  
The progression from 0- to 30-somite stages is accompanied by a gradual shift from the ubiquitous/promoter-like cluster (high in cluster 0) towards increasingly tissue-restricted clusters whose motif signatures match the master regulators of each lineage. This mirrors the normal transition from multi-potent progenitors to committed embryonic tissues.

In short, the peak clusters segregate into (i) a ubiquitous, late-segmentation promoter module (exemplified by cluster 0) and (ii) multiple lineage-restricted enhancer modules driven by the canonical TFs that specify neural, mesodermal, endodermal, vascular and neural-crest fates in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 24

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a very large group of open chromatin elements that are already accessible in almost every germ-layer derivative at the 0–5 somite stages (pseudobulk signal ~3.4–4 on the log-scale) but become strikingly more accessible in the endocrine-pancreas sample by the 30-somite stage (value ≈ 45).  Apart from this late pancreatic “spike”, accessibility remains fairly uniform across posterior neural (tail-bud), NMP/PSM, endoderm and most mesodermal samples, indicating that this cluster marks a pan-embryonic, broadly permissive chromatin compartment that individual lineages can later reuse.

1.  Associated genes  
   • The peak set is linked to >9 000 genes, including canonical regulators of all three germ layers – e.g. Pdx1, Hnf4a/g, Gata4/6 (endoderm; pancreas & liver), Sox2/3/19 (neuroectoderm), Foxa/Foxd/Foxe families, Pax1/3/6/7, Dlx/Irx, Hox clusters, Tbx1/5, Nkx2-1/2-5, Runx1/3, Mef2, etc.  
   • Presence of many pancreas-specific (Pdx1, Hnf4, Gata, Maf, Neurod, Isl1/2) and heart-muscle (Tbx, Nkx, Mef2, Myf, Myh) genes explains the pronounced endocrine-pancreas accessibility burst and the generally moderate signal in cardiac and muscle samples.

2.  Motif enrichment  
   • Developmental pioneer factors: very strong Sox (Sox2/Sox3/Sox10/Sox17), Fox (FoxA/FoxC/FoxD/FoxG), Gata, and CTCF/CXXC motifs – consistent with open, competence-type enhancers.  
   • Regional identity factors: extensive Hox, Pax, Irx, Dlx, Nkx, Lhx and Tbx motif families mirror the gene list and suggest these peaks are reused by numerous positional programmes.  
   • Lineage-restricted motifs: Pdx1, Onecut, Hnf4, Mef2, Mnx/Isl and Runx sites highlight endocrine-pancreas, hepatic, muscle and haematopoietic potentials embedded in the same peak set.

3.  Functional interpretation  
   • Cluster 0 likely corresponds to a set of “multi-potent developmental enhancers”: elements that become accessible very early, stay open in most progenitors, and later serve as substrates for lineage-specific TF combinations.  
   • The dramatic endocrine-pancreas up-shift at the 30-somite stage suggests that a subset of these enhancers is selectively amplified or further opened when pancreatic endocrine cells differentiate – perhaps reflecting high Pdx1/Hnf4/Gata occupancy and active insulin-cell transcription.  
   • Because the same peaks harbour motifs for neural (Sox, Homeobox), mesodermal (Tbx, Mef2) and endodermal (FoxA, Gata, Pdx1) regulators, they provide a molecular explanation for how distinct zebrafish lineages can draw on a common “primed” enhancer repertoire while still achieving cell-type-specific output.

In short, peak-cluster 0 is a large, early-opening enhancer compartment that remains moderately accessible across the embryo but is most powerfully exploited by the endocrine-pancreas lineage as development proceeds.
]

## Cluster 25

[*assistant*:
Below is a concise “verbal snapshot” of what the first peak-cluster looks like when the three layers of information (chromatin accessibility, nearby genes, and motif enrichment) are viewed together.  
(Only the first cluster was included in the excerpt; if you have additional rows the same logic can be applied to each one.)

1. Cell-type / stage pattern of accessibility  
   • The peaks are already moderately open in early paraxial mesoderm (NMP and PSM at 0–5 somites) but their accessibility rises sharply in haemangioblasts and in the “haematopoietic/vasculature” pseudobulks, peaking between 15- and 30-somite stages (≈24–28 hpf).  
   • They are also conspicuously open in other endothelium-derived tissues (heart myocardium) and in endoderm-derived endocrine pancreas, but remain comparatively closed in most neuro-ectodermal, epidermal and muscle samples.  
   • Taken together, the chromatin profile points to an enhancer set that becomes progressively activated as mesoderm differentiates into haemogenic endothelium and early blood/vascular lineages.

2. Gene neighbourhood  
   • The gene list that co-localises with these peaks is heavily enriched for canonical endothelial / blood regulators (tal1 / scl, gata1/2, lmo2, runx1, fli1, etv2, erg, kdrl/kdr, tek, vegfc, flt1/4, vwf, vcam1, pecam1, dll4, jag1, notch1, sox7/17/18, prox1, lmo2, spi1/pu.1, cdh5, etc.).  
   • Cardiovascular and smooth-muscle genes (hand2, tcf21, nkx2-5, tnnt2, myh6/7, etc.) and a subset of endoderm/pancreas factors (gata4/5/6, hhex, pdx1) are present as well, matching the secondary accessibility in those tissues.  
   • GO/KEGG terms (if calculated) would cluster around “blood vessel morphogenesis”, “haematopoietic cell fate commitment”, “Notch signalling” and “response to VEGF”.

3. Motif landscape  
   • The most positively enriched Position-Weight Matrices correspond to ETS (Fli1/Erg/Etv2), GATA (Gata1/2/3/6), RUNX (Runx1/2/3), TAL/LMO, FOX, SOX and HOX families – exactly the TFs that drive haemangioblast, endothelial and early blood programmes.  
   • Additional strong signals for MEF2 and TBX motifs fit with the cardiac accessibility, while moderate HOX/PKNOX/PBX signatures are expected for anterior–posterior patterning of the vasculature.  
   • The combination of ETS + GATA + RUNX + TAL is a well-known “haemogenic endothelium” code, reinforcing the functional interpretation.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   • This peak set most likely represents an enhancer module that is first licensed in nascent mesoderm, then fully activated in haemangioblasts, arterial/venous endothelium and emergent haematopoietic stem-cell–producing endothelium, with partial reuse in heart and pancreatic lineages.  
   • Its temporal trajectory (0 → 30 somites) mirrors the transition from multipotent tail-bud mesoderm through endothelial specification to definitive blood and vascular tissues.

If you provide the remaining rows, one can map each cluster in the same way—cross-referencing its accessibility footprint, gene content and motif logic—to build a complete regulatory atlas of the zebrafish 10–30 somite embryo.
]

## Cluster 26

[*assistant*:
• Pseudo-bulk accessibility pattern  
  – Peak-cluster 0 is open in virtually every lineage we profiled (values mostly 80-110 in >130 different pseudobulk samples).  
  – Accessibility is slightly higher in neural derivatives (differentiating neurons, floor-plate, hind-/mid-brain, spinal cord, optic cup) and in paraxial mesoderm / muscle, and somewhat lower in surface ectoderm (epidermis) and late tail-bud, but the differences are modest.  
  – This global distribution suggests that the underlying peaks are constitutively accessible rather than lineage-restricted.

• Genes linked to the peaks  
  – >7 000 genes are associated; they span all three germ layers and include very many developmental regulators (sox, fox, hox, irx, nkx, pax, tbx, meis/pbx, gata, runx, e2f, myf/maf/mef2, etc.), core signalling components (fgf, wnt, bmp, notch, retinoid/nuclear-receptor genes) and general cellular/ metabolic genes.  
  – The breadth of the gene list echoes the broadly accessible chromatin profile.

• Motif enrichment  
  – The motif column shows modest but positive enrichments for pioneer or early embryonic TF families (SOX/FOX, Homeobox/Hox‐like, E2F, MEF2, TEAD, CREB/AP-1, GATA, nuclear receptors RAR/RXR/PPAR/ROR).  
  – No single tissue-specific motif dominates; instead many motifs score between +1 and +2 log-fold-change, consistent with multi-lineage potential.  
  – Motifs that score negatively (e.g. several AP-2/NKX motifs) indicate that a few lineage-restricted sites are *under-represented* in this cluster.

• Biological interpretation  
  – Peak-cluster 0 most likely represents a set of “house-keeping / primed” promoters and early developmental enhancers that remain open throughout segmentation-stage zebrafish embryos.  
  – These elements are poised to recruit diverse lineage-determining factors later, rather than marking one particular fate at the 0–30-somite stages examined.
]

## Cluster 27

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a very “promoter-like / housekeeping” class of regulatory elements.

1. Accessibility profile  
   • In every pseudobulk profile ( > 120 embryonic lineages × six time points) the signal sits at 4–5 log-units, i.e. it is constitutively open.  
   • Only two clear outliers are seen: optic-cup at 0 s (≈38) and fast/late muscle at 30 s (≈49).  These probably reflect exceptionally large read depth or very strong transcription of a few highly expressed genes rather than a lineage-restricted pattern; the cluster never “switches off” anywhere else.

2. Associated genes  
   • > 2 500 genes are linked; they span virtually all functional categories (metabolism, signalling, structural, chromatin, cell cycle, etc.) and include many broadly expressed genes (e.g. kdm2, cxxc family, e2f targets, cytoskeletal and membrane proteins).  
   • There is no obvious enrichment for a single developmental lineage, again consistent with a general-purpose promoter set.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • Positive Z-scores are strongest for GC-rich promoter motifs (M04731 – Sp/KLF-type, M04785 – GC-box, M06063 – CXXC/KDM2B, M04157/03591 – CREB/ATF) and for cell-cycle regulators (E2F series).  
   • Classic lineage-defining motifs (HOX, SOX, FOX, PAX, GATA, NKX, MEF2, etc.) are neutral or depleted (negative Z-scores), indicating that the peaks are not enhancer elements specialised for any one tissue.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster-0 peaks are best interpreted as core promoters or proximal regulatory regions that remain accessible in virtually all embryonic cells from tail-bud through 30-somite stages.  
   • Their activity provides the basal transcriptional infrastructure upon which lineage-specific enhancer clusters (not shown here) will act.

In short, peak-cluster 0 is a constitutively open, promoter-dominated set of chromatin regions that supports housekeeping gene expression across the developing zebrafish embryo rather than driving lineage-specific programs.
]

## Cluster 28

[*assistant*:
Below is a concise “bird-eye” view of what the peak-calling / pseudobulk matrix is telling us.

1. How many biologically distinct clusters are present?  
   • Each peak cluster shows a clearly different accessibility profile along the cell-type × developmental-time matrix (0–30 somites).  
   • On inspection of the first few clusters (row 0 shown, others not printed) three broad behaviours are evident:  
     a) Early “core axial progenitor” clusters – open in NMPs and/or presomitic mesoderm at 0- to 10-somite stages, then rapidly close.  
     b) Progressive “neurogenic” clusters – gradually gain accessibility, peaking in differentiating neurones, spinal cord, hind-/mid-brain, neural crest or enteric neurones at ≥15 somites.  
     c) Germ-layer/organ-restricted clusters – e.g. Gata/Hnf4–positive endoderm, Tbx/Mef2-rich cardiac & myogenic mesoderm, Grhl/Klf-rich surface ectoderm, etc.

2. Example: the printed cluster 0 – a pan-neurogenic module  
   • Accessibility starts modestly in NMP/PSM (≈5 RPKM) but rises strongly in differentiating neurones and especially enteric neurones (up to 70 a.u. at 30 somites).  
   • Associated gene list is strongly enriched for neuronal and axon-guidance genes (sox, fox, pax, neurod, nlgn, gria/b, cacna, robo/slit, etc.).  
   • Motif enrichment is dominated by SOX, FOX/FOXP, bHLH (NeuroD/Ascl), Homeobox (Pax, Hox, Dlx, Lhx), MEF2 and nuclear-receptor (RAR/RXR) families. These TFs are precisely those active during zebrafish neurogenesis and rostro-caudal patterning.  
   • Taken together, cluster 0 represents regulatory elements that progressively open as multipotent progenitors commit to neuronal lineages and then remain highly accessible in late differentiating neurones (including the enteric nervous system).

3. Motif→factor table validates the lineage assignments  
   • Early axial clusters are enriched for T/BRACHYURY, Cdx, TCF/LEF and E2F motifs – hallmark of cycling trunk progenitors.  
   • Mesoderm / myotome clusters carry Tbx, Mef2, MyoD/Myf and Runx motifs.  
   • Endoderm-biased clusters show strong Gata4/5/6, FoxA and Hnf4 signatures.  
   • Surface ectoderm/epidermis peaks are loaded with Grhl, Klf4/6/17 and Tfap2 motifs.  
   • Neural crest peaks add Sox10/9-, Mitf- and Tfap2-related sites.  

4. Developmental logic that emerges  
   • Peaks open first in multipotent progenitors (NMPs) with generic proliferation/axis-pattern motifs.  
   • As cells exit the progenitor pool, lineage-specific TFs (Sox-, Pax-, Tbx-, Gata-families) bind, creating the second wave of accessibility.  
   • Finally, terminal differentiation factors (NeuroD, MEF2, Myogenin, Mitf, etc.) sharpen the chromatin landscape in fully specified tissues.

5. Take-home message  
   The peak clusters collectively trace the classical zebrafish trunk gastrula-to-organogenesis trajectory: from neuromesodermal progenitors through mesodermal segmentation and neurogenesis to mature tissue programmes.  Motif content, linked genes and their temporal accessibility patterns are internally consistent and match known transcriptional regulators of each lineage.
]

## Cluster 29

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 represents a late, posterior axial chromatin programme.

1. Cell-type / stage specificity  
   • Very strong accessibility in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) at the 30-somite stage (64 a.u.) and in tail-bud tissue at the same stage (≈71 a.u.).  
   • All other NMP stages, the mature presomitic mesoderm (PSM), somites, notochord and most neural derivatives show only basal accessibility (≈4-6 a.u.).  
   • Hence the peaks become maximally accessible only when the posterior body axis has fully elongated.

2. Gene content  
   • The peak set is extraordinarily gene-rich (≈10 000 genes).  Many belong to posterior patterning and trunk / tail morphogenesis pathways:  
     – HOX A/B/C/D clusters (e.g. hoxb1-10, hoxa9-13, hoxc9-13).  
     – Wnt, Fgf and retinoid signalling regulators (wnt3, wnt5b, fgf10/18, rarga, rxr genes).  
     – Neuromesodermal identity genes (msgn1, tbx6, tbxta, cdx1/4, sall4).  
     – Axial mesoderm / somite structural genes (col11a2, col12a1, matn, fras/frem, lama/lamb/lamc).  
   • The large tail-bud signature is consistent with global chromatin de-condensation observed in rapidly proliferating posterior progenitors.

3. Motif landscape  
   • Over-represented motifs correspond to transcription-factor families that control posterior axial identity:  
     – CDX / HOX and PBX/MEIS cofactors (motifs M03731, M04174, M03528, etc.).  
     – FOX (FoxA/C/D/F) and SOX (Sox2/3/19, etc.) motifs, matching the dual neuro-mesodermal fate of NMPs.  
     – T-box (TBX2/6/16), TEAD and E2F motifs, reflecting high proliferative activity.  
     – Nuclear-receptor motifs for RA and steroid/thyroid receptors (RAR-RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF).  

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster 0 marks enhancers that switch on specifically in the posterior growth zone once somitogenesis is advanced.  
   • The motif and gene composition implies coordinated input of CDX/HOX, FOX/SOX and nuclear-receptor factors to maintain bipotent NMPs while patterning emerging somites and tail tissues.  
   • The strong tail-bud signal but low activity elsewhere suggests these enhancers shut down as cells exit the tail-bud and differentiate.

In brief, peak-cluster 0 defines a posterior-tail chromatin state driven by HOX/CDX, FOX/SOX and nuclear-receptor transcription factors, peaking in highly proliferative NMPs and tail-bud cells at the end of axial elongation.
]

## Cluster 30

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 behaves like a broadly “neuronal” regulatory module that only becomes strongly and selectively open in late–stage enteric–neuron derivatives.

1. Accessibility profile  
• Most tissues and stages sit at a low-to-moderate accessibility plateau (∼3 units).  
• A sharp spike (31.2 units) is seen in enteric-neurons at the 30-somite stage, with smaller late up-swings in other neuronal sub-types (differentiating neurones, spinal cord, hind-/mid-brain) and tail-bud.  
• Mesodermal and endodermal compartments remain at the baseline, indicating the peak set is essentially neuro-ectoderm specific and becomes maximally active during the final wave of neural-crest/enteric maturation.

2. Genes linked to the peaks  
The associated gene list is huge (>2 000), but the functional makeup is coherent:  
• Axon guidance / synapse formation – nrxn1/2/3, cntn3-5, robo1, lrrtm4, shank2, dlg4, snap25, syt1/3/6/7, rims1/3, nrxn3, grm7, gria2/3, grin2 sub-units, kcn, cacna and scn channel families.  
• Neural-crest / enteric-specific regulators – sox10, phox2a/b, retinoic-acid–responsive hox genes, meis/pbx cofactors, hand2, gfra receptors.  
• Activity-dependent transcription factors – npas3, rora/b/c, foxp1/4, bdnf‐associated mef2 family members.  
• General neuronal metabolism / cytoskeleton – map2k, myo, ank, spectrin family, cytoskeletal adaptors (caprin, dock, arp2/3).

Altogether the list matches mature, circuitry-forming neurons rather than progenitors.

3. Motif enrichment  
Z-scores highlight several classes of TF motifs:  
• Pan-neuronal lineage factors: SOX (sox2/3/5/10/14/19), FOX (foxa/f/d/g/i/j), POU/OTX, NEUROD/ATOH bHLH, ZIC, IRX and PAX.  
• Patterning / positional cues: large block of HOX-PBX-MEIS motifs, plus UNC-homeobox and LIM-homeobox (LHX, ISL).  
• Activity-dependent and maturation-linked motifs: MEF2, CREB/ATF, AP-1 (FOS/JUN, BATF), nuclear receptors of the RAR/RXR and NR2F (COUP-TF) families.  
• Cell-cycle exit / terminal differentiation signatures: E2F, KDM2/CXXC, REST and NR4A immediate early factors.

4. Biological interpretation  
The accessibility kinetics, gene content and motif landscape are all typical of enhancers that:  
• Turn on once neural-crest-derived neurons leave the cell cycle and start wiring (≈25–30 somites).  
• Integrate axial-patterning inputs (RA/HOX, COUP-TF, PBX/MEIS) with pan-neuronal TFs (SOX/FOX/ZIC) and activity-driven signals (MEF2, CREB, AP-1).  
• Control large batteries of genes needed for axon extension, synaptogenesis and neurotransmission.

Hence cluster-0 likely contains the “late maturation / connectivity” enhancer set for enteric (and more broadly hind-brain/spinal) neurons, explaining its sharp late-stage, neuron-restricted accessibility peak.
]

## Cluster 31

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 most likely represents the chromatin programme that is switched on late in trunk formation, when the posterior body and mature somites are being built.

1. Cell types / stages in which the peaks are most accessible  
   • Highest pseudobulk signal is seen in 30-somite tissues that derive from posterior paraxial mesoderm: “somites_30 s” (≈68 a.u.), “NMPs_30 s” (≈56), and early tail-bud (0 s, ≈28; 5–20 s, 6–7).  
   • Accessibility is only basal (≈5–6) in earlier NMP, PSM or neural samples and in most endoderm-/ectoderm-derived lineages.  
   • This pattern implies that the cluster marks enhancers that open progressively along the A–P axis and peak once somites are fully epithelialised and beginning myogenic differentiation.

2. Gene content (nearby genes)  
   ∙ Very large gene set (>3 000) enriched for:  
     – Patterning TFs: full HOX A/B/C/D series, NKX, LHX, DLX, PBX/MEIS, PAX, TBX, SIX, IRX, FOX and SOX families.  
     – Myogenic / mesodermal effectors: myh7bb, myf5/myod1, actc1c, mef2a/b/c/d, unc45b, csrp3, etc.  
     – ECM / adhesion and segmentation genes: multiple collagen (col11a2, col12a1, col1a2), semaphorins, cadherins, plxns, rspo2, fgf18, bmp6/7b, wnt‐related modulators.  
   ∙ This constellation of genes is typical of trunk paraxial mesoderm maturing into muscle, sclerotome and associated connective tissues.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • Strong over-representation of motifs bound by HOX/PBX/MEIS, FOX, SOX, PAX, DLX, NKX, LHX, TBX, MEF2, TCF/LEF and E2F families.  
   • These motifs match the TF repertoire required for A–P positional identity, somitogenesis, myogenesis and the cell-cycle burst that accompanies tissue expansion.  
   • Presence of KDM2B/CXXC motif (CpG-binding) suggests a role for CpG-rich, developmental “CpG-island” enhancers.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Taken together, the accessibility profile, gene neighbourhood and motif landscape indicate that this peak-cluster corresponds to enhancers that:  
   • Are opened in neuromesodermal progenitors as they exit the tail-bud,  
   • Reach maximal activity in late (≈30-somite) paraxial mesoderm / somites,  
   • Drive the transcriptional network that confers posterior HOX identity and initiates muscle and connective-tissue differentiation.

In short, peak-cluster 0 captures the regulatory elements that choreograph the final stages of trunk segmentation and the onset of myogenesis in the zebrafish embryo.

## Cluster 32

[*assistant*:
Summary of peak cluster 0

• Global chromatin activity  
Pseudobulk accessibility is detectable in virtually every tissue and stage that was profiled (values ~4–6 on log-scale).  Accessibility is slightly higher in neuromesodermal-related samples (NMPs, posterior PSM, tail-bud) and in post-mitotic neural derivatives (hindbrain, spinal cord, enteric and other neurons) at late–somite stages, but the signal never drops to background in any lineage.  This indicates that the peaks in this cluster are not lineage-restricted “on/off” elements, but rather constitute a set of regulatory regions that remain broadly open throughout somitogenesis and are reused in many cell types.

• Gene content  
More than 6,000 genes are linked to the peaks.  They are heavily enriched for transcriptional regulators and chromatin or signalling components that set up body-axis patterning and organ primordia, e.g.  
 – Homeobox genes: complete Hox A/B/C/D representation, Pbx/Meis cofactors, Uncx, Lhx, Dlx, Msx, Lmx, Barx, Vsx, etc.  
 – Forkhead and Sox families (FoxA/B/C/D/F/I, SoxB1/B2/C/E/H groups).  
 – Numerous nuclear receptors (Rarg/ Rxr/ Ror/ Nr2f/ Ppara/ Ppard/ Esrr/ Vdr).  
 – Pax, Nkx, Gata, Tbx, Six, Irx, Runx, Ets, Mef2, Klf/Sp, Bach/Maf, E2f, Smad, Tcf/Lef and others.  
Many of these genes act near the top of developmental hierarchies, consistent with the ubiquitous but graded chromatin signal seen across tissues.

• Motif enrichment  
The over-represented motifs mirror the gene list:  
 1. Sox / Fox / Hox / Pax / Nkx / Irx / Six / Tcf-Lef sites – typical of early ectoderm, mesoderm and axial progenitors.  
 2. Nuclear-receptor half-sites (RAR/RXR, Nr2f/COUP-TF, PPAR, ROR) – key mediators of retinoic-acid and lipid signalling along the AP axis.  
 3. E-box and bHLH factors (NeuroD/Neurog, Twist, Myod family) – marking commitment to neural and myogenic lineages.  
 4. Mef2, Runx, Gata and Smad motifs – readouts of muscle, blood/endothelium and BMP/TGFβ pathways.  
 5. Broad architectural factors (CTCF, YY1, Rest) indicating that some peaks are constitutive promoters or insulators.

• Biological interpretation  
Cluster 0 appears to represent a “core developmental regulatory” chromatin module: promoters and proximal enhancers of master regulators that need to stay accessible in most embryonic cells so they can be rapidly redeployed as cells choose specific fates.  The modest yet ubiquitous accessibility, the highly redundant transcription-factor repertoire and the enrichment for axial-patterning motifs together point to regions that underlie the gradual transition of neuromesodermal progenitors into more specialised neural, mesodermal and endodermal derivatives during zebrafish somitogenesis.

## Cluster 33

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 is a very “broad-accessibility” group of regulatory elements.

1. Chromatin-accessibility profile  
   • Pseudo-bulk signal is high (≈20–27 RPKM–style units) in every cell type and at every somite stage that was profiled.  
   • The signal is only modestly modulated – it is slightly higher in rapidly differentiating derivatives (neurons, endocrine pancreas, heart, somitic muscle) and slightly lower in late epidermis/floor-plate samples – but it never turns off.  
   • This pattern is typical of promoter-proximal or housekeeping regulatory regions that remain open in virtually all cells.

2. Gene content  
   • The peak set is associated with an extremely large gene cohort (thousands of loci, from actb2 and gapdh to most of the canonical developmental regulators such as hox, sox, pax, nkx, tbx, gata, mef2, etc.).  
   • Functional scope therefore ranges from basal metabolism to lineage-restricted transcription factors; the common denominator is that these genes tend to be expressed (at least basally) in many tissues throughout early development.

3. DNA-motif enrichment  
   • The motifs with positive z-scores include classical “ubiquitous” or pioneer families (SOX, FOX, CTCF/YY1, ETS, CREB/ATF, MEF2, NR) as well as homeobox signatures (HOX, DLX, PAX, NKX).  
   • Negative scores for several other motifs suggest that the cluster is not strongly enriched for more cell-type-restricted factors (e.g. certain bZIP or AP-1 subclasses).

4. TF-to-motif mapping  
   • The motif-to-factor table confirms representation of virtually every major developmental TF family (Sox, Fox, Hox, Pax, Nkx, Dlx, Six, Tbx, Gata, Mef2, Ets, Nuclear-receptor, Runx, etc.).  
   • Many of these factors are pioneer‐like and can bind nucleosomal DNA, consistent with a constitutively open state.

Interpretation  
Peak-cluster 0 most likely corresponds to a genome-wide set of constitutively accessible promoters (and a subset of broad enhancers) that prime—and often actively drive—the transcription of both housekeeping genes and the key developmental regulators needed across multiple lineages during zebrafish somitogenesis. Its universal accessibility, universal motif repertoire and huge gene list make it the chromatin “backbone” upon which more specialized, stage- and lineage-specific peak clusters (not shown here) are expected to build finer regulatory control.

## Cluster 34

[*assistant*:
Cluster 0 in this peak-calling run corresponds to a set of cis-regulatory elements that switch on just after the onset of somitogenesis and reach maximal chromatin accessibility in ectoderm-derived lineages, especially the neural-crest population.

1. Pattern of accessibility  
   • Very low signal in axial progenitors (NMP) and presomitic mesoderm.  
   • Rapid increase between the 5- and 15-somite stages.  
   • Highest values in migrating / differentiating neural-crest cells (≈40 a.u. at 10–20 somites) and, to a lesser degree, surface epidermis and early trunk/cranial muscle.  
   • Accessibility declines again by the 30-somite stage in most tissues.

2. Gene content of the cluster  
   The 1 000+ genes linked to these peaks are heavily enriched for:  
   • Core neural-crest transcription factors and signalling genes – e.g. sox10, foxd3, pax3/7, lef1, twist1/2, tbx1/2, mitfa, tyr, slc45a2.  
   • ECM remodelers and migratory machinery – collagens (col16a1, col27a1b), lox/loxl, adamts5/8/10/17, sulf1/2, cilp, dcn.  
   • Guidance / receptor genes important for cell dispersion (pdgfra, epha4b, robo1, nrp2a, sema4a/6e).  
   • Melanophore and glial markers (mitfa, mbp, s100b), matching later neural-crest derivatives.

3. Motif enrichment  
   The peak set is strongly enriched for binding sites of transcription-factor families that drive neural-crest and ectodermal programmes:  
   • SOX family (SOX10/9/8, SOX21/14/3) – multiple high-scoring M04417/M06184 motifs.  
   • FOX family (FOXC1, FOXD3, FOXG1) – high M04320/M06010 scores.  
   • PAX3/7, PAX6 and other paired-box factors (motif cluster 33/54).  
   • Homeobox (HOX, DLX, LHX, MSX) and PBX/MEIS co-factors, reflecting rostro-caudal patterning.  
   • ETS/AP-2 and AP-1 families (FOS/JUN, TFAP2), consistent with epithelial–mesenchymal transition and migratory behaviour.  
   • Moderate enrichment of E2F/KLF motifs, in line with the burst of proliferation that accompanies crest delamination.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Taken together, the accessibility profile, gene roster and motif landscape indicate that Cluster 0 represents a neural-crest/cranial ectoderm enhancer module. These elements become active as crest cells delaminate from the dorsal neural tube (5–10 somites), remain open while the cells migrate and start lineage-specific differentiation (pigment, glia, skeletal precursors) and then close again once migration is largely complete (≈30 somites).

In short, Cluster 0 captures the regulatory programme that orchestrates neural-crest emergence, migration and early differentiation during zebrafish segmentation stages.

## Cluster 35

[*assistant*:
Summary of the peak-cluster

1. Global accessibility pattern  
• The peaks that define this cluster are “open” in nearly every embryonic cell type at the 0- to 20-somite stages (pseudobulk values ≈ 3.6–4.3).  
• Accessibility drops sharply by the 30-somite stage in most lineages (values fall to 0.5–0.7 in NMPs, PSM, muscle, heart, etc.).  
• Thus the cluster marks an early, transient chromatin state that is largely shared by neuro-mesodermal progenitors, paraxial mesoderm, nascent neural plate/crest, endoderm and somitic muscle before lineage-specific closure occurs.

2. Gene content (nearest/linked genes)  
• The associated gene list is very large (> 2 500 entries) but strongly enriched for master regulators of early patterning:  
  – Homeobox genes (Hox A/B/C/D series, Prrx, Msx, Lhx, Uncx, Barx, Evx, Emx, Gbx, Dlx, Pax, Six).  
  – Forkhead/Sox/Gata families and other pioneer factors (FoxA/B/C/D/F/G/K, Sox1/2/3/9/10/17/19, Gata3/4/5/6).  
  – Early signalling or structural genes involved in axis extension and somitogenesis (Fgf, Wnt, Tbx, Notch modulators, Mesp, Ripply, MyoD family, Runx, Twist, Meox, Meis/Pbx).  
• GO terms that emerge from this list (not shown but evident from gene identities) relate to axis specification, somitogenesis, neural plate border formation and early organ primordia.

3. Motif enrichment  
• The same developmental families dominate the motif table: Sox, Fox, Hox/Pbx/Meis, Pax, Nkx, Tbx, Six, Irx, Lhx, Gata, Runx, bHLH (NeuroD/Ascl/Twist/MyoD), E-box (E12/E47), nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, PPAR, ROR, Rev-Erb), Mef2, E2F and pioneer insulator CTCF/Klf.  
• Presence of both “pluripotency-style” motifs (Sox, Fox, Klf, CTCF) and lineage-restricted motifs (MyoD, NeuroD, Mef2, Runx, Gata) explains why the peaks are open in many cell types early and then close as cells specialise.

4. Biological interpretation  
• This cluster represents a genome-wide set of early embryonic enhancers/promoters that are generically accessible during gastrulation and early somitogenesis, enabling multiple lineage programs to be executed.  
• As differentiation proceeds (≈ 30 somites, 24 hpf+), most of these regions are selectively closed in each lineage, leaving only the subset needed for that lineage’s mature gene expression profile.  
• Functionally, the cluster likely underpins trunk elongation, somite segmentation, neural tube and neural crest formation, and the first appearance of organ primordia.

In short, the peak-cluster captures the “common embryonic ground state” of chromatin accessibility that supports early patterning across ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm, after which the chromatin landscape becomes progressively lineage-restricted.
]

## Cluster 0

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 0 corresponds to regulatory regions that become progressively more accessible as neuro-mesodermal progenitors commit to a neuronal fate.

1. Cell-type/time-course profile  
   • Accessibility is modest and fairly uniform in early NMP, PSM, endoderm or epidermis (~1.4–1.9).  
   • It rises sharply in neural derivatives once somitogenesis begins.  
     – Differentiating neurons: 10 s – 30 s reach the highest values (≈ 10-14).  
     – Enteric / visceral neurons: already high at 0 s (≈ 5.8), peaking at 15-20 s (≈ 14-16).  
     – Spinal cord, floor-plate and hindbrain show a moderate but consistent increase (~2–3).  
   • Non-neural tissues (muscle, somites, heart, endoderm, mesoderm) remain at baseline.

2. Gene content  
   The 250 + linked genes are typical of post-mitotic or maturing neurons:  
   • Synaptic vesicle and membrane excitability genes (snap25b, syt1a, sv2c, cacna2d3/4, kcnj3a, grin2b, gria3b, scn3b).  
   • Axon guidance / adhesion molecules (cntn3b/5, cntnap2a, nrxn2/3, unc5c, tenm2, sema5a, sdk1b).  
   • Transcriptional regulators tied to neuronal identity (rbfox1/3, nrg1, prkca, trim67, prkg1a).  
   • Extracellular matrix and ECM receptors relevant to neurite outgrowth (thsd7a/b, col4a4, galnt9).

3. Motif enrichment  
   Motifs are dominated by neural and patterning factors:  
   • Proneural / neurogenic bHLH: NEUROD, ATOH, OLIG, ASCL.  
   • SOX and FOX families that drive neural crest and CNS progenitor programmes.  
   • HOX–PBX/MEIS, LIM (Lhx/Mnx/Isl) and PAX / IRX motifs, reflecting rostro–caudal and dorsal–ventral patterning.  
   • Activity-dependent/CREB-ATF-Jun and nuclear-receptor (RORA/RXR/RAR/NR2F) motifs – often seen in late neuronal maturation.  
   • Minor enrichment for E2F and cell-cycle factors, consistent with the transition from cycling progenitor to post-mitotic neuron.

In summary, this peak cluster marks a pan-neuronal enhancer set that switches on around the 10-somite stage, reaches maximal activity in differentiating and enteric neurons during mid-somitogenesis, and is driven by classical neural specification and patterning transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 1

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 1 corresponds to a set of regulatory regions that are

1. Temporally dynamic – they are broadly accessible from the shield/0-somite stage through ~20 somites in virtually every germ-layer–derived population and then shut down (or greatly diminish) by the 30-somite stage in most tissues.  The only clear late exceptions are paraxial‐mesoderm derivatives (PSM / somites) and to a lesser extent fast-muscle, in which accessibility is still high.

2. Spatially biased – the strongest accessibility signal is seen in axial progenitor domains (neuromesodermal progenitors, PSM, early spinal cord / hind- and mid-brain) and in tissues that arise directly from them (neural tube, somites, early muscle).  Accessibility is weak or absent in ectodermal derivatives such as mature epidermis or hatching-gland and in definitive endoderm lineages at later stages.

3. Gene-content signature – the nearest genes are overwhelmingly transcriptional regulators and chromatin/ signalling controllers that are classically involved in trunk patterning and early lineage choices (large blocks of Hox, Sox, Fox, Pax, Nkx/Lhx, Dlx, Runx, Tbx, Gata, Mef2, CTCF/KDM2, E2F, etc.).  Many of them (e.g. Sox2/3/19, Foxa/g, Hoxa/b clusters, Tbx16, Mef2, Gata4/5/6, E2Fs) are pioneer or patterning factors that shape chromatin during gastrulation and early segmentation.

4. Motif / TF-enrichment – de-novo motif analysis recovers exactly these families:
   • pioneer/lineage priming factors (Sox-B, Fox-A/G, Klf, Gata)  
   • A-P patterning and neuronal/mesoderm selectors (Hox/Pbx/Meis, Pax, Lhx, Nkx, Dlx, Irx, Six, Tcf/Lef, Runx, Tbx)  
   • cell-cycle/replication regulators (E2F, MYBL, Mcm-associated motifs) that match the highly proliferative state of axial progenitors  
   • stress/ubiquitous architectural factors (CTCF, REST, YY1, Bach/MAF, CREB/ATF).

Taken together these peaks look like classical “early trunk enhancer” elements: they open genome-wide as soon as dorsal / trunk progenitors are specified, remain active during convergent extension and segmentation to drive Hox-, Sox-, Fox-, Pax-dependent programs that allocate neuromesodermal fates, and are then progressively closed once cells leave the progenitor niche and become committed epidermis, stable endoderm, or late visceral organs.  Their long retention in PSM / somites suggests a continued requirement for these enhancers in myogenic and somitic maturation.

In short, peak-cluster 1 marks the cis-regulatory landscape of early axial progenitors and their immediate neural-mesoderm descendants, governed by a rich network of Sox/Fox/Hox/Pax/Nkx transcription factors that orchestrate trunk patterning and lineage commitment in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster #0 corresponds to a very “broad-accessibility” set of regulatory regions.

1. Chromatin‐accessibility / expression pattern  
   • Across almost every embryonic compartment the signal is modest and fairly uniform (log CPM ≈ 4–6).  
   • A noticeable jump (≈ 22 log CPM) appears in enteric-neurons at the 30-somite stage, and slightly higher values are also seen in differentiating neuronal, spinal-cord and floor-plate samples.  
   • NMPs, PSM, tail-bud, endoderm, epidermis, muscle, heart and most mesodermal derivatives all show the same “house-keeping–level” accessibility.

   →  The cluster therefore behaves like a set of regulatory elements that are open almost everywhere, but gain extra accessibility once cells commit to neuronal / neuro-ectodermal fates, with enteric neurons being the clearest outlier.

2. Gene content  
   • The peak set is linked to a very large list of genes that is heavily enriched for neuronal functions: axon-guidance receptors (ROBO1/2, UNC5s, NRP1/2), synaptic vesicle machinery (RIMS2, UNC13B, SYT2, SNAP25, SV2A), voltage-gated ion channels (multiple KCN, CACN family members), neurotransmitter receptors (GABR, GRIN, GRIA, GRM families) and neuro-trophic signalling components (ERBB4, NPAS3, NRGs).  
   • Patterning and cell-adhesion genes (Hox clusters, PAX, Lhx, Cadherins, Contactins, Tenm, Plxn/Sema) are also abundant, consistent with broad trunk patterning and axon-pathfinding roles.  
   • Many ubiquitous chromatin and metabolic genes are present, explaining the low but widespread baseline accessibility.

3. Motif / transcription-factor enrichment  
   Highly significant enrichment is seen for:  
   • SOX family (SOX1/2/3/10/11/14/21/32) – pan-neural competence.  
   • HOX, PBX/MEIS, CUX, FOX and PAX families – A–P patterning and regional identity.  
   • NEUROD/ATOH/OLIG, MEF2 and SRF – neuronal differentiation and activity-dependent remodelling.  
   • NKX2/4/6, LHX, DMRT, GATA, TBX – mesodermal / endodermal and visceral-motor specification.  
   • RUNX, ETS (ELK/ETV/FLI), NF-κB/STAT, CREB/ATF and BATF/BACH modules – signalling responsiveness.

   The breadth of TF classes explains why the cluster is open in many progenitors yet becomes most active in neurons: different lineages can use overlapping subsets of these motifs.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Taken together, this peak-set most likely represents a trunk “pan-developmental / pan-neuronal primed” chromatin state:  
   • It is constitutively accessible at a low level in virtually all cells (house-keeping and patterning functions).  
   • During neural differentiation—especially in late enteric neurons—it becomes strongly activated, driving high expression of neuron-specific effector genes.  
   • The heavy representation of HOX, PBX/MEIS and FOX/PAX motifs suggests these regions integrate anterior–posterior patterning information with neurogenic programmes.

In short, peak-cluster #0 is a ubiquitous but neuro-biased regulatory module whose accessibility peaks in maturing trunk / enteric neurons while remaining moderately open in most other somitogenesis-stage tissues.
]

## Cluster 3

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 0 captures a set of regulatory regions that become progressively more accessible in neuro-ectodermal derivatives as somitogenesis proceeds.

1. Cell types in which the peaks are most accessible  
   • Very high pseudobulk signals in eye/retina (optic-cup 0–30 som), neural floor-plate, mid-/hind-brain boundary, hind-brain, spinal cord and differentiating neurons.  
   • Moderate signals in generic “neural”, “neurons” and “tail-bud” samples.  
   • Low-to-moderate accessibility in mesodermal (PSM, somite, muscle) and endodermal populations, and minimal signal in non-neural lineages such as blood, germ cells or pronephros.

2. Gene content of the peaks  
   The 5 000+ linked genes are heavily skewed toward neural/retinal functions:  
   • Axon guidance / synaptogenesis: LRRTM4, UNC5C, GRIK2/3/4, SYT2, SNAP25-related genes, CNTN/CNTNAP, NRXN1/3, PTPR family, RAB26, BRSK2, TRIM67, MAGI3, SHANK3, TANC2.  
   • Neural patterning & differentiation regulators: NPAS3, FOXD1, PAX6/7, SOX2/3/11/21, OTX1/2, CRX, VSX2, RX1/2, IRX homeobox, HOX A/B/C cluster members, ZIC2/4/5, DLX, LHX, NKX, MEIS/PBX.  
   • Retina-specific or optic-cup markers: CABP4, RORβ/γ, RAX (rx1/2/3), NRL, NR2E3, VSX2, OPN4.  
   • Many neuronal ion-channels (CACNA, KCN, SCN, GRIA, GRIN), ECM/remodelling genes (ADAMTS, TENM, COLLAGENS), and guidance molecules (ROBO, SLIT, EPH/Ephrin, SEMAs).

3. Transcription-factor motif enrichment  
   Motifs over-represented in the cluster correspond to:  
   • Early neuroectoderm/retina factors – SOX (SOX2/3/5/19), PAX (PAX6/7), RAX, CRX, VSX, ZIC, OTX, IRX, HOX, DLX, LHX, MEIS/PBX.  
   • Ventral midline & Shh pathway – GLI1/2/3, FOXA/Fox family, NKX2.2/2.4/2.9.  
   • General neurogenic bHLH and E-box factors – NEUROD, ATOH, ASCL, OLIG, TCF/LEF.  
   • Retinoid / nuclear receptors – RAR, RXR, ROR, NR2F, ESR, PPARG-like.  
   • Chromatin regulators (CTCF, KDM2, CXXC, REST) suggesting boundary/insulator elements.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Taken together, the accessibility pattern, gene annotation and TF-motif profile indicate that this peak cluster marks enhancers and promoters that are active in the developing central nervous system—particularly the retina/optic cup and ventral midline—and become increasingly open as progenitors exit the neuro-mesodermal state and differentiate into specialised neuronal subtypes during the 0–30 somite window.

In brief, cluster 0 represents a “neural/retinal enhancer set” that tracks the maturation of CNS and eye tissues during zebrafish somitogenesis.

## Cluster 4

[*assistant*:
Summary of “peak-cluster-0”

1. Cell-type / stage specificity  
   • Chromatin accessibility (pseudobulk signal) is essentially uniform (≈1.4–2.0) across most tissues, but explodes to >40-fold in “optic_cup 15-somites”.  
   • A modest secondary enrichment is seen in “optic_cup 10- & 20-somites” and “optic_cup 30-somites”, whereas every other sample stays at baseline.  
   ⇒  The peaks therefore mark regulatory elements that switch on specifically in the optic cup between 10- and 20-somite stages (≈14–18 hpf), the time when the bilayered optic vesicle invaginates to form the optic cup.

2. Gene content (nearest genes)  
   • Classic eye-field / early-retina regulators are present: rx1/2/3, pax6a/b, vsx1/2, otx1/2/5, six3/6/7, lhx2/9, crx, tbx2/3, meis, pbx, barhl, vax1/2, hmx1/3, hoxa1/5, hoxb2/4, etc.  
   • Genes required for retinal neurogenesis and photoreceptor differentiation: neurod1/4/6, atoh7, proneural bHLHs, bhlhe23, prdm16, maf family, runx3, nrl, ror, etc.  
   • Eye morphogenesis / extracellular matrix: fras1, col4a1/2, loxl4/5, lama5, lamb2, lamb2, matn4, agrin, agrn, plxna2, robo1/2.  
   • Signalling components frequently used during optic-cup patterning: fgf7/18, wnt2/4/5b/6b, bmp5/16, notch pathway genes, hedgehog (gli1/2/3).  
   The gene catalogue is, therefore, heavily biased toward eye-field specification, optic-cup morphogenesis and nascent retinal neuronal differentiation.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   • Homeobox group: Rx, Pax (2/6/7), Six, Lhx, Otx, Vax, Hox clusters → canonical eye-field transcription factors.  
   • Sox & Fox families – general neural/ectodermal competence and optic-stalk signalling.  
   • bHLH family: Atoh1/7, NeuroD, Olig, Tcf/LeF, Myc/Max, clock genes (Bhlhe41/23) – consistent with proliferative retinal progenitors and the first neurogenic waves.  
   • Nuclear receptors: RAR/RXR, NR2F (Coup-TF), ROR, PPAR – typical of retinoic-acid and lipid-signalling‐responsive retina.  
   • E2F/TEAD/MEF2/NFAT motifs point to concurrent cell-cycle control and cytoskeletal remodelling during cup invagination.  
   Collectively, the motif landscape mirrors the gene list and pinpoints the transcriptional network that establishes and maintains the optic cup / early neural-retina identity.

4. Biological interpretation  
   This peak cluster captures the burst of enhancer/promoter activity that accompanies transformation of the optic vesicle into the optic cup and the onset of retinal neurogenesis.  It is largely silent elsewhere, underscoring its high tissue specificity.  The associated genes and TF motifs align with the canonical eye-field → retinal progenitor → early neuron trajectory in zebrafish embryos around 14–20 hpf.

In short, the cluster represents optic-cup–specific regulatory elements driving early retinal development.
]

## Cluster 0

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 0 contains regulatory elements that are most open in neural lineages.

1. Pseudobulk accessibility pattern  
   • Low/constitutive signal (≈1.4–1.8) in virtually every tissue at the bud stage.  
   • Strong, stage-dependent increase in differentiating neurons and neuronal derivatives:  
     – Differentiating neurons: 3 → 14 (0 → 30 somites).  
     – Enteric neurons: 6 → 16 (0 → 20 somites).  
     – Floor-plate, spinal cord, hindbrain and neural crest show moderate enrichment.  
   • Only background-level signal in mesodermal, endodermal or epidermal derivatives and in muscle.

   This profile is typical of pan-neuronal enhancers that turn on after gastrulation and remain active throughout neurogenesis.

2. Gene content of the peak set  
   • Neuronal identity / synaptic function: syn1, snap25b, syt1a/9a, sv2bb/c, rbfox1/3, nrxn2a/3b, cntn3b/5, nrg1, gria3b, grin2bb, grid2, ryr3, unc5c, epha6, sema5a, plxna3, tenm2, tnr, mdga2a, crmp1.  
   • Axon guidance & cell-adhesion (PCDH, CNTNAP, LRR, MAGI3, CTNND2a).  
   • Neuronal TF/RBP genes: nfixa/b, rbfox1/3, foxn2, trhde, trpm5, timm21, trim67 etc.  
   • Only sporadic non-neural genes (e.g. abcc8, wt1a), reflecting ubiquitous or neighbouring loci.

   Taken together, the gene list reads like a catalogue of late neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis genes.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   • Early neuroectoderm & multipotency: SOX (Sox2/3/19/21), FOX (Foxd3/Foxg1), PAX.  
   • Patterning / regionalisation: broad panel of HOX, DLX, LHX, IRX, POU, NKX, SIX.  
   • Differentiation-driving bHLH factors: NEUROD/ATOH, OLIG, TFAP4, TCF/LEF.  
   • Pan-neuronal nuclear receptors: RAR/RXR, COUP-TF (Nr2f), THRB.  
   • Cell-cycle exit regulators: E2F, KDM2, KLF.  
   The combination matches the transcriptional circuitry that converts neuroectodermal progenitors into region-specific, post-mitotic neurons under retinoic-acid control.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Peak-cluster 0 represents a set of enhancers that switch on when neural progenitors leave the proliferative zone and begin terminal differentiation, first detectable around the 5-somite stage and peaking by 20–30 somites.  They are shared by central (hindbrain, spinal cord, floor plate) and peripheral (enteric, neural-crest-derived) neurons, consistent with a “pan-neuronal maturation” regulatory module.

In short, cluster 0 marks late-stage neuronal enhancers whose accessibility rises sharply during somitogenesis and whose sequence carries binding sites for the major transcription factors that drive neuronal differentiation and regional identity in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 1

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 1 corresponds to a group of chromatin regions that are most open in axial-mesoderm lineages during segmentation.

1. Activity pattern  
   • Accessibility is already high in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) from 0- to 20-somite stages (≈2-2.4 a.u.) and becomes even stronger in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), peaking at the 30-somite stage (5.9 a.u.).  
   • Accessibility drops sharply in NMPs by the 30-somite stage and is low-to-absent in differentiated derivatives (fast muscle, epidermis, tail-bud, optic, etc.), indicating that these peaks mark the trunk-mesoderm programme rather than terminal fates.

2. Associated gene set  
   The 3 000 + linked genes are heavily enriched for developmental regulators that pattern the trunk and promote mesoderm maturation, e.g.  
   • Segmentation / patterning: dozens of Hox paralogues, mesp family, uncx, tbx6, tbx16, ripply, wnt3/5/11, fgf8/18, notch ligands, her/hes genes.  
   • Extracellular-matrix remodelling: many Adam/Adamts, Col I/III/V, Mmp, Lama/Lamb/Lamc, Timp, Fbn.  
   • Signalling and morphogenesis modulators: Fox (foxa/f/d/i), Sox (sox2/3/5/6/9/10), Runx, Mef2, Pax, Nkx, Pbx/Meis, nuclear receptors (Rara/Rarg, Rxr, Ror, Nr2f/COUP).

3. Motif enrichment  
   Motifs most over-represented in these peaks belong to:  
   • Homeobox (HOX, PBX, MEIS) → rostro-caudal patterning, somite identity.  
   • Forkhead (FOX A/C/D/F/I/K), SOX, TCF/LEF → integration of Wnt/FGF and maintenance of progenitors.  
   • NK/TBX, RUNX, MEF2 → mesoderm differentiation and early myogenesis.  
   • Nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR, COUP-TF, ROR, PPAR) → retinoic-acid and lipid/RA cross-talk that times somite maturation.  
   • Pro-proliferative sets (E2F, NF-Y) → sustained cell-cycle activity of elongating PSM.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Together, the expression profile, gene content and motif landscape indicate that peak cluster 1 marks enhancers active in trunk extension and somitogenesis.  These elements integrate Wnt/FGF (axis elongation), retinoic-acid (maturation) and cell-cycle inputs to drive the HOX-centred transcriptional network that specifies positional identity and orchestrates the transition from multipotent NMPs to segmental PSM tissue.

In short, peak cluster 1 captures the regulatory blueprint of the elongating presomitic mesoderm—highly accessible while the embryo is making somites, then largely shut down as tissues terminally differentiate.

## Cluster 2

[*assistant*:
Peak‐cluster 2 corresponds to a large group of very “generic” peaks that behave almost like housekeeping promoters.

1. Accessibility pattern  
•  In every lineage and at every somite stage the pseudobulk signal sits in the same narrow window (about 4–6 on the arbitrary accessibility scale).  
•  No obvious lineage-specific spikes are seen (the single 22-value in 30 s enteric neurons is almost certainly a depth-normalisation artefact).  
→  The peaks are therefore constitutively open rather than stage- or tissue-restricted.

2. Associated genes  
•  Because the cluster is so broadly accessible it is linked to an unusually long list of genes – essentially a catalogue of ubiquitously expressed metabolic, structural and basic-process genes in early zebrafish embryos.  
•  The list contains many core cellular regulators (ribosomal proteins, chromatin remodelers, DNA-repair factors, cell-cycle genes, basal TFs, etc.) as well as a sprinkling of lineage-specific genes that are probably captured because their promoters are always “on standby”.

3. Motif/TF enrichment  
•  Motifs that typify constitutively open promoters are strongly enriched, e.g. E2F, NF-Y, CREB/ATF, SP/KLF, YY1, CTCF, NRF/NR2F, and basic leucine-zipper factors.  
•  Pioneer-type motifs (SOX, FOX, GATA) are also present, consistent with their ability to keep promoters nucleosome-free in early embryos.  
•  No single lineage-defining motif dominates, reinforcing the idea that the peaks are not restricted to a specific cell type.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, cluster 2 appears to be a promoter-heavy, housekeeping peak set that provides the basal chromatin framework required for general transcription across virtually all tissues during the 0- to 30-somite window of zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 3

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 3 corresponds to a neuro-ectoderm / neuronal enhancer module.

1. Spatiotemporal activity  
   • The pseudobulk signal is already moderate in undifferentiated neural lineages (NMPs, neural plate, neural crest) but rises steeply once overt neurogenesis starts.  
   • Highest values are seen in “differentiating_neurons”, “neurons”, “hindbrain”, “mid-/hindbrain boundary”, “spinal cord” and “optic cup”, and they continue to climb from the 0-somite stage to ≥30 somites.  
   • Mesodermal (PSM, muscle, somites) or endodermal (endoderm, pancreas, pronephros) samples show only baseline levels, indicating a neural-specific programme.

2. Gene content (selected examples from the 1 300 + list)  
   • Neuronal adhesion / axon guidance: CNTN1/2/5, CNTNAP2/3, LRRTM4, L1CAM family, ROBO1-4, PLXNA1-4, SEMA3/4/5/6.  
   • Synaptic vesicle and transmission genes: SYT2, UNC13B, SV2C, RAB3D, RIMS2, GRIN2A/B/D, GRIK2/3/4, GABRB2/3/4, CACNA1/2/4 sub-units, KCN* and SCN* ion channels.  
   • Neuronal transcription factors: SOX2/3/5/11/14/19, PAX3/6/7, IRX1-6, OTX1/2, LHX1/2/4/5/9, DLX1-6, HOX (especially B/C cluster), NPAS3, NEUROD family, ASCL1, OLIG2, MEIS/PKNOX, DMRT, SIX.  
   • Pathway components that pattern the neuro-axis: WNT1/3/4/7, SHH, FGFR1/2/3, NOTCH1/2.

3. Motif enrichment / inferred regulators  
   The motif analysis highlights the same TF families that appear in the gene list:  
   • SOX (stem/progenitor maintenance) – strongest overall enrichment.  
   • FOX and HOX/Irx/Pax homeodomain factors (anterior-posterior and dorsoventral patterning).  
   • LHX/DLX/MEIS/PKNOX and PBX (neuronal subtype specification).  
   • RA-receptor/RXR and E2F motifs, suggesting retinoic-acid responsiveness and a link to early cell-cycle exit.  
   • bHLH neurogenic drivers (NEUROD, ATOH/OLIG) and MEF2, consistent with later neuronal maturation.

4. Biological interpretation  
Cluster 3 therefore represents a set of cis-regulatory elements that switch on as neural progenitors leave the cell cycle and differentiate, and remain active in maturing neurons throughout the trunk and brain.  The enrichment for HOX/Irx/Pax motifs implies that the same enhancer set is reused along the rostro-caudal axis, while SOX/FOX factors couple early neural identity to later subtype-specific programmes.  Retinoic-acid and Wnt/FGF inputs likely gate this network, in line with known RA-dependent patterning of the zebrafish hindbrain and spinal cord.

In summary, peak cluster 3 marks the core neurogenic enhancer landscape of the zebrafish embryo: low in multipotent progenitors, sharply up-regulated from ~10 somites onward, and sustained in diverse neuronal lineages as they mature.
]

## Cluster 4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 4 contains a set of open chromatin regions that are already accessible in the 0-somite embryo and remain moderately open in most tissues throughout the first 30 somites.  Accessibility is strongest in neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMP), presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and all neural derivatives (hind-/mid-/fore-brain, spinal cord, neural crest, floor-plate, optic cup).  It is weaker or absent in fast skeletal muscle, epidermis and late tail-bud, indicating that the elements belong to a broadly “neuro-ectoderm/mesoderm” programme rather than a general housekeeping set.

The linked gene catalogue (≈2 600 loci) is heavily enriched for:
• neuronal specification and function – ion channels (CACNA, KCN, SCN, TRP, RYR), neurotransmitter receptors (GABA-A/B, GRIN/K, GRM, HTR), synaptic vesicle and active-zone components (RIMS, UNC13, SV2, SHANK, SYT) and axon-guidance/adhesion molecules (ROBO, PLXN, CNTN, UNC5, L1CAM, CDH18/22/23).  
• patterning/ECM and signalling genes (many Hox clusters, FGF/FGFRs, BMP/TGF-β modulators, collagens, integrins).

Motif analysis depicts a clear developmental signature.  The most over-represented motifs belong to:
1. Homeobox families (HOX, DLX, LHX, MSX, BARHL, TLX, GBX, VAX) – conferring anterior–posterior and dorsoventral neural patterning cues.  
2. Forkhead factors (FOXA/C/D/F/K/O, FOXG1, FOXI) and SOX family (SOX2/3/5/8/9/10/11/14/19/21) – typical pioneers of neural and mesodermal chromatin.  
3. Pax/Irx/Nkx/Uncx/Barx subsets and several Six, Meis/Pbx and Tbx factors – further supporting regional neural and mesoderm specification.  
4. A background of E-box (NeuroD/Ascl, bHLH) and MEF2/SRF sites consistent with neuronal differentiation and activity.

Taken together, peak-cluster 4 most likely represents a collection of cis-regulatory elements that establish and maintain the broad neuro-ectodermal transcriptional landscape while integrating axial patterning information from HOX and allied homeobox genes.  These enhancers stay accessible from very early segmentation stages and continue to support neuronal differentiation, neural crest development and mesodermal derivatives but are selectively shut down in lineages such as fast muscle and surface ectoderm.
]

## Cluster 5

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 5 represents a set of early segmentation-stage enhancers that are

1. Most accessible in surface ectoderm  
   • Epidermis shows the strongest signal (log2 ≈ 37–39 at the 0- to 10-somite stages, falling to ≈ 15 by 30 somites).  

2. Also open, but to a lesser extent, in several early endodermal / mesodermal derivatives  
   • Endocrine pancreas and general endoderm (log2 ≈ 14–17).  
   • Enteric neural crest / enteric neurons (peaking ≈ 21 at 0 somites).  
   • Early trunk muscle / somites (log2 ≈ 12–15).  

3. Linked genes (∼3 000) are rich in  
   • Epidermal and epithelial structural components: many keratins (krt17, krt4, krt18a), claudins, cadherins, collagens.  
   • Early patterning and organ-specification TFs: large blocks of HOX, FOX (foxg1, foxa/f), SOX, PAX, NKX, MEIS/PBX, GATA, TBX, MEF2.  
   • Signalling molecules that pattern the embryo (Wnt3/4/11, Fgf receptors, Notch/Delta, Semaphorins, Eph/Ephrins).  

4. Motif enrichment echoes the gene content  
   • Very strong enrichment for HOX-PBX/MEIS, FOX, SOX, PAX, NKX, GATA, E2F and nuclear-receptor motifs, plus TEAD/MEF2 and AP-1 (FOS/JUN) sites.  
   • This combination is typical of enhancers that integrate anterior-posterior patterning cues with epithelial differentiation programmes.

Taken together, cluster 5 marks a broad set of “priming” enhancers that switch on at the start of segmentation, are especially active in the nascent epidermis, and remain accessible in other early organ-founder populations (gut, pancreas, dermomyotome, neural crest).  They appear to be controlled by canonical axial-patterning (HOX/MEIS, FOX) and epithelial differentiation factors, providing regulatory scaffolds that later refine into lineage-specific programmes as development proceeds.
]

## Cluster 6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 6 contains a very “promiscuous” set of regulatory regions.  
1. Pseudobulk accessibility pattern  
   • Accessibility values are uniformly high (≈ 4–5 a.u.) in almost every lineage that was profiled from 0- to 30-somite stages.  
   • It is especially strong in paraxial-mesoderm-derived tissues (PSM, somites, fast skeletal muscle, hemangioblast / haemo-vascular mesoderm) and in multiple neural derivatives (spinal cord, hind-/mid-brain, floor-plate).  
   • Accessibility drops only in a few late-stage samples such as epidermis-30 s and tail-bud-30 s, indicating that most peaks are already closing in extra-embryonic ectoderm but stay open in the trunk.

2. Genes linked to the peaks  
   • The list (≈ 800 genes) is a mixture of:  
     – Developmental TFs that control axial patterning and progenitor identity (large blocks of Hox a/b/c/d genes, Pax, Dlx, Irx, Lhx, Nkx, Barhl, Msx, Six, Sox and Fox families).  
     – Genes required for contractile/ECM rich mesodermal tissues (Actc1, Ttn, Ryr1b, Col11/12/18, Fn1a, Lama/Lamb).  
     – House-keeping and metabolic genes (ribosomal, cytoskeletal, mitochondrial, cell-cycle).  
   • The spectrum points to chromatin that is active in proliferating trunk progenitors that are still competent to adopt neural, mesodermal and even endodermal fates.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • Strongest motifs: Homeobox (HOX, DLX, IRX, LHX, NKX, BARX, PAX), Forkhead (FOX, FOXC/A/L), SOX, E-box / bHLH, nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR/NR2F/PPAR), E2F/FOXM1 cell-cycle regulators.  
   • These motifs mark enhancers that respond to retinoic-acid and Wnt/FGF signalling, drive posterior axial identity (HOX + RAR/RXR), maintain progenitor proliferation (E2F) and allow rapid lineage choice (SOX/FOX).

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Peak-cluster 6 represents a trunk-wide, retinoic-acid-responsive enhancer set that remains accessible in multipotent neuro-mesodermal progenitors and in their immediate neural, muscle, cardiovascular and haemato-vascular descendants.  
   • Because the same elements stay open across many tissues, the cluster likely includes both “house-keeping” promoters and versatile developmental enhancers that are reused by several lineages during early organogenesis.

In short, cluster 6 captures the chromatin “backbone” of actively proliferating trunk progenitors and early differentiating neural/mesodermal cells—a resource that is shared across numerous vertebrate lineages rather than being confined to a single specialised tissue.
]

## Cluster 7

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 7 corresponds to a neuro-ectodermal/dorsal-neural-tube regulatory module that is already open at gastrula/0-somite stage and remains accessible throughout segmentation (up to ≈30 somites).  

1. Cell-type/activity profile  
  • Pseudobulk accessibility is uniformly high in neural plate, hindbrain, spinal cord, neural-crest, floor-plate and tail-bud samples, but much lower in mesodermal (muscle, somite, PSM), endodermal or epidermal fractions.  
  • The temporal flat-top profile (little change from 0 to 30 somites) suggests these elements mark a prolonged progenitor domain rather than a transient burst of differentiation.

2. Characteristic genes found in the peak set  
  • Patterning / fate: pax3, pax7, irx1/2/3/4/5/6/7, uncx4.1, lmx1a/b, otx, gbx, vax, shox2 – all classical markers of the dorsal/intermediate neural tube and neural-plate border.  
  • Neural-crest and dorsal interneuron regulators: sox9, foxd3, zic1/2/3/5, snai1/2, prrx1/2.  
  • Axon-guidance / synaptic genes that begin to appear as progenitors mature (e.g. robo1/2, unc5c, sema3/5/6 family, gria / grik glutamate-receptor subunits, gabra/b subunits, shank, rimbp2, unc13b).  
  Taken together these genes point to dorsal spinal-cord / hindbrain progenitors that later give rise to neural-crest cells and dorsal interneurons.

3. Transcription-factor motif enrichment  
  • The most over-represented motifs belong to the Pax3/7 and Iroquois (Irx1-7) families, which establish and maintain the dorsal neural tube.  
  • Additional enriched motifs include Sox (border/neural-crest), Zic, Runx and Tcf/Lef sites, indicating Wnt-responsive chromatin and a competence for neural-crest specification.  
  • Virtually no myogenic (Mef2, MyoD) or mesodermal (Tbx6) motifs are enriched, reinforcing the neuro-ectodermal identity.

4. Developmental interpretation  
  Cluster 7 represents a set of enhancers that define the dorsal neural-tube / neural-plate-border territory under the control of Pax3/7-Irx code.  These elements remain accessible while progenitors proliferate and later feed multiple derivatives, including neural-crest cells and dorsal interneurons, thereby acting as a long-lived chromatin signature of the dorsal CNS lineage in zebrafish embryos.
]

## Cluster 8

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 8 marks a set of regulatory elements that become highly accessible in a handful of embryonic “organiser” and pattern-forming territories between the 0- and 30-somite stages.

1. Spatiotemporal activity  
   • The peaks are moderately open (log2 ≈ 10–12) in most tissues but show a striking spike of accessibility in:  
     – Midbrain–hindbrain boundary (17–21)  
     – Pharyngeal / branchial-arch mesenchyme (16–19)  
     – Tail-bud / posterior growth zone (15–19)  
     – Early fast muscle and optic cup also show above–average signals.  
   These domains are classical signalling centres that pattern the neural tube, cranial neural-crest derivatives and posterior mesoderm during somitogenesis.

2. Nearby genes  
   Peaks sit next to an extensive collection of anterior–posterior and dorso-ventral patterning genes, e.g. fgf8a, fgf17, wnt5b, en1/en2, gbx1/2, pax2a/5/8, lmx1a/b, otx1/2, barhl, dlx, irx, meox, tbx, numerous hox paralogues as well as cranial-mesenchyme factors (barx1, hand2, sp8/9).  The gene list also contains many extracellular-matrix and guidance genes (sema, slit, robo, fn1, col family), reflecting active morphogenesis.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   Motif analysis is dominated by:  
   • Neural-crest / border factors: SOX (sox10/9/5/11), FOX (foxd3, foxi, foxg1, foxf), PAX (pax2/3/5/6/7/8).  
   • Segmental and axial regulators: HOX-PBX-MEIS, IRX, DLX, LHX, NKX, TBX.  
   • Proliferation & differentiation modulators: E2F family, MEF2, NF-Y, Nuclear-receptor cluster (RAR/RXR, COUP-TF, NR4A, PPARG).  
   This repertoire matches the gene set and reinforces the idea that these peaks act as hubs for integrating positional cues, retinoid/nuclear-receptor signalling and cell-cycle control during early pattern formation.

In short, peak cluster 8 represents a broad patterning/regionalisation module: chromatin regions that turn on strongly in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, cranial neural-crest/branchial arches and tail-bud as zebrafish embryos begin segmentation.  The associated genes and transcription-factor motifs place this cluster at the core of the genetic circuitry that positions and subdivides the neural tube and adjacent mesoderm while coordinating their rapid growth and morphogenesis.
]

## Cluster 9

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 9 is a neuronal/ neural-crest regulatory module that turns on late in somitogenesis.  Accessibility is already moderate (log2 CPM ≈ 3–4) in most neural tissues, but it rises sharply in peripheral‐neuron derivatives, peaking in enteric neurons at the 30-somite stage (log2 CPM ≈ 11).  Signals also increase in differentiating spinal cord, hind-/mid-brain, floor plate and tail-bud neural crest, while remaining low or absent in non-neural lineages such as epidermis, hatching gland and early mesoderm.

The 1 400+ linked genes are rich in neuronal molecules: axon-guidance and synaptic adhesion proteins (CNTNAP2, CNTN3/4/5, LRFN2, SYT2, RIMS2), voltage-gated ion channels (CACNA2D1, KCNB2, PIEZO2, RYR2), neurotransmitter receptors (GRIK2, GRM7, GABRB2) and cytoskeletal/ signalling regulators (DOCK4/9, RAPGEF4, MAP3K10).  This repertoire is characteristic of maturing peripheral and hind-brain neurons rather than early progenitors.

Motif enrichment points to the transcription-factor grammar that drives this programme:  
• patterning factors that specify posterior neural crest and hind-brain identity (HOX-B/C/D clusters, PAX3/7, IRX, LHX, DLX, UNC-homeobox);  
• SOX, FOX and POU family motifs that sustain neural-crest potency and early neurogenesis;  
• MEF2, RUNX and E2F motifs, suggesting a transition from proliferation to terminal neuronal differentiation;  
• nuclear receptors (ROR, COUP-TF, RXR/RA-receptors) that often sculpt late neuronal maturation.

Taken together, cluster 9 marks enhancers that are progressively opened as neuromesodermal progenitors give rise to neural-crest cells and, ultimately, to posterior peripheral neurons—most prominently the enteric nervous system—between the 10- and 30-somite stages of zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 10

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 10 contains regulatory regions that are almost silent in pluripotent/early germ-layer populations but become progressively more accessible in paraxial mesoderm derivatives.  Accessibility starts to rise in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and nascent somites (≈ 5 som), and then climbs steeply in the myotome—especially the fast-muscle and general “muscle” pseudobulks—reaching its maximum at 20–30-somite stages.  Other lineages (neural tube, endoderm, epidermis, pancreas, etc.) show only low baseline accessibility.

The peaks are linked to a large cohort of muscle–structural and myotome-specific genes: classic sarcomeric components (acta1, actc1, myl1/3/4, myh7, myhz2, tnnt1/2, tnnc2), contractility regulators (ryr1/3, cacna1s, atp2a1), extracellular-matrix genes needed for myofibre attachment (lama2, lamb2, col11a, col12a, fn1), and virtually all core myogenic transcription factors (myod1, myf5, myog, mef2a/b/c/d, srf, pax3/7, tbx4/18, six1/4, etc.).

Motif enrichment mirrors this gene set.  The most strongly over-represented motifs belong to the MADS/MEF2 and SRF families, which are the main transcriptional activators of late myogenic genes.  Homeobox (Pax3/7, Six, Pitx), T-box (Tbx4/18/16), and E-box/bHLH signatures that bind the MyoD / Myf5 proteins are also enriched, fitting a regulatory cascade in which early somitic factors open these elements and the myogenic bHLH + MEF2 partnership subsequently drives high-level expression of structural genes.

Taken together, peak-cluster 10 represents the enhancer repertoire that governs the transition from presomitic mesoderm to differentiated fast-twitch skeletal muscle during the 10–30-somite period of zebrafish development.
]

## Cluster 11

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 11 appears to represent an extensive set of cis-regulatory elements that are preferentially active in the neuro-ectoderm, in particular in neural-tube and early neuronal lineages of the posterior CNS (hind-brain / spinal cord) during segmentation stages.

Key observations

1. Gene neighbourhoods  
   • The associated genes are strongly biased towards neuronal/neurite genes (e.g. ADGRL3, AP3B2, CACNA2D1/2D3, ERBB4, GABRB2, IQSEC1, KCNJ6, NPAS3, PIEZO2, PLCB1, RIMS2, RYR2, SEMA4F, UNC13B, UNC5C, TENM2, TMEM132C).  
   • Numerous cell-adhesion molecules and axon-guidance cues (cadherins, protocadherins, CNTNs, CNTNAPs, ROBO2/3, PLXNs, SLITs) underscore a role in neuronal path-finding and circuit formation.  
   • A large block of posterior HOX genes (C8-C13 class, Hoxb4/5/6/7/8/9, Hoxc/d10-13, Meis/Pbx cofactors) plus PBX/MEIS and Uncx motifs, points to rostro-caudal patterning of the neural tube.

2. Motif / TF enrichment  
   • Very strong enrichment for Sox family motifs (sox2/3/5/9/10/11/17/19) characteristic of neuro-ectodermal progenitors and neural-crest derivatives.  
   • Abundant Fox motifs (FoxA/C/D/F/I/K/L/O, FoxG1) and Paired-box motifs (Pax2/3/5/6/7/8), all central to neural-tube regionalisation.  
   • Posterior patterning factors: Hox, Meis/Pbx, Irx, Tbx, Six, Nkx, Lhx clusters.  
   • Nuclear receptor motifs for retinoic-acid and thyroid-hormone receptors (RAR/RXR, NR2F/COUP-TF, ROR, PPARS) consistent with RA-dependent posterior neural identity.  
   • Neuronal differentiation / synaptogenesis regulators (Mef2, NeuroD/Neurog, Atoh1/7, Runx, Ets/Elk, Egr, Batf/Jun/Fos AP-1).  
   • Proliferative E2F and cell-cycle motifs, indicating activity in cycling neural progenitors as well.

3. Pseudobulk accessibility profile  
   Accessibility is high and relatively uniform (40–55 CPM) across most neural tissues (neural tube, hindbrain, spinal cord, neural crest, neurons) and much lower in mesodermal/endodermal samples, supporting neural specificity.

Summary  
Cluster 11 marks regulatory regions that are:  
• active from 0- to 30-somite stages;  
• enriched in neural progenitors and differentiating neurons of the hind-brain and spinal cord;  
• controlled by Sox/Fox/Hox/Pax/Irx/Six transcriptional networks together with retinoid nuclear-receptor signalling; and  
• linked to genes involved in axon guidance, synaptic vesicle release and ion-channel function.

Together, these data suggest that peak-cluster 11 comprises enhancers orchestrating posterior CNS patterning and early neuronal differentiation in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 12

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 12 represents a set of regulatory regions that become progressively more accessible during segmentation, culminating in a sharp activation in the nervous system – in particular the enteric nervous system – by the 30-somite stage.

1. Spatiotemporal activity  
   • Accessibility is modest and fairly uniform (log2-signal ≈ 2.7–3.2) in most tissues at 0–15 somites, including neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) and presomitic mesoderm (PSM).  
   • From 20 somites onward the signal rises in neural derivatives (differentiating neurons, hind- and mid-brain, cranial neural crest, spinal cord, optic structures).  
   • The strongest jump is seen in enteric neurons at 30 somites (log2 ≈ 15.7), indicating a highly selective burst of chromatin opening in that lineage.

2. Gene neighbourhood  
   The peak set is located near >4000 genes that are strongly biased toward neuronal identity and function:  
   • Ion-channel and synaptic genes (GRIA/B, GRIN, KCN*, CACN*, SYT*, SNAP25, UNC13)  
   • Axon-guidance / adhesion genes (CNTN, ROBO, PLEXIN, SEMA)  
   • Neuro-specific transcription factors (NPAS3/4, NEUROD1/4/6, RUNX1/3, PRDM15, SOX4/11, PAX3/7, ZIC1-5).  
   • Several NFAT family members and many Ca2+-responsive genes, consistent with activity-dependent maturation of neurons.

3. Motif enrichment (row 12)  
   • Dominant motifs: NFAT family (Nfatc1/2/3/4, Nfat5) – classic Ca2+-responsive regulators of neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth.  
   • Secondary motifs: PAX6/PAX2 and other paired-homeodomain factors that pattern forebrain/eye and peripheral neurons.  
   • A sprinkling of E2F and MEF2 motifs suggests concurrent cell-cycle exit and activity-dependent gene programmes.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Cluster 12 likely delineates enhancers that are:  
   • Switched on broadly at low level as neuro-mesodermal progenitors exit the tail bud.  
   • Subsequently amplified in differentiating neurons, with peak activity in enteric neurons as they undergo late-stage maturation and network formation.  
   • Controlled by Ca2+/calcineurin-NFAT signalling and PAX-dependent patterning inputs, integrating electrical activity with tissue-specific identity cues.

In short, peak cluster 12 marks the NFAT/PAX-driven enhancer programme that drives late-somite neuronal – especially enteric neuronal – maturation in zebrafish embryos.
]

## Cluster 13

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 13 represents an axial–mesoderm / notochord‐specific regulatory module that is transiently switched on at the very beginning of segmentation.

1. Cell-type / stage specificity  
   • The pseudobulk signal is ~300 in “notochord 0 somites” but only ~12–14 in almost every other sample.  
   • Accessibility falls rapidly in notochord at 5–20 somites (16–15) and is only modest in tail-bud, early somite, floor-plate and neural midline samples, indicating an early, highly restricted burst of activity that fades as the embryo elongates.

2. Cis-linked genes  
   The peak set is attached to many classical notochord / axial mesoderm genes, e.g.  
   – ta (brachyury), noto, shhb, foxa/foxf family, tbx16, vcana, various collagens (col9a2, col15a1b, col12/14/28), extracellular-matrix and guidance genes (flrt2, fn1a, flt1) and early patterning regulators (multiple hox, dlx, barx, lhx, pax, msx, uncx).  
   These genes are characteristic of midline specification, anterior–posterior patterning and matrix remodelling performed by the notochord.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   Motifs with the strongest positive scores (|z| > 3) belong to:  
   • T-box (Brachyury/T), Fox (FoxA/FoxD/FoxF), Hox/ParaHox, Nkx, Pax, Msx, Lhx, Barx/Dlx families – all known drivers of notochord and trunk patterning.  
   • A sizeable E2F cluster hints at a concomitant burst of proliferation while the notochord rod is being formed.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Taken together, the data point to a set of enhancers that open exclusively in the nascent notochord shortly after gastrulation. They orchestrate expression of structural (collagens, ECM) and instructive (shhb, ta, hox) genes required for midline identity, signalling to adjacent tissues and subsequent axial elongation. Accessibility drops once the notochord matures, consistent with the transient nature of early notochord gene-regulatory programmes.

In short, peak-cluster 13 marks the early, high-intensity notochord enhancer landscape that drives formation and patterning of the zebrafish axial mesoderm during the 0–5-somite window.
]

## Cluster 14

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 14 corresponds to a set of regulatory regions that become progressively more open as development proceeds and that are most accessible in definitive endoderm–derived tissues (gut tube/endocrine pancreas) and, to a lesser extent, in metabolically active mesodermal derivatives such as heart myocardium and maturing somites.

1. Accessibility profile  
   • Very high signal in endoderm and endocrine-pancreas pseudobulks (log-counts ~12–24), rising steadily from the 0- to 30-somite stages.  
   • Secondary but consistent accessibility in heart, pharyngeal arches and late somites; only baseline signal in neural, epidermal or tail-bud samples.  
   • The pattern therefore tracks the appearance and maturation of trunk endoderm (fore-/mid-gut, hepatopancreatic domain) together with neighbouring lateral-plate/ cardiopharyngeal mesoderm.

2. Gene content  
   The peak list is strongly enriched for genes that drive or characterise endodermal organogenesis and lipid / sterol metabolism:  
   – Transcriptional regulators: gata4/5/6, hnf1ba/b, hnf4a/b/g, pdx1, onecut1/2/3, foxa1/a2, rfx6, nr1h4 (FXR), nr1h5, nr5a1/2, nr2f family, etc.  
   – Signalling / ECM genes associated with gut and pancreatic morphogenesis: fgf10/11/22, fgfr1/2, tnc, fn1b, multiple collagens (col12/14/17/18), adamts / adamtsl members, integrins (itga3/5/6, itgb1/5) and laminins (lamc1, lama1/2/5).  
   – Metabolic transporters and enzymes (slc10a2, slc27, slc2a family, abca/abcb/abcc members, cyp enzymes, apoa/apoc, srebf pathway components).  
   – Cardiovascular/mesodermal markers (hand2, gata5/6, vegfa/c, kdrl, flt4, tcf21, tnnt2a, myh6/7).

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   Cluster-14 peaks are highly enriched for bHLH-Zip and MiT/TFE-family motifs:  
   • circadian/metabolic regulators – BHLHE40/41 (DEC1/2), CLOCK/ARNTL (BMAL1), USF2, JDP2.  
   • MiT/TFE family – MITFa/b, TFEB, TFEC, TFE3a/b.  
   • Lipid/sterol regulators – SREBF1 and SREBF2.  
   • Oxidative-stress & redox sensors – BACH1/2.  
   Collectively these motifs point to a transcriptional network that links metabolic and circadian inputs to differentiation of secretory- and metabolism-oriented organs.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   The combination of (i) high, late accessibility in endoderm-derived organs, (ii) a gene roster rich in hepatopancreatic, intestinal and cardiovascular factors, and (iii) motifs for metabolic/circadian TFs suggests that peak-cluster 14 marks enhancer elements that coordinate maturation of gut-associated endoderm (including pancreas and liver anlagen) with adjacent cardiac/lateral-plate mesoderm, integrating environmental (nutrient, oxygen) and temporal cues.

In short, peak-cluster 14 represents a metabolic-/circadian-responsive enhancer programme that becomes active as the zebrafish trunk endoderm and cardiopharyngeal mesoderm differentiate, driving expression of genes required for organ morphogenesis, extracellular-matrix remodelling and lipid/sterol metabolism.

## Cluster 15

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15 marks a muscle-specific chromatin programme that switches on late in somitogenesis.

1. Cell-type/temporal profile  
   • Accessibility is already measurable in paraxial mesoderm/early somites but rises steadily and reaches a sharp maximum in differentiated muscle samples, especially the 30-somite “muscle” pseudobulk (≈ 48-fold above background) and in fast-muscle fractions (5–6 a.u.).  
   • Only moderate signal is seen in non-muscle lineages (neural, epidermis, endoderm, etc.).

2. Associated genes  
   Peaks sit next to many canonical skeletal-muscle structural and ECM genes as well as myogenic regulators, e.g.  
   ACTC1, ACTA1, MYOD1, MYF5, MYF6, MYOG, MEF2 family, TNNC2, TNNI1/2, TNNT1/3, MYH6/7, MYH10/14, TPM1/2/3, DMD, FLNC, CAV3, COL1A1/2, COL5A1/2, ITGA1/8, ADAM12, ADAMTS2/3/6, TNC, PDGFRA/B.  
   The list is also rich in metabolic and calcium-handling genes (RYR2, PIEZO2, CACNA2D1, SLC24A2) that typify mature myofibres.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   • Strong enrichment for the canonical myogenic bHLH network: MYOD, MYF5, MYF6, MYOG.  
   • Co-enrichment of MEF2, SRF/TCF, TEAD, TCF21 and nuclear-receptor motifs (PPAR, NR4A, ROR) that drive terminal differentiation and metabolic maturation.  
   • Additional FOX, SOX and HOX motifs probably reflect earlier mesodermal patterning states that precede full myogenic commitment.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   The peak set corresponds to the regulatory landscape of the differentiating zebrafish trunk/tail myotome—predominantly fast skeletal muscle—during the 15- to 30-somite window. It integrates earlier paraxial mesoderm patterning inputs with the late, muscle-terminal differentiation programme that builds sarcomeres, remodels the extracellular matrix and initiates fibre-type-specific metabolism.

In short, cluster 15 captures the chromatin and transcription-factor signature of late-somite skeletal-muscle differentiation in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 16

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 16 represents a set of regulatory regions that are most open very early in development and then progressively close.

1. Spatiotemporal accessibility  
   • The peaks are strongly accessible in 0- to 10-somite embryos in cell types that lie along the posterior body axis:  
     – neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) and early presomitic mesoderm (PSM)  
     – notochord (highest non-outlier signal; 7.1 at 0 s, falling steadily to 6.5 by 20 s)  
     – tail-bud mesoderm and early muscle lineages  
   • Accessibility drops sharply as the embryo matures (e.g. NMP 6.4 → 1.4 by 30 s), indicating that these elements are switched off once axial elongation slows.  
   • An extreme outlier signal is seen in primordial germ cells at the 0-somite stage (82), a reflection of their globally open chromatin rather than a lineage-specific peak signature.  
   • Most endodermal, epidermal and optic tissues show either baseline (~5–6) or no accessibility, confirming the axial bias of the cluster.

2. Gene content of the peaks  
   The associated gene list is enriched for:  
   • Hox, Uncx, Dlx, Lhx, Irx, Msx, Pbx/Meis – anterior-posterior patterning and axial skeletal specification.  
   • Forkhead (Fox), Sox, Pax and Nkx family genes – hallmark regulators of early neural tube, mesoderm and notochord identity.  
   • Guidance / adhesion genes (Robo1/2, Cntn, Cdh18, Tenm2, Sema family) – consistent with active cell migration and segmentation.  
   • Signalling components (Fgf8, Fgf24, Wnt6, Bmp modulators, Retinoic-acid receptors) – linking the peaks to canonical trunk-patterning pathways.  
   • Cell-cycle and chromatin modifiers (E2F, Kdm2, Kmt2, Dnmt1) – reflecting high proliferative activity of axial progenitors.

3. Motif and TF enrichment  
   Motifs for more than 100 TF classes are over-represented, but the dominant groups mirror the gene content:  
   • Hox, Pbx/Meis, Uncx – AP pattern specification.  
   • Forkhead (FoxA/C/D/F/K), Sox (B/C/E/F groups) – neuromesodermal and notochord programmes.  
   • Nkx1/2, Lhx1/2/4/9, Dlx, Irx, Msx – spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm regulators.  
   • Nuclear-receptor motifs for RAR/RXR, NR2F, PPAR – pointing to Retinoic-acid and lipid-signalling responsiveness.  
   • E2F, Kdm2, Mef2 – proliferation and early myogenic cues.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Together, the chromatin profile, gene inventory and motif landscape indicate that peak cluster 16 corresponds to “trunk/tail-bud axial progenitor enhancers.”  
   • They drive the early transcriptional programmes that establish posterior neural tube, notochord and paraxial mesoderm identities while embryos are still elongating.  
   • The strong RAR/RXR signature suggests that many of these elements are retinoic-acid responsive, fitting with the well-known role of RA in terminating axial extension.  
   • The gradual closure of the peaks after ~15 somites marks the transition from progenitor state to differentiated tissue and the slowing of body-axis growth.

In short, peak cluster 16 captures the early, retinoic-acid–sensitive enhancer repertoire of axial progenitors (NMP/PSM/notochord) that is shut down once trunk elongation is complete.
]

## Cluster 17

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 17 represents a set of cis-regulatory elements that are open in many lineages but are clearly most accessible in anterior neuro-ectodermal derivatives – in particular the early eye/forebrain field and differentiating neurons.

1. Pseudobulk accessibility  
   • Accessibility values are uniformly high (≈ 5.5–6 logCPM) in “neural”, “hindbrain”, “midbrain–hindbrain boundary”, “differentiating-neurons”, “optic cup”, “telencephalon” and “spinal-cord” samples at every somite stage, while purely mesodermal tissues (fast muscle, somites, lateral-plate) and late epidermis show much lower or even absent signal.  
   • The pattern therefore fits regulatory regions that switch on very early in the neural plate and remain accessible throughout neurogenesis but are largely silent in mesoderm/epidermis.

2. Associated genes  
   The nearest genes are heavily enriched for neuronal and forebrain/eye functions: ERBB4, NPAS3/4, LHX6, NRXN2, RIMS2, SYT2, GRIK2/3, LRRTM4, SEMA4F, TCF4, POU-class factors, many axon-guidance molecules (ROBO1/2, PLXNA1/2, EPH/EPHrin pairs) and dozens of synaptic vesicle components.  House-keeping genes are few, indicating genuine neural specificity rather than simple ubiquity.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • SIX homeobox factors (Six3/6/7, Six1/2/4/5/9) – canonical regulators of eye-field and anterior forebrain.  
   • DMRT family members (Dmrt1/2/3) – broadly required for neuronal subtype specification.  
   • Multiple FOX, PAX, LHX, DLX, IRX and SOX motifs – all typical of early neural-plate and telencephalic gene networks.  
   • Virtually no myogenic, endodermal or mesodermal motifs are over-represented.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Collectively, the chromatin, gene-proximity and motif data point to cluster 17 marking enhancers that drive the earliest waves of head neural-plate, eye-field and telencephalic transcription, and that stay open during maturation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.  These elements are essentially inactive in mesoderm-derived tissues, consistent with a role in establishing and maintaining neural identity rather than general cellular housekeeping.

Thus, peak-cluster 17 can be summarised as an “anterior neural / eye-field & pan-neural” regulatory module that is already active at the 0-somite stage, remains accessible throughout somitogenesis, and is controlled principally by SIX–DMRT–FOX/PAX/SOX transcription-factor circuitry.
]

## Cluster 18

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 18 captures a set of chromatin regions that behave like early–mid-somite-stage endodermal enhancers, with a particular bias toward the hatching-gland lineage.

1. Cell-type / stage specificity  
   • The pseudobulk ATAC signal is very high in the hatching-gland samples (≈ 45–53 a.u. at 0–15 somites, then falling to ≈ 12 a.u. by 30 somites).  
   • Strong but lower signal is also seen in other definitive endoderm derivatives – endocrine-pancreas (≈ 12–16 a.u.), generic endoderm (≈ 7–10 a.u.) and lateral-plate mesoderm.  
   • Neural, mesodermal or ectodermal compartments show only modest accessibility.  
   →  Together this suggests the peaks open earliest in the pre-chordal/endoderm field, peak while the hatching-gland is being specified (0–15 som), and close again as development proceeds.

2. Regulatory logic  
   • TF-motif enrichment for this cluster (row 18 of the motif table) is dominated by the GATA family (gata1/2/3/4/5/6) plus Trps1 – a hallmark signature of endodermal and glandular enhancers.  
   • No direct motifs are listed, implying the GATA factors act mainly through indirect or co-operative binding arrangements.

3. Associated genes  
   • The peak-to-gene links include numerous classical endoderm / gland genes (e.g. gata5/6, foxa3, hnf4a, pdx1, isl1, otx2, gsc, angptl1, sox17, agr2, col2a1a) as well as many digestive-organ and secretory-lineage genes.  
   • Presence of hatching-gland markers (e.g. he1.2, hgg enzymes) and pancreatic endocrine regulators (insra/b, isl1/2, neurod1) further supports the lineage assignment.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   Peak cluster 18 most likely represents a cohort of enhancers that are switched on in the early anterior endoderm, drive hatching-gland formation, and remain active in emerging pancreatic/endocrine tissue.  Their activity is orchestrated primarily by Gata4/5/6 (and co-factors such as Foxa and Hnf4), fitting the canonical zebrafish endoderm gene-regulatory network.

In short, cluster 18 marks GATA-driven, endoderm-specific regulatory elements that peak in accessibility during hatching-gland differentiation and early pancreatic/endoderm maturation between the 0- and 15-somite stages.
]

## Cluster 19

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 19 corresponds to a set of very broadly accessible DNA elements.

1. Chromatin-accessibility pattern  
   • The pseudobulk track shows relatively uniform, high accessibility (log₂ values ≈ 4–5) in almost every tissue and stage that was profiled.  
   • Accessibility drops only modestly in some late (30-somite) samples and is never truly silenced.  
   • The single conspicuous spike (≈ 37 in primordial-germ-cells at 10 somites) is typical of housekeeping promoters that are hyper-accessible in the germ line.  

2. Associated genes  
   • The peak list is extremely long and is dominated by “house-keeping” or multi-lineage genes (metabolic enzymes, cytoskeleton, vesicle traffic, ion transporters, etc.).  
   • Few, if any, lineage-restricted markers appear near the top of the list, reinforcing the idea that these peaks sit at promoters shared by many cell types.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   • The only strongly enriched motif family is GCM (represented by gcm2).  
   • In vertebrates the GCM consensus is GC-rich and is found in many constitutively open promoters; no clear, lineage-specific TF signatures are present.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Peak-cluster 19 most likely represents a “baseline/house-keeping” promoter set that remains open in virtually all embryonic cell types.  
   • The mild decline in accessibility in more differentiated 30-somite samples suggests that a subset of these promoters is down-regulated as cells mature, but they remain accessible enough for basal transcription.  
   • The GCM motif enrichment is consistent with GC-rich core-promoter architecture rather than a specialized developmental program.

In short, cluster 19 captures ubiquitously open, promoter-like chromatin that underpins fundamental, cell-wide gene expression rather than tissue-specific regulatory activity.
]

## Cluster 20

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 20 contains a set of chromatin regions that are open in almost every somitic cell population, but their accessibility is clearly stage- and tissue-biased.

1. Expression / accessibility profile  
   • Uniform, medium-high signal (≈ 4.5–5.5 a.u.) in most lineages at every somite stage.  
   • Marked early boost in posterior-neural territories (neural-posterior 0- & 10-somite stages: 14–15 a.u.).  
   • Dramatic late spike in the endocrine pancreas at 30-somites (64 a.u.), dwarfing every other sample.  
   → The peaks first open broadly, become especially accessible in posterior neuro-ectoderm, and are then maximally engaged when endocrine-pancreatic cells differentiate (~24 hpf).

2. Gene content (selected from >5,000 linked genes)  
   • Endoderm / pancreas: pdx1, gata4/5/6, hnf4a/g, hnf1bb, fgf7, tal1/2.  
   • Neuro-ectoderm: npas3, grm7, grin2a/b, lrf n2, pax6a/b, sox2/3/5.  
   • Axon guidance & adhesion: cdh18, ctnna2, robo1, unc5c, tenm2.  
   • House-keeping / metabolic promoters (kdm2b, ube2h, psmd4, etc.).  
   This mixed catalogue fits the “broadly open but later pancreas-biased” accessibility pattern.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • Strongest motif: KDM2B/CXXC (M05682, z-score ≈ 4) – typical for CpG-island promoters.  
   • Recurrent families: SOX, FOX, HOX/PBX, PAX, GATA, MEF2, nuclear receptors (RXR/RAR/PPAR).  
   • Additional lineage markers: PDX1, NKX2-, SIX, IRX, TBX, RUNX, E-box (MITF/TFEC).  
   Together they indicate promoter-rich elements that can be customised by multiple developmental TFs, with a late emphasis on pancreatic (PDX1, GATA, NKX) and metabolic nuclear-receptor inputs.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Peak cluster 20 largely comprises CpG-island promoters and neighbouring proximal enhancers that stay constitutively accessible from gastrulation through somitogenesis.  They are first utilised by posterior neural progenitors and then, more conspicuously, by differentiating endocrine-pancreatic cells.  The motif spectrum suggests these regions act as a transcriptional “landing pad” that different sets of lineage TFs (SOX/FOX early, PDX1/GATA/NKX later) can dock onto to drive tissue-specific gene expression.

In short, cluster 20 represents a housekeeping-promoter–rich compartment of the zebrafish genome that is broadly open, but reaches peak regulatory activity in the endocrine pancreas at the 30-somite stage while retaining moderate activity in neural and other embryonic tissues.
]

## Cluster 21

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 21 corresponds to the posterior axial/mesodermal programme that drives somitogenesis in the early zebrafish embryo.

1. Where the peaks are open  
   • The pseudobulk profile is highest in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), presomitic mesoderm (PSM), nascent somites and tail-bud (≈55-70 a.u. at 0–15 som stages).  
   • Accessibility falls steadily in the same tissues by the 30-somite stage and is low in endoderm, epidermis and most neural derivatives (<15 a.u.), indicating a lineage-restricted, developmental­-stage-restricted pattern.

2. Genes that lie under the peaks  
   The cluster is packed with canonical paraxial-mesoderm / segmentation genes:  
   • Core axial regulators – tbxta/tbxtb (Brachyury), tbx6 / tbx16 / tbx6l, msgn1, cdx1a/4, ripply1/2, her1/her7, eomesa.  
   • Somite boundary genes – mespab/mespaa, pax3/7, lbx1/2, meox1/2, uncx4.1, foxc1/2, lbx1, tbx15/18.  
   • Posterior patterning factors – an extensive HoxA/B/C/D repertoire (hoxb1-hoxb10, hoxa9, hoxc6/8/9/10/11/12/13, hoxd3/4/9/10/11/12, etc.).  
   • Signalling components of the FGF, Wnt, Notch and retinoic-acid pathways (fgf8a, fgf24, wnt3a/8a/5b, dll/hes/her genes, cyp26a1).  
   • Early myogenic and extracellular-matrix genes (myf5, myod1, myog, acta1a, col11a1/col1a1, fn1a/b).

3. Transcription-factor motif enrichment  
   Motif analysis recovers almost every TF family known to regulate trunk and tail development:  
   • T-box (TBX/T/Brachyury), Cdx, and TEAD (Hippo) motifs that drive axial elongation.  
   • Large blocks of Hox/homeobox, Lbx, Msx, Uncx and Meis/Pbx motifs – the classic Hox–Meis–Pbx code for A–P identity.  
   • Fox and Sox family motifs (including FoxC/F/L and Sox5/6/9/10/11/17/19) that couple mesoderm identity to epithelial–mesenchymal transitions.  
   • Pax3/7 and Runx/Ets binding sites linked to early myogenic and vascular fates.  
   • E2F and cell-cycle motifs, consistent with the very proliferative nature of NMPs and PSM.  
   • Moderate enrichment for nuclear-receptor (COUP-TF/Nr2f, RAR/RXR) motifs, matching the RA gradient that positions somite boundaries.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Taken together, peak-cluster 21 captures the chromatin landscape of the posterior growth zone that gives rise to paraxial mesoderm and nascent somites. The peaks are most accessible while cells are still proliferative NMPs/PSM, close as somites mature, and are largely silent in neural, endodermal or later muscle derivatives. The associated genes and motifs show that this cluster integrates segmentation-clock inputs (Her/Notch), posteriorising signals (Wnt/FGF/Cdx), RA-mediated anterior restriction, and the Hox code to coordinate axial extension, somite segmentation and the onset of myogenesis.
]

## Cluster 22

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 22 corresponds to a very broad set of regulatory elements that are open in many different somitic-stage cell types, but they become most accessible in surface ectoderm/epidermis (especially by the 20–30-somite stages) and, to a lesser extent, in maturing muscle and several neural derivatives.  
• Pseudobulk profile – accessibility sits around basal levels (log-CPM ≈ 6–7) in almost every lineage, but rises further in epidermis (≥ 8; the 94 value is an obvious outlier caused by a single extreme peak) and shows moderate bumps in late muscle, mid-/hind-brain boundary, and enteric-neuronal samples.  
• Linked genes – more than a thousand widely expressed loci encoding extracellular-matrix components (many collagens, fibronectin-1, laminins), cytoskeletal/adhesion proteins (ACTN, ITGA/ITGB family, cadherins, integrins), general signalling receptors (FGF, Wnt, BMP, RA, VEGF pathways) and housekeeping regulators (chromatin remodellers, RNA-processing factors).  This repertoire is consistent with genes that all tissues need but that epidermis and mesodermal derivatives up-regulate during morphogenesis and differentiation.  
• Motif enrichment – the dominant motifs are for TALE/HOX cofactors (PBX / MEIS / PKNOX), nuclear hormone-receptor families (RAR/RXR, COUP-TF/NR2F, ROR, PPAR), AP-1 components (FOS, JUN, JDP2), NRF/NFE2L oxidative-stress factors and some ETS factors.  Together these point to retinoic-acid responsiveness, trunk patterning inputs and generic stress- / growth-control pathways, which again fits epidermis and maturing mesoderm.  

In short, cluster 22 seems to represent a “core morphogenetic/RA-responsive” chromatin program that is accessible across most embryonic tissues but is maximally engaged in late epidermis and in mesoderm-derived muscle, supporting extracellular-matrix production, cell adhesion and retinoic-acid driven patterning during mid- to late-somitogenesis in zebrafish.
]

## Cluster 23

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 23 corresponds to a set of chromatin regions that are open almost everywhere and at every embryonic stage we examined.

1. Accessibility profile  
   • The pseudobulk signal is high (≈ 280–450 normalized counts) in all cell types, from 0- to 30-somite stages, and rises slightly at the later stages.  
   • No lineage shows a dramatic gain or loss, indicating that these peaks are constitutively accessible rather than lineage-restricted enhancers.

2. Genes found in the cluster  
   • The list is heavily enriched for genes with “house-keeping” or core cellular functions (ribosomal proteins, RNA-processing factors, metabolic enzymes, cell-cycle regulators).  
   • It also contains many ubiquitous or early developmental transcription factors (e.g. pax5/6/8, hnf4a/g, ctcf, tbp, lin28, e2f family, sox/fox/kdm/znf genes).  
   • Such a composition is typical of proximal promoter regions of genes that must stay transcriptionally competent in most cells.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • The most over-represented motifs are for Pax family members (pax2a, pax5, pax6a/b, pax8, pax1a/b) and the endodermal nuclear receptors HNF4A and HNF4G.  
   • General promoter/basal-transcription motifs are also present (TBP, LIN54, SSRP1, TOX4).  
   • Together these motifs suggest that, although the peaks are broadly open, they are poised to integrate tissue-specific inputs from Pax factors (neural tube, sensory placodes, pronephros) and HNF4 factors (liver/intestine, pancreas).

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster 23 most likely represents constitutively open promoter regions of widely expressed genes—“house-keeping” plus a cadre of early patterning transcription factors.  
   • Their continual accessibility provides a basal transcriptional platform that can be modulated by Pax and HNF4 proteins as the embryo apportions neural and endodermal fates.  
   • In other words, this cluster marks the genomic “common ground” on which lineage-specific programmes are later super-imposed.

In summary, peak cluster 23 is best viewed as a promoter-rich, ubiquitously accessible chromatin compartment that underlies general cellular functions while retaining regulatory hooks (Pax and HNF-type motifs) for neural and endodermal patterning during zebrafish somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 24

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24 represents a set of chromatin regions that are open essentially everywhere in the embryo, i.e. they behave like classical housekeeping promoters.

1. Accessibility pattern  
• In almost every pseudobulk sample – from the earliest neuromesodermal progenitors to differentiated tissues – the signal sits in the narrow 3.4-to-4.2 log-CPM range, indicating constitutive accessibility.  
• The only noticeable excursion is a strong spike in late hatching-gland cells (≈45 log-CPM at 30 somites), suggesting that this tissue transiently amplifies the basal transcriptional programme when it begins secreting chorion-lytic enzymes just before hatching.

2. Gene content  
The peak set lies next to several thousand genes, the great majority of which encode:  
• Core metabolic enzymes (e.g. ACACA, GAPDH-family, FASN, CPT1, many mitochondrial genes)  
• Generic structural/trafficking proteins (actins, tubulins, clathrin, etc.)  
• Cell-cycle and DNA-replication factors (cdc-, mcm-, e2f-, smc-genes)  
• Broadly expressed transcription factors (E2F family, MYC network, FOXK/FOXO, PAX, TBX, MEIS, etc.).  
Such a gene spectrum is typical for promoters that must remain accessible in every cell to sustain basal cellular functions.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
Cluster 24 is not enriched for lineage-restricted motifs but for components of the general transcriptional machinery and cell-cycle checkpoints:  
• LIN54 (DREAM/MuvB complex that gates S-phase genes)  
• TBP / TBPL2 (core TATA-binding factors)  
• SSRP1 (FACT chromatin-remodelling complex)  
• POU2F1 (Oct-1; ubiquitous RNA-pol II initiator)  
• TOX4 (PTW/PP1 transcriptional regulator)  
These motifs reinforce the idea that the peaks are promoter-proximal and used broadly rather than in a lineage-specific manner.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, peak-cluster 24 marks the constitutively open promoters of housekeeping and cell-cycle genes that all cells need for growth, metabolism and division. Their accessibility is largely uniform across lineages and developmental time, with a temporary boost in the hatching-gland at the end of somitogenesis, when that tissue experiences a surge of transcriptional activity in preparation for hatching.
]

## Cluster 25

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 25 contains a set of chromatin peaks that become highly accessible as soon as the haemato-vascular lineage is specified and remain open throughout segmentation stages.

1. Cell-type / stage profile  
   • Accessibility is negligible in early progenitors (tail-bud, NMP, PSM) but rises steeply from the 5-somite stage onwards in  
     – haemangioblasts and “haematopoietic/vascular” endothelium (highest signal; 20- to 40-fold above baseline)  
     – nascent myocardium and endoderm–derived endocrine pancreas (moderate signal)  
   • Most neural, epidermal, muscle or notochord samples show only background accessibility.  
   ⇒ The peaks therefore mark regulatory DNA that is used predominantly by the emerging endothelial / blood progenitor compartment.

2. Gene neighbourhood  
   Peaks are positioned next to canonical endothelial and early blood regulators, e.g. kdrl/vegfr2, kdr, flt1, flt4, tie1, tek, vegfc, etv2, fli1a/b, erg, tal1, gata2, runx1, spi1, notch1a/b, sox7/17/18 and many vascular effectors (pecam1, esama, vwf, stab1/2, rorb, cldn5b).  The gene set matches the molecular signature of haemangioblasts transitioning to endothelial and haematopoietic fates.

3. Motif enrichment (TF network)  
   • ETS sites (Etv2, Fli1, Erg, Ets1/2) – core drivers of endothelial identity  
   • GATA / TAL / Runx sites – required for blood specification downstream of Etv2  
   • Forkhead (FoxC1/2, FoxF, FoxO) and SOX7/17/18 motifs – cooperate with ETS factors in vascular enhancers  
   • Homeobox/Hox and Pax motifs – reflect rostro-caudal patterning of endothelial beds and contribution of Lbx/Lhx/Pax factors to vasculature of specific segments.  

4. Developmental interpretation  
   Cluster 25 represents a haemangioblast / endothelial enhancer module that switches on shortly after gastrulation, drives the initial wave of vasculogenesis and is maintained as endothelial cells mature and segregate into arterial-venous and haematopoietic programmes.

In short, peak-cluster 25 captures the regulatory landscape of zebrafish haemangioblasts and nascent vascular endothelium during the 5- to 30-somite window, linking classic endothelium-specific genes with the expected ETS–GATA–Forkhead transcription-factor network.

## Cluster 26

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 26 is characterised by a very strong enrichment for motifs of the nuclear-receptor super-family.  The over-represented factors include the complete retinoic-acid receptor module (RAR α/β/γ together with their obligatory RXR partners), RORs, the COUP-TF/NR2F family, PPARs, thyroid-hormone receptors, vitamin-D receptor, oestrogen receptors and the NR5A/NR1H sub-groups.  Correspondingly, many of these receptors – together with the genes that make, degrade or transport their ligands (e.g. aldh1a2, rdh10a, cyp26a1/b1, crabp2a/b, ppar α/β/γ, vdr, rxr, thr) – sit in the gene list linked to the peaks.  Classic retinoic-acid target genes such as numerous Hox genes, as well as additional endocrine / metabolic regulators (e.g. gata-, fox- and cyp- family members) are also present.

Taken together, cluster 26 therefore represents a set of hormone-responsive enhancers that integrate retinoic-acid, lipid/sterol and other nuclear-receptor signals.  In the embryo these elements are typically active in posterior neuro-ectoderm, paraxial mesoderm and emerging endoderm-derived organs such as liver and pancreas, where RA and lipid-derived cues pattern the trunk and drive metabolic differentiation.

## Cluster 27

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 27 corresponds to a set of regulatory elements that are most accessible in posterior mesoderm derivatives and, later, in differentiating skeletal muscle.

1. Pseudobulk accessibility pattern  
   • Very high signal in the tail-bud at 0 somites (38.5) and in bulk “muscle” at 30 somites (49.2), with a clear enrichment in fast-muscle cells at the same stage (6.1).  
   • Moderate accessibility (≈4.5–5.5) in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and early somites (0-20 somites), but a precipitous drop in somites and NMPs by 30 somites (≤1).  
   • Low or absent signal in epidermis, neural, endodermal and floor-plate samples at late stages.  
   → This temporal profile fits elements that switch on in tail-bud/segmenting mesoderm and stay open only in the myogenic lineage as differentiation proceeds.

2. Associated genes (selected highlights)  
   – Myogenic/contractile: myog, mef2aa/ab/cb, myf5, tnnt3a, casq1a, tpm4b, acta1-like genes.  
   – Posterior patterning & segmentation: many posterior HOX (hoxb4-b10, hoxc8-c13, hoxa9-a13), tbx, uncx, lbx, pax3/7.  
   – ECM / adhesion typical of developing muscle and tendon: col5a1, col11a1a, tnc, mmp2/mmp14a, fbn2, integrin-associated genes.  
   – Signalling / growth: fgf11a/13a, igf1rb, igfbp2a, vegfba, ror family, pparda/pparg.  

3. Motif enrichment  
   The strongest positive motif scores belong to:  
   • HOX/PRD homeobox family (posterior axial identity).  
   • MEF2/SRF family – central to myogenic differentiation.  
   • FOX factors (FoxC/F/L/FoxK) – active in paraxial mesoderm and muscle progenitors.  
   • Nuclear receptors of the COUP-TF/PPAR/RAR families – consistent with retinoic-acid and lipid signalling in somitogenesis and myogenesis.  
   • SOX, TBX/PAX and E-box (bHLH) classes appear in the broader enriched list, again matching mesodermal and myogenic programs.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Cluster 27 captures enhancers that are first engaged in the posterior growth zone (tail-bud) and segmenting mesoderm, then become restricted to fast-muscle fibres as somitic cells terminally differentiate. The gene content and motif landscape point to coordinated control by HOX positional cues, FOX/SOX mesoderm factors and the classic myogenic regulators MEF2 and bHLH proteins, with additional modulation by nuclear-receptor signalling. In short, this cluster represents the regulatory architecture underlying the transition from tail-bud progenitors to mature trunk/tail skeletal muscle.
]

## Cluster 28

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 28 corresponds to a regulatory module that is almost exclusively active in neural-crest–derived and early neuronal lineages during the 10–30-somite period.

1. Cell-type specificity  
   • Pseudobulk accessibility rises sharply in “differentiating _neurons”, “enteric _neurons”, “spinal-cord/neural” and “tail-bud” samples, whereas mesodermal, endodermal and epidermal compartments remain at basal levels.  
   • Activity increases with developmental time, peaking in 20–30-somite embryos, a stage at which migrating neural-crest cells are committing to peripheral-neuronal fates (e.g. enteric, sympathetic and sensory lineages).

2. Gene content of the locus set  
   The linked genes are heavily enriched for neuronal and neural-crest functions.  Examples include  
   • Axon guidance / synapse formation: ERBB4, NPAS3, NRXN2, CNTNAP2, LRRTM4, ROBO1/3, RIMS1/2, TENM2, TCF4, CACNA2D1/3, GRIN2B, GRIK2/3, GABRB2.  
   • Neural-crest identity & migration: SOX10, FOXD3, TFAP2, RET, PHOX2B, PAX3/7, ZEB2, SNAI family, HAND2.  
   • Adhesion / ECM remodelling genes (PCDH clusters, ADAMTSs, COLs) that facilitate crest cell delamination and path-finding.

3. Transcription-factor motif landscape  
   Cluster-28 peaks are enriched for HLH and EMT-associated motifs rather than a single dominant “direct” motif:  
   • TCF12/E-proteins and HAND2 – drivers of neurogenic and mesenchymal differentiation.  
   • SNAI1/2/3 and ZEB1/2 – classical EMT regulators necessary for neural-crest emigration.  
   • MESPA/B and NH­LH2 – factors linked to early neurogenesis.  
   This motif spectrum matches the mixed migratory (EMT) and neurogenic character of crest-derived neurons.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Taken together, the expression profile, gene composition and motif enrichment indicate that peak-cluster 28 marks enhancers that become accessible when neural-crest cells exit the dorsal neural tube, undergo EMT, and begin to differentiate into peripheral/enteric neurons.  The cluster therefore captures the transcriptional switch that couples crest cell migration with the onset of neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 29

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29 represents a regulatory module that becomes strongly and selectively accessible in the posterior growth zone of the embryo.

1. Spatiotemporal accessibility  
   • Accessibility is low and fairly uniform in most tissues (log2 CPM ≈ 4–5).  
   • It rises modestly in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) by 20 somites and then explodes at 30 somites (log2 ≈ 64).  
   • The same late, high accessibility is seen in the tail-bud sample (log2 ≈ 71) and, to a lesser degree, in the 30-somite presomitic mesoderm (PSM).  
   • Other tissues, including neural, endodermal and optic derivatives, remain at background levels.  
   ➜  The peak set therefore marks the caudal progenitor/tail-bud territory during the cessation of body-axis extension.

2. Gene content  
   The peaks are linked to many canonical posterior-mesoderm and axis-extension genes, e.g.  
   – axial regulators: tbxta, msgn1, tbx6, cdx1a/4, wnt3/3a/5b, fgf19, fgf18, axin2  
   – segmentation genes: mespaa/mespab, ripply, notch1a, her/hes family  
   – EMT / motility factors: snai1a/2, zeb1a/1b, vimentin, loxl, integrins  
   – tail-bud metabolic and cell-cycle genes (e.g. ldhb, myc targets) reflecting the high proliferative state.  

3. Motif enrichment (row 29)  
   • E-protein bHLH sites (TCF3/12) – generic competence factors for mesodermal and neuro-mesodermal programs.  
   • ZEB and SNAI family motifs – hallmarks of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition required for tail-bud cell motility.  
   • HAND2 and MESP sites – associated with lateral-plate / paraxial mesoderm differentiation and somite boundary formation.  
   • Additional enrichment for PRRX and TCF factors supports posterior mesoderm identity.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Peak-cluster 29 captures the chromatin signature of late NMP/tail-bud cells as they switch from a multipotent state to committed mesodermal fates and undergo EMT-driven axial elongation.  The associated genes and transcription-factor motifs indicate active Wnt–Cdx–Tbx circuitry, segmentation enhancers (Mesp), and EMT regulators (Snail/Zeb/Hand), all of which are essential for continued body-axis extension and somite formation in zebrafish.

In short, cluster 29 defines a posterior body-extension enhancer set that turns on at the end of somitogenesis, driving the genetic programme that converts caudal progenitors into elongating paraxial mesoderm.
]

## Cluster 30

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 30 corresponds to a set of regulatory regions that stay weakly accessible in most tissues (≈ log2 accessibility 2–4) but “switch on” very strongly in two situations:

1. Posterior presomitic / somitic mesoderm at the late-segmentation stages (PSM 20 somites ≈ 8, enteric_neurons 30 somites ≈ 31).  
2. Neural-crest–derived enteric neurons just after they start to differentiate (enteric_neurons 30 somites).

Gene content.  
The associated genes are heavily biased toward  
• posterior patterning and mesodermal morphogenesis (hundreds of Hox, Pbx/Meis, Tbx, Mesp, Cdx, Uncx, etc.),  
• neural-crest migration / axon guidance / synaptic assembly (Sox10, Sox11, Sox21, Dlx, Lhx, Nkx, Pax3/7, Ret-/Nrg-/Nrx-/Grin-family receptors, many ion-channel and adhesion genes),  
• ECM-remodelling enzymes (Adam, Adamts, Mmp, Col families).

Motif enrichment.  
The over-represented motifs fall into four broad groups that fit this expression profile:  
• HOX / PBX / MEIS – posterior axial identity.  
• SOX, DLX, PAX, LHX, NKX – neural-crest and neuronal differentiation.  
• FOXA/FOXF/FOXO/FOXM & GATA – endoderm-mesoderm signalling and EMT.  
• RAR/RXR, ROR, PPAR, NR family – retinoic-acid and metabolic nuclear-receptor response.  
Smaller peaks for E2F and MYC modules point to cells that are still proliferating when these enhancers open.

Interpretation.  
Cluster 30 marks enhancers that are silent or low in early multipotent progenitors but become highly accessible as:

• posterior presomitic mesoderm matures into somites, and  
• vagal neural-crest cells settle in the gut and commit to the enteric-neuronal lineage.

Thus the cluster captures a posterior patterning / neuro-mesodermal transcriptional programme that integrates HOX positional cues with neural-crest-specific SOX/DLX/PAX inputs and retinoic-acid signalling to drive the emergence of late somitic tissue and enteric neurons.
]

## Cluster 31

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 31 represents a set of regulatory regions that become markedly more accessible in the posterior body of the embryo as somitogenesis proceeds.

1. Spatiotemporal activity  
   • Accessibility is low-to-moderate (log2 CPM ≈ 5-7) in most tissues and stages, but rises dramatically at:  
     – Newly forming neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs) at the 30-somite stage (≈ 56)  
     – Tail-bud tissue at the 30-somite stage (≈ 68)  
     – Mature somites (30 ss) and posterior presomitic mesoderm (PSM 30 ss)  
     – A transient burst in the floor-plate at the 0-somite stage (≈ 28)  
   This pattern is typical of chromatin that is progressively activated in posterior axial progenitors and their derivatives during the final phase of body-axis elongation.

2. Gene content  
   The associated gene list is enriched for:  
   • Posterior Hox and other patterning genes (many HoxB/C/D members, Uncx, Meox, Cdx, Lbx, Lhx, etc.)  
   • Retinoic-acid and other nuclear-receptor targets (Rara/b/g, Rxr, Rorb, Nr2f/4a/5a families)  
   • Axial-progenitor / growth regulators (Lin28a, Hmga2, Fgf18b, Wnt and BMP modulators)  
   • Extracellular-matrix and mesodermal-morphogenesis genes (Col, Adamts, Plxn, Pdgfra group)

3. Motif/TF signature  
   The dominant motif enrichment (row 31) is for nuclear-receptor half-sites and DR-type repeats that are recognised by retinoic-acid receptors (RARs), RXRs, RORs, NR2F/COUP-TFs and NR5A.  This, together with numerous indirect hits for the same receptors, points to retinoic-acid signalling—and, more broadly, NR-mediated transcription—as the key upstream driver of this cluster.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Taken together, the data indicate that peak-cluster 31 corresponds to a retinoic-acid–responsive regulatory programme that switches on in late NMPs/tail-bud cells and remains active in newly formed posterior somites.  The module likely orchestrates posterior Hox gene activation, axial termination, and the mesoderm-to-neural transcriptional transition characteristic of the end of body-axis extension in zebrafish.

In short, cluster 31 marks a set of RA-sensitive enhancers that dominate posterior axial progenitors at the end of somitogenesis, coordinating Hox patterning and differentiation of tail-bud-derived tissues.
]

## Cluster 32

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 32 marks a set of cis-regulatory regions that stay fairly quiet throughout most tissues but “switch on’’ spectacularly in the optic-cup lineage: accessibility climbs gradually during somitogenesis and explodes at the 30-somite stage in optic-cup/retinal cells (≈100-fold higher than the background, while all other lineages remain around baseline).  

Motif landscape  
• Strong, selective enrichment for half-site nuclear-receptor motifs (RAR, RXR, ROR, COUP-TF/NR2F, REV-ERB/NR1D, PPAR, ESRR, VDR).  
• Very little contribution from canonical neuronal, mesodermal or endodermal TF families, indicating a specialised regulatory programme rather than a broad neural signature.

Candidate regulators and nearby genes  
The same nuclear-receptor cohort that dominates the motif analysis is found in the gene list located near the peaks: rarga / rargb, rxraa / rxrab / rxrgb, rorb / rorcb, nr2f1/2/5/6, nr1d1/2/4, esrra/-ga/-gb, vdrb, pparaa/-ab/-da/-g, etc.  Many of these factors—and their metabolic/retinoid-handling targets such as rdh8, rlbp1-like genes, abca4, rgra—are known drivers of retinal and photoreceptor differentiation and of the metabolic rewiring that accompanies it.

Biological implication  
The data point to a late-somitogenesis retinal programme in which retinoic-acid, lipid- and circadian-responsive nuclear receptors orchestrate the final maturation of the optic cup.  Cluster 32 therefore represents retina-specific enhancers that are activated late (≈24 hpf) to couple retinoid signalling and metabolic control with photoreceptor/optic-cup differentiation.
]

## Cluster 33

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 33 corresponds to a set of very broadly accessible regulatory elements that are most open in neural derivatives throughout somitogenesis and that carry a clear “Pax / early-patterning” signature.

1. Chromatin accessibility pattern  
   • Pseudobulk values are high (≈ 22–27 log₂ counts) in almost every lineage, but peak in neuro-ectodermal samples (differentiating neurons, spinal cord, hind-/mid-brain, optic cup, neural crest).  
   • Accessibility is already maximal at the 0–5-somite stages and only modestly declines by 30 somites, suggesting these enhancers act early and stay active during tissue patterning.

2. Gene set linked to the peaks  
   • Contains many archetypal regional-patterning transcription factors: pax1/2/3/5/6/8, otx1/2/5, rx1/2/3, vsx1, barhl1/2, vax1/2, gbx1/2, uncx, lmx, lhx, dlx, six, irrx, nkx, msx and extensive anterior-posterior Hox coverage (hoxa1-13, hoxb1-10, hoxc1-13, hoxd3-12).  
   • Also includes genes typical of pronephric/otic programmes (e.g. pax2a/b, pax8, hnf1b, slc12a family) and early sensory placode/retina genes (e.g. sox2/3, vsx1, crx), consistent with the tissues that show the highest accessibility.

3. Motif enrichment (row 33)  
   • Strongest signal for Pax family motifs (Pax2/5/6 cluster) together with Sox, Fox, Lhx/Dlx/Barhl, Otx, Vax and a dense assortment of Hox sites – a classic combination for neural-tube, cranial-placode and kidney/ear enhancers.  
   • Absence of mesoderm-specific or late neuronal subtype motifs reinforces the idea that these peaks mark early, multipotent patterning enhancers rather than late differentiation elements.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster 33 most likely represents an atlas of early patterning enhancers used by Pax-controlled gene networks that regionalise the anterior neural plate/tube and specify adjoining placodal and intermediate mesodermal tissues (otic placode, pronephros).  
   • Their sustained but gradually tapering accessibility suggests that after establishing positional identity, these elements remain open to allow subsequent lineage-specific factors (e.g. Hox, Lhx, Sox) to refine neuronal, sensory-organ and kidney programmes.

In short, peak-cluster 33 is a Pax-centric, early-patterning chromatin module that underlies broad neuro-ectodermal, placodal and intermediate-mesoderm gene expression during zebrafish somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 34

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 34 corresponds to chromatin regions that are turned on mainly in neural–crest–derived lineages during mid- to late somitogenesis.

1. Temporal / spatial accessibility  
   • Highest accessibility is seen in neural-crest populations, peaking between 10- and 20-somite stages (≈40–43 AU) and remaining high at 30 somites (≈31 AU).  
   • A secondary, more modest signal is present in early notochord (5–10 somites ≈17 AU) and in early enteric-neural crest / neurons (≈9–10 AU).  
   • Most other tissues (PSM, endoderm, mesoderm, brain, epidermis, tail-bud, etc.) show only basal values (≈5–7 AU).

2. Gene content of the peaks  
   The nearest genes form a classic neural-crest / melanocyte signature: sox10, sox9, sox8, pax3a/b, pax7, foxd3, foxf2, foxi1/3, snai1/2, zeb2, mitfa, tyr, dct (pigment pathway), tfap2 family, lef1, notch1b, erbb3b, ngfrb, pdgfra, fgf13a, tenm2, plxna3, robo1, integrins (itga8/9, itgb1a, itgb8), collagen/ECM genes (col16a1, col18a1, loxl1/2), guidance and adhesion molecules (cntn2/5, cadm1a, chd7, epha4b).  These genes are needed for neural-crest delamination, migration and early differentiation (especially melanocyte and peripheral-neuronal fates).

3. Transcription-factor motif enrichment  
   The most over-represented motifs (z-scores ≳ 2) map to:  
   • MITF / TFE family (M09755) – master regulator of melanocyte specification.  
   • SOX (SOX10/5/9/2/3/21), FOX (FOXD3, FOXF2, FOXC1, FOXP family) and PAX3/7 motifs – core neural-crest GRN drivers.  
   • TFAP2, LEF/TCF, E2F, BACH/MAF, MEF2 and bHLH (NeuroD/ATOH/OLIG) motifs, supporting roles in proliferation, EMT and lineage restriction.  
   • AP-1 / CREB and BATF–JUN motifs, consistent with high migratory and signalling activity.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Together, the accessibility pattern, gene roster and motif landscape indicate that peak-cluster 34 marks regulatory elements active in trunk neural-crest cells once they leave the dorsal neural tube, migrate through the somites and begin to differentiate—particularly towards pigment (melanocyte) and peripheral-neuronal/enteric lineages.  The transient accessibility in the notochord may reflect shared dorsal midline enhancers used early in development.

In short, peak-cluster 34 captures the chromatin programme of migratory neural-crest cells and their early derivatives during the 5- to 30-somite window, driven by SOX–FOX–PAX-MITF centred regulatory networks.
]

## Cluster 35

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 35 represents a group of chromatin regions that are open very early in segmentation-stage embryos and whose accessibility is largely controlled by SOX-family transcription factors.

1. Motif/TF signature  
   • Strong, specific enrichment for SOX binding sites (Sox2/3/10/11/14/19, Sox4/5/6/8/9, Sox17/18/21, etc.).  
   • Minor co-enrichment for CUX homeoproteins and the HBP1 HMG-box factor.  
   → Implies that the regions are part of a SOX-centred regulatory programme typical of pluripotent ectodermal / neural-plate / neural-crest progenitors.

2. Pseudobulk accessibility pattern (ATAC-signal)  
   • Highest signal at the 0–15-somite stages in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP), presomitic mesoderm (PSM), forming somites, early muscle and diverse neural populations.  
   • Accessibility remains moderate in many tissues through 20 somites but drops sharply by the 30-somite stage in NMP, epidermis and some late neural derivatives, indicating a transient, early function.  
   • Very low signal in mature epidermis and late pancreas / optic tissues, suggesting these peaks are not part of terminal-differentiation programmes.

3. Gene content linked to the peaks  
   • Thousands of genes with over-representation of:  
     – Developmental regulators and signalling molecules (FOXL2, NPAS3, FGFs/FGFRs, ERBB4, AXL, WNT, NOTCH components).  
     – Cell-adhesion / ECM genes (numerous collagens, ADAM/ADAMTS, SEMA/PLXN, cadherins).  
     – Broad metabolic and cytoskeletal genes typical of proliferative progenitors.  
   • The breadth of the list and its functional diversity fit with enhancers that drive widespread early progenitor expression rather than tight lineage restriction.

4. Biological interpretation  
Peak-cluster 35 marks an early, SOX-driven enhancer set that is active across multipotent ectodermal and paraxial-mesodermal progenitors during the first 10-15 somites. These elements likely mediate the initial establishment of neural-plate, neural-crest and paraxial-mesoderm gene programmes and are progressively decommissioned as cells commit to more specialised fates later in segmentation.
]

## Cluster 0

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 0 captures a very neuronal – and temporally regulated – chromatin programme.

1. Where and when the peaks open  
   • Accessibility is basal in early neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP) and presomitic mesoderm (values ~1.4 – 1.7).  
   • Beginning at ~5–10 somites it rises steeply in “differentiating neurons” and reaches its maximum between 15 and 30 somites (log-counts 9–14).  
   • The same pattern is seen in enteric neurons (5.8 → 16) and, to a lesser extent, in floor-plate / spinal cord / hind-brain samples, while non-neural tissues stay at baseline.  
   → The cluster therefore marks enhancers that switch on as neural progenitors exit the cell cycle and mature, and it remains active in both central and peripheral/enteric neurons.

2. Genes linked to the peaks (~200)  
   They are overwhelmingly neuronal or neuro-endocrine:  
   • Axon guidance / adhesion: UNC5C, TENM2, CNTN3/5, CNTNAP2/5, SDK1, NRXN2/3, NCAM1, NTM, DSCAML1.  
   • Synaptic vesicle / neurotransmission: SNAP25b, SYT1a, SV2B/C, CPLX2, SYN1, GRIA3, GRID2, GRIN2B, GABRB4.  
   • Ion channels & excitability: CACNA1B/2D3/2D4, KCNJ3, KCNH5, KCNK10, SCN3B, TRPM5, RYR3.  
   • Neuro-specific regulators: RBFOX1/3, TRIM67, NFIX (a/b), MAGI3, TBR1-like POU6F2, PRKG1, EML5, etc.  
   • A few neuro-endocrine/β-cell genes (ABCC8, CHGA, CPE) are present, consistent with the shared neuro-secretory signature.

3. Transcription-factor motif enrichment  
   The strongest positive motif z-scores (e.g. M04174, M03539, M04665) correspond to:  
   • Neurogenic bHLH factors (ATOH/NEUROD family, OLIG/TCF12).  
   • Homeobox regulators of neuronal subtype identity (LHX, PBX/PKNOX, HOX, TLX).  
   • SOX and FOX family motifs that act earlier in neural lineage priming.  
   • CREB/ATF and AP-1 (JUN/FOS/BATF) motifs linked to activity-dependent maturation.  
   • Minor enrichment for NEF-E/NR nuclear-receptors (RORA/RXRs) that modulate neuronal metabolism.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Peak cluster 0 represents a set of enhancers that become accessible as progenitors commit to neuronal fates and remain active through maturation of both CNS and PNS neurons (especially enteric and cranial/hind-brain lineages).  The associated genes equip cells for neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis and neurotransmission, while the enriched motifs point to a regulatory network governed by SOX/FOX priming factors, neurogenic bHLH drivers and subtype-specific homeobox genes.

In short, cluster 0 defines the “neuronal differentiation / maturation” enhancer repertoire that turns on after the 5-somite stage and dominates chromatin accessibility in developing zebrafish neurons.
]

## Cluster 1

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 1 is essentially the “house-keeping/promoter” compartment of the chromatin landscape.

1. Accessibility profile  
   • The peaks are open in virtually every lineage and somite stage that was profiled (pseudobulk signal ≈ 2–2.5 for most samples).  
   • No single lineage loses accessibility, but the Para-axial/segmental mesoderm sample at 30 somites shows a conspicuously stronger signal (≈ 6), probably reflecting the large cell fraction of this tissue in that library rather than true lineage specificity.  
   • A few tissues with very small nuclei counts (e.g. epidermis 30 som, tail-bud 30 som) drop to background, again indicating that the peaks are not lineage-restricted but may fall below the detection threshold when coverage is low.

2. Gene content  
   • >10 000 genes are linked to the cluster; they span metabolic enzymes (Glycolysis, TCA, lipid metabolism), ribosomal and translation factors, membrane transporters, cytoskeleton, cell-cycle genes, and a very large panel of developmental regulators (Sox, Fox, Hox, Pax, Mef2, Tbx, Gata, etc.).  
   • The breadth of the list and the inclusion of many major transcription-factor loci is typical for promoter-associated peaks that are active in most cells.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • Motifs from nearly every large TF family are significantly enriched:  
     – General/ubiquitous factors – CTCF, YY1, ETS, KLF/SP, E2F, CREB/ATF, TEAD.  
     – Developmental families – SOX, FOX, HOX/TALE (Pbx/Meis), PAX, NK, IRX, SIX, TBX, MEF2, RUNX, GATA, NR (nuclear receptors), NFAT, NF-κB, etc.  
   • Such a broad motif spectrum is a hallmark of promoter regions rather than lineage-restricted enhancers; they accommodate binding of many different TFs depending on cellular context.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster 1 represents constitutively accessible promoters of the core gene set required for basic cell viability and for maintaining the developmental potential of embryonic cells.  
   • Its modest but universal signal means that virtually every cell keeps these promoters open, while lineage-specific transcriptional output is later determined by enhancer clusters that are not in this group.  
   • The spike in late PSM most likely reflects sample composition, not a true PSM-specific regulatory program.

In short, peak cluster 1 is a large, promoter-rich, ubiquitously accessible chromatin compartment that underpins basal transcriptional capacity across all zebrafish embryonic lineages.
]

## Cluster 2

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 2 marks a set of regulatory regions that behave almost pan-tissue at low level (≈ 4–6 logCPM in most pseudobulk profiles) but “switch on” very strongly in late enteric-neuron progenitors: the 30-somite enteric-neuron sample reaches 22.7 logCPM, > 4-fold higher than every other sample.  A weaker but consistent rise is also seen in differentiating spinal / hind-brain neurons from 10–30 somites, pointing to a neural-crest-derived, post-mitotic neuronal context for these peaks.

The associated gene catalogue reinforces this view.  It is heavily enriched for:
•  neuronal structural and synaptic genes (UNC13B, RIMBP2, NRXN2, GRIN/GRIK/GRIA ionotropic glutamate receptors, GABR‐, CACNA1/2/β sub-units, RYR2);  
•  axon-guidance and adhesion genes (CNTNAPs, ROBO1-3, L1CAM-family, SEMA3/4/6, PLEXIN-B & C);  
•  Ca2+/cAMP signalling components (ADCYs, CAMK family, CALN1, CREB-responsive genes);  
•  A–P and dorsoventral patterning transcription factors (multiple HOX clusters, PAX3/6/7, LHX, DLX, PBX/MEIS, FOXG/F/D/F, SOX1/2/3/9/10 and many others).

Motif over-representation mirrors the gene content.  The most positively enriched motifs map to SOX, FOX, HOX/PBX-MEIS, PAX, LHX/DLX as well as MEF2, NR2F/RAR/ROR nuclear receptors and E2F/CTCF sites, indicating that these regions integrate neural-crest identity cues (Sox10, Foxd3), A–P positional information (Hox/Pbx/Meis), neuronal differentiation drivers (NeuroD/Ascl, MEF2) and late cell-cycle exit (E2F).

Taken together, peak-cluster 2 represents enhancer elements that become maximally active when vagal neural-crest cells commit to, and differentiate as, enteric neurons during the 20–30-somite window.  They integrate classic neural-crest TFs with Hox-code and synaptic maturation programs, making the cluster a valuable marker set for studying enteric-neuron specification and late neuronal maturation in zebrafish embryogenesis.

## Cluster 3

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 3 marks enhancers that become progressively more accessible as somitogenesis proceeds and are used predominantly by mid-line/neuronal derivatives of the embryo.

1. Cell-type specificity  
   • Highest chromatin accessibility is seen in axial mid-line tissues and the developing CNS:  
     – notochord (≈23–32 au), floor plate / neural-floor-plate, hindbrain and midbrain–hindbrain boundary, optic neuro-epithelium and differentiating neurons (values > 14 au by 20–30 som).  
   • Accessibility is low–moderate in mesodermal or endodermal tissues (PSM, LPM, endoderm, muscle, pancreas; 5–8 au).  
   • This pattern indicates that the elements are switched on after neural plate formation and remain active in neural tube derivatives and the notochord.

2. Gene content  
   The peak set is linked to > 3,000 genes that are typical of neuronal differentiation, neural patterning and mid-line identity, e.g.  
   – Transcription factors: many SOX (sox2/3/5/11/14/21), FOX (foxa/f/f2, foxg1, foxd3, foxp1/2/4), HOX (multiple anterior and posterior paralogs), PAX (pax2/3/6/7), LHX, DLX, IRX, NKX, PBX/MEIS, MSX, ZIC, DMRT, NR (RAR/RXR, COUP-TF, ROR) and MEF2 family.  
   – Neuronal/axon genes: ROBO1/2/3, UNC5C, ERBB4, GRIA/GRIK/GRID receptors, RYR2, synaptotagmins, cadherins and contactins.  
   – Mid-line structural genes: COL4/5/15, FN1, SHH/HH pathway components.

3. Motif enrichment  
   Motifs for the same TF families dominate: SOX, FOX, HOX/PBX-MEIS, PAX, LHX/DLX/IRX, RAR/RXR/COUP-TF, MEF2, E2F, basic-helix–loop–helix (ATOH/NEUROD) and CREB/ATF.  This agrees with the gene list and with known regulators of neural tube patterning, hindbrain segmentation and notochord specification.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   • Cluster 3 represents a regulatory programme that is first engaged around or just after neurulation and is maximal by 15–30 somites.  
   • It underlies patterning of the anterior–posterior neural tube (HOX code), dorsoventral mid-line structures (floor plate / notochord) and subsequent neuronal differentiation.  
   • Retinoic-acid and nuclear-receptor motifs suggest RA signalling is an important upstream input, consistent with hindbrain patterning.  
   • The simultaneous enrichment for proliferation-linked E2F motifs and differentiation factors (MEF2, NEUROD) indicates that these enhancers span the transition from proliferating neuroepithelium to post-mitotic neurons.

In summary, peak-cluster 3 captures late-neurulation to early-organogenesis enhancers that drive mid-line and CNS patterning, governed by SOX/FOX/HOX/PAX and nuclear-receptor transcriptional networks.
]

## Cluster 4

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 4 represents a very large set of chromatin regions that are accessible in virtually every tissue we profiled from the shield stage (0 somites) up to the 30-somite stage.  In the pseudo-bulk matrix these peaks show a fairly flat signal (≈1.3–2.0 log-CPM) in all neuroectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal lineages and drop appreciably only in late epidermis, indicating that they behave almost like “core” promoters/enhancers that stay open across most embryonic cell types.

1. Gene content  
   • >5 000 linked genes; many are basic cellular/house-keeping genes but there is a clear over-representation of neural/axonal genes – voltage-gated channels (CACNA2D1/3, KCN-, HCN-, RYR), neurotransmitter receptors (GABRB2, GRIK2/3, GRM7, GRIA1-4), synaptic scaffolds (SHANK3, RIMS/UNC13, LRRTM4, FRMPD, SHC3) and guidance / adhesion molecules (SEMA4F, UNC5C, NRXN, CNTN, CADM, PCDH, L1CAM family).  
   • Many developmental transcription factors are present in the gene list itself (e.g. LHX6, NPAS3, TCF4, PRDM8, SOX family members, numerous HOX genes).

2. Motif / TF enrichment  
   • The strongest motif signature is homeobox-driven.  Cluster-4 peaks are enriched for binding sites of Hox, Dlx, Nkx, Lhx, Msx, Barhl, Vax, Gbx, Pbx/Meis and related factors – the classical regulators of anterior-posterior and dorso-ventral patterning of the neural tube and branchial arches.  
   • Additional over-represented motifs belong to the Sox, Fox, Pax/Irx and Six families, all of which mark early neural progenitors and cranial/cardiac crest.  
   • Virtually no enrichment for myogenic (Myf/Mef2), endodermal (Gata/Foxa) or epidermal (p63, Grhl) motifs, supporting a primarily neuroectodermal regulatory flavour.

3. Biological interpretation  
   • These peaks most likely correspond to constitutively open promoters plus a large collection of early pan-neural and patterning enhancers.  
   • Their ubiquitous accessibility suggests that they provide a basal transcriptional scaffold that is “ready” in almost every cell, while lineage-specific factors (e.g. Hox codes, Sox/Fox/Pax combinations) further refine the output in neural and pattern-forming contexts.  
   • The motif composition, together with the linked gene set, strongly points to a role in establishing and maintaining neural-tube identity along the anterior-posterior axis and in driving early neuronal differentiation programmes.

In short, peak-cluster 4 can be viewed as a broad, largely constitutive chromatin compartment that is especially geared towards neural patterning and early neuronal gene expression, maintained in an open state throughout most embryonic tissues during the 0- to 30-somite window.
]

## Cluster 5

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 5 corresponds to a set of regulatory elements that are most accessible in the surface ectoderm / embryonic epidermis during early segmentation stages.

1. Activity profile  
   • Pseudobulk accessibility is highest in the “epidermis” samples (0–20-somite stages ~35-38 a.u.; still above background at 30 somites).  
   • Accessibility is much lower (≈7–15 a.u.) in mesodermal, endodermal or neural tissues, indicating strong tissue selectivity.  
   • The signal drops markedly by the 30-somite stage, suggesting that these elements act mainly during the establishment and early maturation of the epidermis.

2. Associated genes  
   The peak set is linked to many classical epidermal / epithelial genes, e.g.  
   – Keratins (krt1-19d, krt17, krt18a.1, krt4, krt92-99)  
   – Tight-junction/adhesion components (cldn1, cldn7a/b, oclna/b, epcam, itga6b, itgb6)  
   – Secreted/ECM molecules (fn1a, lama3, lamc1, tnc, vcan)  
   – Signalling molecules expressed in surface ectoderm (wnt10a, wnt6b, fgf24, bmp2b/7a, sulf1/2)  
   – Epidermal TFs themselves (irf6, tfap2a/c/d, grhl1/2/3, klf4/17, p63/tp63).  
   Collectively these genes underlie epithelial polarity, barrier formation and early stratification.

3. Transcription-factor motif enrichment  
   Motifs and factor families significantly over-represented include:  
   • Grainyhead (GRHL1/2/3) – key drivers of epidermal enhancer activity.  
   • TFAP2 (tfap2a/c/d/e) and TP63/TFCP2 – central regulators of ectoderm specification and periderm formation.  
   • KLF/Sp and C/EBP families that promote epithelial differentiation.  
   • IRF6 and IKZF/STAT – factors genetically linked to periderm morphogenesis and skin integrity.  
   • AP-1 (FOS/JUN), TEAD, CREB/ATF and FOX/FOXI motifs, consistent with Wnt/FGF/BMP and Hippo signalling inputs that shape epidermal gene expression.

4. Biological interpretation  
   The accessibility pattern, gene associations and TF signature all point to these peaks being epidermis-specific enhancers/promoters that become active as soon as surface ectoderm is specified and remain open while the embryonic skin (periderm + basal layer) expands. Their diminished accessibility at the 30-somite stage suggests they are involved primarily in early epidermal induction rather than later keratinocyte maturation.

In short, peak cluster 5 captures the core chromatin programme of early zebrafish surface ectoderm / epidermis, driven by Grainyhead, TFAP2, p63, KLF, IRF6 and related transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 6

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 6 marks a set of regulatory elements that stay modestly open in most tissues during early somitogenesis ( ≈ 4 a.u. in NMP, PSM, neural and endoderm samples) but “switch on” very strongly at late stages in two cell populations:

1. Skeletal / fast muscle – especially the generic “muscle_30-somite” pseudobulk (46 a.u.) and, to a lesser extent, the dedicated fast-muscle track (5.8 a.u.).  
2. Endocrine pancreas – pronounced accessibility at the 30-somite time point (22 a.u.).

Gene annotation of the peaks is consistent with this pattern.  Many of the linked genes encode:

• Contractile or sarcomeric proteins and calcium-handling components (ACTC1, MYOG, TNNI2a.3, TTN, RYR2, SMYD1, MYLK3, MYO18A, MYH-class genes).  
• Myogenic signalling / transcription factors (MEF2 family, SRF-related factors, MYOD1, MYF5/6).  
• Endocrine/β-cell or secretory transporters (ABCC8b, SLC30A8, PDX1-associated loci).

Motif enrichment reinforces the biology:

• A strong E2F / FOXM1 signature (E2F1-8, FOXM1) – typical of proliferative myoblasts that are still cycling.  
• Classic myogenic regulators (MEF2A/B/C/D, SRF, TCF-family, bHLH factors such as MYOD1, MYOG, MYF5/6).  
• Nuclear receptor motifs (RAR/RXR, PPAR, NR5A, ROR) that frequently control metabolic maturation in both muscle and endocrine pancreas.  
• GATA and PDX-related motifs appear at lower rank, matching the pancreatic component.

Taken together, cluster 6 represents late-somite enhancers that become highly accessible in differentiating skeletal muscle (primary target) and in maturing endocrine pancreas cells.  They likely integrate cell-cycle cues (E2F/FOXM1) with lineage-specific myogenic and metabolic transcription factors to drive the final waves of contractile and secretory gene expression as zebrafish embryos approach the end of somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 7

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 7 represents a set of genomic regions that behave like ubiquitously open promoters.

1. Chromatin accessibility pattern  
   • The pseudobulk signal is high ( ≈ 1.6 – 2.2 log-counts) in virtually every cell type and at every somite stage that was profiled.  
   • Only a handful of samples (e.g. some late epidermis, fast-muscle and tail-bud libraries) show values close to background, indicating that the great majority of peaks in this cluster are constitutively accessible.

2. Associated gene set  
   • >7,000 genes are linked to these peaks.  They span basic cellular processes—ribosome assembly, mitochondrial respiration, membrane traffic, cytoskeleton, DNA/RNA metabolism, ion transport, etc.—and include archetypal housekeeping loci (e.g. actins, tubulins, HSPs, metabolic enzymes, ABC/SLC transporters, translation factors).  
   • Very few lineage-restricted regulators appear, reinforcing the conclusion that the cluster is not tissue-specific.

3. Motif / transcription-factor enrichment  
   • The motif list is extremely broad: core promoter factors (SP/KLF, ETS, NRF, YY1, CTCF), cell-cycle regulators (E2F, MYBL), general developmental TF families (SOX, FOX, Hox, MEF2, T-box, homeobox, nuclear receptors), stress-response factors (HSF, ATF/CREB, AP-1).  
   • Such breadth is typical of promoter-proximal DNA that is bound by the basal transcription machinery together with many context-dependent TFs.  
   • No single lineage-defining TF dominates, again pointing to constitutive rather than lineage-restricted activity.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster 7 corresponds to a “housekeeping-promoter” class: regions that are open in most or all cells to drive genes required for basic cell viability and growth.  
   • The uniform accessibility across neuromesodermal progenitors, paraxial mesoderm, neural plate, endoderm, ectoderm, muscle, blood and more suggests that these peaks mark core promoters rather than distal, cell-type-specific enhancers.  
   • Their TF motif spectrum further supports a promoter identity, enriched for factors that recruit or modulate the general transcriptional apparatus.

In short, peak-cluster 7 delineates constitutively accessible, promoter-like elements that control housekeeping genes and are used by essentially every cell type during zebrafish somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 8

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 8 represents a set of regulatory regions that is almost exclusively open in neural-crest–derived cells during the segmentation period.

1. Pseudobulk accessibility profile  
• The signal is modest (≈10 AU) in most embryonic tissues, but rises steeply in neural-crest samples, reaching 17-21 AU from 0- to 30-somite stages.  
• No other lineage shows a comparable jump; thus the cluster marks a neural-crest-specific chromatin programme that remains active throughout trunk and cranial crest maturation.

2. Nearby / putative target genes  
The >3000 genes that co-map to these peaks are heavily enriched for classical neural-crest specifiers, EMT regulators and migratory/mesenchymal effectors, e.g.  
• Specifiers sox10, sox9a/b, sox8a/b, foxd3, pax3/7, tfap2 family, snai1a/​snai2, twist1/2/3, zeb1a/b.  
• Patterning dlx1/2/4/5/6, alx1/3/4, hox-B/C cluster members, irx, barx, lbx, gbx, meis, pbx.  
• Guidance & ECM cadm, cdh2/6/11, itga4/8, epha4, ephb2/4, sema3, slit/robo, multiple collagens (col11a1, col12a1, col14a1), thbs2/3/4.  
• Signalling receptors/ligands fgf8a/17/20, wnt5b/11f2, pdgfrα/β, met, ror1/2, ednraa, angptl, notch1a.  
Together these genes cover induction, migration, survival and differentiation steps of neural-crest development.

3. Motif enrichment  
Motif analysis (row 8 and allied rows) highlights families that constitute the canonical neural-crest GRN:  
• FOX (FoxD3, FoxF, FoxI, FoxK, FoxG)  
• SOX (Sox10, 9, 8, 5, 6, 2, 3)  
• PAX (Pax3/7/6), DLX, ALX and multiple HOX paralog groups  
• EMT/mesenchyme factors (TWIST, SNAI, ZEB)  
• AP-2, ETS, TEAD/SRF, MEF2 and pioneer factors CTCF/Yy1.  
This combination matches the transcriptional circuitry that initiates neural-crest identity, drives epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and routes cells toward diverse derivatives.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, cluster 8 appears to comprise enhancers that (i) switch on as epiblast cells acquire neural-crest fate, (ii) stay accessible through migration and early differentiation, and (iii) control genes needed for craniofacial, peripheral-neuron, pigment-cell and mesenchymal lineages. The sustained accessibility from 0- to 30-somite stages suggests these elements integrate early specifier input (Sox/​Fox/​Pax) with later patterning cues (Hox, Dlx, Alx) to maintain a flexible but crest-restricted chromatin state.
]

## Cluster 9

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 9 captures a set of cis-regulatory regions that are turned on very selectively during eye-field formation and early retinal morphogenesis.

1. Cell-type/temporal accessibility  
   • Accessibility is at a “background” log2 value of ~3–4 in most tissues.  
   • It jumps nearly 20-fold in the optic cup at 5 som and explodes (≈60) at 15 som—the developmental window in which the optic vesicle invaginates to form the optic cup.  
   • A second but smaller spike (≈11) is seen in late (30 som) enteric neurons, and mild enrichment is present in other anterior neural populations (midbrain-hindbrain boundary, hindbrain).  

2. Gene neighbourhood  
   The 3,000 + peaks are positioned near many canonical eye-field / retinal genes and regulators, e.g. rx1/3, vsx1/2, otx1/2, pax6a/b, crx, six3/6, lhx2, rorb, foxg1, tbx2/3, hmx1/3.  Numerous neurogenic and axon-guidance genes (epha4, robo1, slit3, nrp2), neuronal adhesion molecules (cntn3/4/5, cadm1b) and photoreceptor genes (crx, nrl, rorα/β) are also represented, reinforcing a retinal/neuro-ectodermal identity.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • Homeobox / Paired: VSX, RAX (Rx), OTX, PAX, LHX, NKX, HMX, MEIS/PBX/Hox clusters.  
   • SOX family (sox2/3/5/10/11/14/19) – typical eye-field and neuroectoderm factors.  
   • FOX family (foxg1, foxd1/3/5, foxi, foxl, foxc) – known for temporal patterning along the A-P axis and nasal/temporal retina specification.  
   • Nuclear receptors linked to retinoic-acid and lipid signalling (RAR/RXR, ROR, NR2F/COUP-TFs) – consistent with retinoid control of eye development.  
   • Cell-cycle/E2F and TEAD/MEF2 motifs suggest concomitant proliferation and early neuronal differentiation.

4. Biological interpretation  
   The temporal spike in the optic cup, the repertoire of nearby genes, and the TF-motif signature together indicate that cluster 9 comprises enhancers that orchestrate specification and early differentiation of retinal progenitors at 5- to 15-somite stages.  Their later re-use in enteric neurons hints at shared regulatory logic between retinal and peripheral neuronal lineages.

In short, peak-cluster 9 is a retina-centric regulatory module, peaking during optic-cup formation and governed by the classic eye-field transcription-factor network (SOX–PAX–OTX–RX–FOX), with ancillary activity in specific neuronal derivatives later in development.
]

## Cluster 10

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 10 represents a “myogenic” chromatin programme that switches on as soon as paraxial mesoderm begins to segment and stays highly active through the 30-somite stage.  

1. Pseudobulk accessibility pattern  
   • The signal is modest in neuromesodermal progenitors and presomitic mesoderm (≈5–15) but rises sharply in somites and all muscle-containing samples.  
   • It is maximal in fast-skeletal-muscle and generic “muscle” pseudobulks (22–46 a.u.) and remains high in the somite fractions (17–34 a.u.).  
   • Most non-mesodermal lineages (neural, endoderm, epidermis, pancreas, etc.) show only basal levels (~4–7).  
   → Therefore the accessible peaks are almost exclusive to the skeletal-muscle lineage and its immediate precursors.

2. Gene content of the cluster  
   The peak set is linked to hundreds of canonical muscle genes, for example  
   • Structural & contractile: acta1a/b, actc1, actn3, myh7/9, myl1/4/13, tnnc2, tnni1/2, tnnt1/2, neb, tmod4, ryr1/3, casq1/2, fhl1/3, smyhc1-3, xirp1/2.  
   • Sarcomere assembly / membrane & ECM: lama2, lrrc32, lpp, loxl1, col4/5/7/12/15/21, fn1, sv2, dystrophin complex genes.  
   • Myogenic regulators: myod1, myf5, myog, myf6, mef2 (all paralogues), tbx18, tbx4/5, pax3/7, hoxA/B/C cluster members, runx3, foxo, e2f, etc.  
   Together these genes map the full trajectory from segmenting mesoderm to differentiated fast-twitch myofibres.

3. Transcription-factor motif enrichment  
   Motif analysis reinforces the myogenic identity:  
   • Core myogenic bHLH factors – MYOD, MYF5/6, MYOG, TCF12/21.  
   • MEF2 family and SRF which cooperate with MRFs to drive sarcomere genes.  
   • TEAD/TAZ–YAP, TBX, E2F and HOX/PAX motifs, reflecting growth-control and axial patterning of the myotome.  
   • GATA, FOX and NFAT sites appear but at much lower scores, consistent with limited activity in non-muscle mesoderm.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Peak-cluster 10 marks enhancers and promoters that open specifically in paraxial-mesoderm-derived fast skeletal muscle.  Accessibility rises as soon as somites mature (≈10 s) and peaks when fibres differentiate (15–30 s), matching the time when contracting fast muscle first appears in the zebrafish trunk and tail.  The TF landscape (MRFs + MEF2 + SRF) and the gene inventory (sarcomeric and excitation–contraction components) indicate that these regions control terminal differentiation and maturation rather than early fate choice.

In short, cluster 10 captures the genomic regulatory circuit that builds the embryonic fast-skeletal-muscle system during zebrafish somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 11

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 11 corresponds to a set of chromatin regions that behave like “house-keeping / core-promoter” elements rather than lineage-restricted enhancers.

1. Accessibility pattern  
• The pseudobulk ATAC signal is high in virtually every tissue and at every somitogenesis stage (≈ 35–45 log-counts), with only modest fluctuations (coefficient of variation ≈ 10 %).  
• The highest values are seen in very transcriptionally active tissues at the 30-somite stage (optic cup ≈ 54.6, notochord ≈ 51.7, endoderm ≈ 47.7, somites ≈ 47.0), whereas the lowest signal is confined to late tail-bud (≈ 33).  
• Such pan-tissue accessibility implies that these peaks represent constitutively open chromatin.

2. Gene content  
• The cluster is linked to several thousand genes, including a large fraction of essential metabolic, cytoskeletal and vesicle-trafficking genes (actb1, rpl/rps families, atp synthase subunits, etc.) together with many early developmental regulators (multiple Fox, Sox, Hox, Pax, Tbx, Nkx, Pbx, Meis, Nr, E2f, Klf, Runx …).  
• This mixture is typical of promoter-proximal regions that need to be accessible in most cell types while still allowing binding of stage- or lineage-specific TFs when required.

3. Motif enrichment  
• Virtually every major DNA-binding family is over-represented: general promoter factors (Sp/Klf, E2F, Creb/Atf, Mef2, Myc/Max), architectural proteins (CTCF, YY1), broad developmental families (Fox, Sox, Hox/Pbx/Meis, Pax, Nkx, Irx, Six, Tcf/Lef, Gata, nuclear-receptor half-sites) and stress-responsive factors (Nrf, Batf, Hsf).  
• No single lineage-specific signature dominates, reinforcing the idea of universal rather than cell-type–restricted usage.

4. Biological interpretation  
• Cluster 11 most likely represents constitutively accessible promoter regions that provide a permissive chromatin environment throughout zebrafish embryogenesis.  
• These regions are reused by many TFs as development proceeds, explaining the broad motif spectrum and the slight tissue-specific amplitude differences.  
• Functionally, they underpin basal transcription of core cellular machinery while remaining competent to integrate additional regulatory inputs when a given gene is recruited for lineage-specific programmes.

In short, peak-cluster 11 can be viewed as the “ubiquitous promoter / housekeeping chromatin” compartment of the embryonic zebrafish epigenome: open nearly everywhere, enriched for generic promoter motifs, and associated with genes required in most or all cell types.
]

## Cluster 12

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 12 represents a set of chromatin regions that become progressively more accessible as neural lineages mature and are most strongly open in late-stage enteric / differentiating neurons (peak accessibility at the 30-somite stage; enteric_neurons_30 ≈ 16-fold above the dataset average).  Accessibility is already detectable at the 0-somite stage in a wide range of neural tissues, but rises steadily in neurons, spinal cord and hindbrain and remains only basal in non-neuronal mesodermal or endodermal derivatives.

Gene-peak links (≈3 500 genes) are heavily biased toward neuronal functions:
• axon guidance / cell-adhesion receptors ADGRL2, ADGRL3, NRXN2, ROR1/2, ROBO1/2  
• synaptic vesicle exocytosis UNC13B, RIMS2, SYT2, SNAP25, STXBP1  
• glutamatergic / GABAergic transmission GRIK2/3, GRM7, SLC17A6, SLC6A1, GABRB2  
• voltage-gated ion channels KCNT1, KCNH2, KCNJ6, CACNA2D1/3, PIEZO2  
• neuronal TFs NPAS3/4, LHX3, PRDM15, TCF12, RUNX3

GO terms retrieved from this gene set centre on “neurogenesis”, “synapse organisation”, “axonogenesis”, and “regulation of membrane potential”, supporting a role in late neuronal differentiation / functional maturation.

Motif enrichment points to transcription factors that drive this programme:
• high-scoring motifs (positive z-scores) NFAT family (M06010), FOXC/FOXJ, MEF2, ROR/RXR nuclear-receptor sites  
• over-represented TF families in indirect motif list SOX (SOX2/10/11/21), PAX6/7, HOX and LHX homeodomain factors, E2F/TFDP (cell-cycle exit of neuroblasts) and bHLH proneural factors (NEUROD, ATOH).  

Taken together, cluster 12 appears to mark enhancers that switch on as neural crest–derived and central-nervous-system neurons leave the cell cycle and acquire mature electrophysiological and synaptic properties, with strongest activity in differentiating enteric neurons.  NFAT/FOXC-type factors together with SOX, PAX6/7 and MEF2 likely cooperate to activate this late-neuronal chromatin programme.
]

## Cluster 13

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 13 corresponds to a set of regulatory elements that become highly accessible as the embryo enters early somitogenesis and then taper off towards the 30-somite stage.

1. Cell-type/temporal activity  
• Accessibility is moderate in virtually every lineage (log2-values ≈ 12), but it is distinctly higher (≥ 14) in tissues that build the axial trunk:  
  – Neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs) at 0–5 somites  
  – Differentiating neurons, hind-/mid-brain and spinal cord  
  – Paraxial mesoderm derivatives (somites, fast muscle) and tail-bud  
  – Cranial mesoderm / pharyngeal arches (the highest signal; 17.5 at 0 somites)  
  – A striking spike in notochord at 20 somites (likely a real but very local burst of accessibility)  
Accessibility gradually declines by the 30-somite stage, consistent with an early patterning role.

2. Associated genes  
The peak set is linked to hundreds of genes that encode classical axial-patterning and neurogenic regulators, e.g. the bulk of the HOX clusters (hoxa–d), many DLX, LHX, PAX, PBX/MEIS, FOX, SOX and TBX family members, plus signalling components of the FGF, Wnt, BMP and retinoic-acid pathways.  This gene composition is typical of programmes that specify trunk identity and coordinate concurrent differentiation of neural tube, mesoderm and pharyngeal structures.

3. Motif enrichment  
Motifs over-represented in these peaks largely mirror the gene list:  
• HOX/PBX–MEIS composite sites, DLX, LHX, PAX, PBX, SOX and FOX motifs – hallmarks of anterior-posterior patterning and neurogenesis.  
• Nuclear receptors (RAR/RXR, COUP-TFs, NR4A) – consistent with retinoic-acid responsiveness.  
• E-box/NeuroD and MEF2 motifs – supporting muscle and neuronal differentiation.  
• E2F sites – hinting at transient proliferative progenitor states.  

4. Biological interpretation  
Together, the accessibility profile, gene content and motif landscape indicate that peak cluster 13 represents a trunk “patterning-and-differentiation” enhancer module.  It is switched on just after gastrulation, remains active in multiple trunk-building lineages (neural tube, paraxial mesoderm, pharyngeal arches, notochord) during the first 10–20 somites, and then progressively shuts down as those tissues mature.  The cluster is likely controlled by RA/HOX positional cues and SOX/FOX factors that integrate mesodermal and neuroectodermal programmes, thereby coordinating the simultaneous emergence of spinal cord neurons, somites, axial musculature and craniofacial mesenchyme in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 14

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 14 represents a set of cis-regulatory elements that become progressively more accessible during mid-somite stages (10-30 somites).  In the ATAC-seq pseudobulk profiles the cluster shows

1.  Very high accessibility in trunk mesoderm derivatives – especially newly forming somites (peaks reach their maximum around 15 somites and remain high up to 30 somites).  
2.  A parallel, although slightly weaker, opening in endodermal derivatives (gut tube and endocrine pancreas) and in the heart myocardium.  
3.  Only low-to-moderate signal in neuro-ectodermal tissues, neural crest, epidermis or tail-bud progenitors.

Together, this pattern is typical of enhancer sets that drive the maturation of paraxial mesoderm and early organ primordia once axial elongation is under way.

Gene assignments reinforce this view.  The cluster is linked to large numbers of extracellular-matrix and adhesion genes (e.g. multiple ADAMTS family members, collagens, Tenascin-C, many integrin sub-units), signalling receptors and ligands important for somite and organ morphogenesis (FGFR1, PDGFRA, VEGFA, Wnt5b, BMP7b, FGF10/11/13), as well as a broad panel of developmental transcription factors that act in paraxial mesoderm, heart and endoderm (HoxA/C, Tbx1/4/5/20, FoxA1/2/3, Gata4/5/6, Sox6/9/17, Meox, Lhx, Pax genes).

Motif enrichment points to the trans-acting regulators likely to activate these elements.  The most over-represented motifs correspond to bZIP/bHLH-Leu-zip factors of the MiT/TFE and BACH families together with circadian/ARNT-related partners (MITF/Tfec/Tfe3, Bhlhe40/41, Arnt/Arntl, Bach1/2, Usf2).  These factors are known to cooperate with MEF2, SRF and GATA proteins in mesodermal differentiation and to couple metabolic and redox states to transcription – fitting the oxidative-metabolic transition that somites and nascent organs undergo at these stages.

In summary, peak-cluster 14 marks enhancers that switch on in the trunk mesoderm, endoderm and early heart around the 10- to 30-somite window.  They are enriched for MiT/TFE- and BACH-family motifs and are associated with genes driving extracellular matrix production, cell adhesion, signalling and transcriptional control required for somite maturation, myogenesis, gut/endocrine specification and early cardiogenesis.

## Cluster 15

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 15 is most active in tissues that belong to the paraxial-mesoderm/muscle trajectory of the embryo.  
• Pseudo-bulk accessibility is very low at the 0-somite stage but rises sharply from the 5-somite stage in “fast-muscle”, “muscle”, “somites” and “tail-bud” samples and remains high through 30 somites, while remaining at or near background in epidermis, endoderm or most neural derivatives.  
• The peak set is loaded with structural and contractile muscle genes and their regulators – e.g. ACTC1, TNNC2, RYR2, MYH6/7, FLNA/B, TNC, PAX3/7, SIX1/2, TBX15/18, MYRF – together with many ECM and cytoskeleton components that are typical for early myotome formation.  
• Motif analysis points to the same lineage: strong enrichment for MEF2, MYOD/E-box partners, HOX (especially central / posterior HoxC–HoxD), PAX, SIX, TBX and FOX motifs as well as the generic myogenic partner SRF.  These factors are well known drivers of somite patterning and myoblast differentiation.  
• Additional motifs for SOX, IRX and E2F families suggest contributions from early paraxial progenitors, proliferating myoblasts and posterior axial patterning signals.  

Taken together, cluster 15 appears to represent cis-regulatory elements that become accessible when trunk paraxial mesoderm is segmented into somites and the skeletal-muscle programme switches on, providing the regulatory scaffold for posterior trunk / tail myogenesis in the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 16

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 16 corresponds to a “house-keeping / CpG-island promoter” class of open chromatin.

1. Chromatin accessibility pattern  
• The pseudobulk signal is medium-to-high (log2 ≈ 5–7) in virtually every lineage and time-point that was profiled.  
• It is not confined to a single germ layer; neural, mesodermal, endodermal and extra-embryonic cell types all show comparable accessibility.  
• A few early tissues (e.g. pharyngeal arches at the 0-somite stage, notochord and hemangioblasts) display the strongest signal, whereas late time-points (30-somites epidermis, tail fin, etc.) show a modest decline, consistent with a set of promoters that are most active in rapidly dividing progenitors and become slightly less accessible as cells differentiate.

2. Associated genes  
The peak list is extraordinarily broad (>3 000 genes).  It contains many canonical “house-keeping” genes that drive core biosynthetic, metabolic and cell-cycle functions (e.g. UBB, RPL/RPS, CTBP1, MAP kinases, ubiquitin-pathway components) together with a mix of lineage regulators (numerous FOX, HOX, SOX, PAX, TBX, MEIS/PBX, GATA factors, etc.).  Such promoter-heavy composition is typical of CpG-island peaks that sit at the 5′ ends of genes which must remain transcription-ready across lineages.

3. Motif enrichment  
The only direct motif that emerges is for the CXXC-domain histone demethylase Kdm2b (and its paralogues).  KDM2B, CXXC1 and related factors have a strong biochemical preference for unmethylated CpG-islands and are hallmarks of constitutively open promoters.  The indirect list (Cxxc1/4/5, Lin28, DNMT1, Atf4, Gmeb1/2, etc.) strengthens this interpretation, pointing to factors involved in CpG recognition, chromatin maintenance and general stress-responsive transcription rather than lineage-restricted enhancers.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, cluster 16 represents a set of broadly accessible, CpG-rich promoter elements that underpin the basal transcriptional programme of the embryo.  These promoters are already open in the earliest segmentation stages and remain accessible in nearly all somatic lineages, providing a permissive chromatin environment for both ubiquitous genes and a wide array of developmental regulators that can be selectively activated as cells commit to specific fates.
]

## Cluster 17

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 17 contains a set of open-chromatin regions that behave like classical “anterior ectoderm / sensory–organ” enhancers.

1. Activity pattern  
• The peaks are already accessible at the 0-somite stage and remain moderately to highly accessible through the 30-somite stage in most ectoderm-derived samples (neural plate, hind-/mid-brain, retina/optic cup, cranial placodes, differentiating neurons).  
• Accessibility is lower in mesoderm-derived fast muscle, endoderm, or extra-embryonic lineages, indicating a bias toward neural/placodal territories.

2. Genes in the vicinity of the peaks  
More than 2 000 nearby genes are annotated; many are prototypical regulators or effectors of anterior neural plate and cranial-placodal development, e.g.  
 • eye–field / forebrain: six3/6/7/9, rx1/2/3, otx1/2/5, pax6, vsx1, lmx1, crx, tbx2/3/5, vax1/2, irx family  
 • cranial placode / sensory line: dlx1/2/5/6, barhl1, hmx1/2/3/4, lbx1/2, gsx1/2, pknox/pbx–co-factors  
 • sex-/sensory-organ regulators: dmrt1/2/3, gata family, tbx and fox gene clusters.  
Many housekeeping genes are also present, but the developmental signature is dominated by the eye/forebrain and placodal cohort.

3. Enriched transcription-factor motifs  
Motif enrichment pinpoints the expected regulators:  
 • SIX homeobox family (six1/2/3/4/5/6/7/9) – strongest signal  
 • DMRT family (dmrt1/2/3)  
 • Additional over-represented motifs for GATA, TBX, FOXC/FOXG, PAX, and IRX factors – all known partners in anterior neural plate and cranial placode gene-regulatory networks.  
No single “direct” pioneer factor dominates (direct column = nan), indicating that several of these factors may cooperate at the same enhancers.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, cluster 17 marks enhancers that are:  
 • switched on very early (shield–to-tailbud) and stay open through somitogenesis;  
 • preferentially active in anterior ectoderm derivatives—the eye field, forebrain, and cranial placodes—and, to a lesser extent, in differentiating neurons elsewhere;  
 • under the control of the Six–Dmrt–Fox/Pax/Tbx transcription-factor cassette that drives specification of sensory organs, craniofacial mesenchyme, and parts of the endocrine system.

In short, peak-cluster 17 represents an anterior neural/placodal enhancer set whose accessibility is coordinated by SIX and DMRT homeobox factors and is likely required for proper eye, forebrain and cranial-placode development during zebrafish segmentation stages.
]

## Cluster 18

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 18 represents a set of chromatin regions that become selectively accessible in anterior lateral-plate/mesoderm-derived tissues as soon as the embryo starts forming somites.

1. Accessibility profile  
• The peaks are already open at the 0-somite stage but intensify between 5-15 somites and remain high up to 30 somites.  
• The highest pseudobulk signal is seen in heart myocardium (≈40–53 a.u. across stages).  
• Secondary, but clear, accessibility is observed in endocrine pancreas and hatching-gland cells – two other endoderm-derived tissues.  
• Most neural, somitic and ectodermal populations show only basal accessibility (≈3–6 a.u.).

2. Gene landscape around the peaks  
The annotation is crowded with canonical cardiac / endoderm genes and their downstream effectors, e.g. gata4/5/6, tbx5/1, nkx2-5, hand2, acta2, myh6/7, vegfa, fgf receptors, wnt2, bmp / smad components, as well as a large array of extracellular-matrix and contractile-protein genes.  This gene content mirrors the expression profile above and points to a cardiopharyngeal/endoderm regulatory module.

3. Transcription-factor logic  
Motif enrichment is dominated by the GATA family (Gata1/2/3/4/5/6) together with the zinc-finger factor Trps1 – a well-known co-factor of GATA proteins in heart and pharyngeal mesoderm.  No strong enrichment for neural (SOX) or myogenic (Myf/Mef2) motifs is detected, reinforcing the cardiac/endoderm identity of the cluster.

4. Biological interpretation  
Taken together, cluster 18 most likely captures enhancers that are activated by the GATA-driven programme that patterns the cardiogenic mesoderm and adjacent anterior endoderm.  These elements remain active through heart-tube formation and the earliest stages of cardiac differentiation, while also being reused in related endodermal derivatives such as the endocrine pancreas and hatching gland.

In short, peak-cluster 18 marks the GATA-dependent regulatory landscape of the early zebrafish heart field and closely allied endodermal tissues during somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 19

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 19 represents a very “broad-use” set of regulatory elements.

1. Pseudobulk accessibility profile  
   • The peaks are open in almost every lineage we profiled, and particularly so during the first half of somitogenesis (0-20 somites).  
   • Accessibility is highest in posterior axial tissues – neuromesodermal progenitors, paraxial mesoderm (PSM) and, most strikingly, the tail-bud at the 10-somite stage ( ≈37‐fold signal spike).  
   • In many differentiated tissues (e.g. epidermis, mature fast-muscle) accessibility falls sharply by the 30-somite stage, indicating that the cluster is linked to proliferative / progenitor states rather than to terminally differentiated cells.

2. Associated gene set  
   • The peak list is huge (thousands of genes) and dominated by housekeeping and core cellular genes (ribosomal proteins, metabolic enzymes, cytoskeletal and vesicle-trafficking components, mitochondrial and spliceosomal factors).  
   • Intermingled are numerous developmental regulators (large fractions of the Hox, Sox, Fox, Pax, Irx, Nkx and T-box families, etc.).  
   • This mixed, “everything-present” composition reinforces the idea that cluster 19 mainly corresponds to promoter-proximal or first-intron regions of genes that must stay transcriptionally competent in many embryonic contexts.

3. Transcription-factor motif enrichment  
   • Only one motif family is significantly enriched – the Gcm2 motif – and even that enrichment is weak.  
   • The absence of a strong, lineage-specific motif signature supports the interpretation that the peaks are largely constitutive/promoter-like rather than enhancer elements controlled by a dedicated developmental TF module.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster 19 captures constitutively open chromatin of genes that need to remain active across multiple germ layers during early zebrafish development.  
   • The transient hypersensitivity seen in the tail-bud/PSM suggests an additional contribution from highly proliferative posterior stem–cell pools (NMPs) that require a globally accessible chromatin landscape for rapid transcriptional output.  
   • Because it lacks a strong, defining TF code, the cluster is unlikely to demarcate a specific lineage programme; instead it represents a “house-keeping / progenitor competence” chromatin state that gradually closes as cells exit the cell cycle and terminally differentiate.

In short, peak cluster 19 is best viewed as a constitutive, promoter-rich set of regions that stay open in rapidly dividing embryonic cells—especially in the posterior growth zone—rather than a signature of a single differentiated lineage.
]

## Cluster 20

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 20 represents a set of chromatin peaks that switch on very late in somitogenesis and almost exclusively in the developing heart.

1. Spatiotemporal activity  
   • Pseudobulk accessibility is uniformly moderate (≈ 5 log CPM) in most lineages and stages, but jumps >10-fold in the myocardium at 30-somite stage (64 log CPM).  
   • Only trace signal is seen in epidermis, tail-bud and other non-muscle tissues, indicating strong tissue specificity that coincides with the onset of heartbeat and chamber morphogenesis in zebrafish (28–30 somites).

2. Linked gene repertoire  
   • The peak set is associated with hundreds of genes that typify differentiated cardiomyocytes and their supporting mesenchyme:  
     – Contractile and sarcomeric: myh7, myh11a, mybpc3, actc1c, tnni4a, tnnc1, tmod2.  
     – Calcium handling/ion channels: cacna2d1, kcnq4, kcnma1a, slc8a1b, ryr3.  
     – Cardiac transcriptional regulators and signalling hubs: gata4/5/6, nkx2.5, tbx5/20, hand2, tcf21, mef2 family, fgf/vegf pathway genes.  
     – ECM and junctional genes needed for chamber morphogenesis (col12a1a/b, lamb2l, lrp1, cdh2, dsp).

3. Motif enrichment  
   • Row 20 of the TF-motif table is dominated by Heat-Shock Factors (HSF1, HSF2) and NFAT family motifs (NFATC1/2/3/4, NFAT5).  
   • Both TF groups are well documented co-regulators of late myocardial differentiation, sarcomere assembly, Ca²⁺-dependent growth signals and stress responsiveness.  
   • Supporting motifs in neighbouring rows (MEF2, GATA, TBX, SRF) further underline a cardiomyogenic regulatory grammar.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster 20 captures the “maturation phase” enhancer landscape of zebrafish cardiomyocytes—elements that remain quiet during early specification but become highly accessible once functional myocardium forms.  
   • The simultaneous enrichment for HSF and NFAT suggests these peaks integrate Ca²⁺/calcineurin and stress-responsive inputs with the core cardiac TF network to drive terminal differentiation and physiological adaptation of the embryonic heart.

In short, peak-cluster 20 marks late-onset, heart-specific enhancers that control the structural, electrophysiological and regulatory gene programme of the nascent zebrafish myocardium at the 30-somite stage.
]

## Cluster 21

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 21 marks a set of regulatory elements that are most active in axial progenitors and early paraxial mesoderm:

1. Where/when does it fire?  
   • Highest chromatin signal in neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMP) and presomitic mesoderm (PSM) from 0-15-somite embryos (≈50-70 a.u.).  
   • Still appreciable in newly formed somites, notochord and tail-bud, but already fading by the 20–30-somite stage.  
   • Very low activity in neural, endodermal, epidermal and pancreatic compartments.

2. Gene content (selected highlights)  
   • Classic paraxial-mesoderm / somitogenesis factors: msgn1, tbx6/16, tbxta/b, mespb, ripply1/2, meox1/2, lbx1/2, tbx15/18/19.  
   • Patterning and axial-identity genes: dense Hox A/B/C/D coverage (e.g. hoxa4-a11, hoxb1-b10, hoxc6/8/9, hoxd3-d12).  
   • Wnt, Fgf and Notch pathway components (fgf8a, fgf24, fgfr1/2, wnt3a/4/7ab/8a, dlc, her3/7).  
   • Matrix / adhesion genes typical of emerging mesenchyme (many collagens, fn1, loxl1/2, itga5/8, itgb5/6, pdgfra).  
   • Progenitor / proliferation cues (lin28a, hmga2, e2f family targets).

3. Motif enrichment  
   • The cluster is strongly enriched for binding sites recognised by the IRF family (irf1/2/4/5/6/8/9).  Although best known for immune roles, several IRFs are expressed in early zebrafish mesoderm and have been implicated in extracellular-matrix remodelling and convergent-extension movements.  
   • Secondary motifs point to SOX, FOX and HOX inputs, fitting the gene repertoire above.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Cluster 21 corresponds to an early “trunk mesoderm / PSM enhancer set”.  It is switched on in tail-bud axial progenitors, stays active while cells ingress into the presomitic mesoderm, and is progressively shut down as they segment and differentiate.  The element collection encodes TF logic (HOX for positional identity, SOX/FOX for progenitor status, IRFs for tissue remodelling) and drives a gene programme that equips nascent paraxial mesoderm with motility, adhesion and signalling properties required for somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 22

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 22 corresponds to a set of chromatin regions that are broadly accessible in early embryos but become strongly and almost exclusively activated in surface ectoderm as somitogenesis proceeds.

1. Spatiotemporal pattern  
• Accessibility is modest (log-counts ≈ 6–7) in most tissues at 0–15-somite stages.  
• It rises steadily in epidermis (7.7 at 10 s, 8.1 at 15 s, 8.7 at 20 s) and then explodes at the 30-somite stage (94.8), while remaining low in all other lineages.  
• A milder late increase is seen in related ectodermal derivatives such as enteric neurons and neural tube (≈ 7–8), consistent with general ectoderm maturation.

2. Gene content  
The 7 000 + peaks map to genes typical of differentiating skin/periderm and basement-membrane formation:  
• Structural / adhesion: many keratins (krt5, krt17, krt18a, krt98), integrins (itga4/5/6, itgb4/6), collagens (col17a1b, col7a1, col4a1/a2), laminins (lamc1/2, lama1/2, lamb1/2) and cadherins (cdh1, cdh4, cdh7).  
• Barrier and remodelling enzymes: tgm1, mmp14a/b, mmp17a, mmp25a, claudins (cldn15b, cldn17).  
• Signalling components associated with ectoderm patterning (wnt3, wnt6b, fgf10, bmp4/7, egfr-ligand adam17).  
Altogether these genes are hallmarks of epidermal differentiation and extracellular-matrix assembly.

3. Enriched transcription-factor motifs (row 22)  
The most over-represented motifs belong to the TALE/PBX–MEIS family (pbx1/2/3/4, pknox1/2, meis1/2/3), together with AP-1 factors (FOS/JUN family, ATF3/JDP2) and oxidative-stress regulators (NFE2L/Nrf).  These TFs are known co-factors of Hox proteins and are frequently involved in epithelial maturation and wound-response programmes.  Their presence suggests that the epidermal enhancers in cluster 22 are driven by PBX/MEIS complexes, possibly cooperating with AP-1 to integrate retinoid/Hox and stress-responsive cues during late epidermal morphogenesis.

In summary, peak cluster 22 defines an epidermis-specific regulatory module that switches on late in somitogenesis, controls large numbers of keratin-, ECM- and adhesion-related genes, and is predicted to be regulated primarily by PBX/MEIS together with AP-1 and Nrf-like transcription factors.
]

## Cluster 23

[*assistant*:
Peak‐cluster 23 corresponds to a set of regulatory regions that are open essentially everywhere and at every stage that we sampled.

1. Chromatin accessibility pattern  
   • The pseudobulk ATAC signal is high (≈ 300–400 norm. counts) in every lineage – neural, mesodermal, endodermal, epidermal, germ-line and extra-embryonic – and changes only modestly from the 0- to the 30-somite stage (often climbing by ~10–20 %).  
   • The highest values are seen in strongly proliferative or metabolically active tissues (e.g. haematopoietic/vasculature, tail-bud, later somite mesoderm), but even the lowest tissues remain strongly accessible, indicating near-ubiquitous activity.

2. Associated genes  
   • The peak set is linked to >2 000 genes that encode core “house-keeping” and growth-related functions: ribosomal proteins (RPL/RPS), cytoskeleton (ACTB1/2, ACTN1/4), translation factors (EEF1/2 family), chromatin and transcriptional regulators (EP300, EZH2, KMT2A/B, CTBP1, SPEN, HDAC1), cell-cycle genes (MCMs, CCNB1, CDK6, E2F targets) and basic metabolic enzymes.  
   • Only a minority are lineage-restricted markers; most are required in all cells, consistent with the uniform ATAC profile.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   • The most over-represented motif is the CpG-island/CG-rich KDM2B/CXXC signature (direct hit: kdm2ba), characteristic of constitutive promoters.  
   • Additional enriched motifs are generic promoter/ubiquitous-factor sites: E2F, SP/KLF, NF-Y, NRF/NR2F, CREB/ATF, Nuclear Receptor half-sites (RAR/RXR/PPAR), YY1, CTCF, TEAD/YAP.  
   • Lineage-specific motifs (HOX, SOX, FOX, PAX, GATA, MEF2, etc.) are present but at lower scores, consistent with their prevalence in promoters rather than reflecting lineage-restricted enhancers.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster 23 represents constitutively accessible promoter regions of housekeeping genes that support basal transcription, translation, cell-cycle progression and general metabolism during zebrafish somitogenesis.  
   • Its slight increase in accessibility at later somite stages and in highly proliferative tissues probably reflects rising biosynthetic demand rather than lineage specification.  
   • The predominance of KDM2B/CXXC, E2F and SP/KLF motifs, together with the gene content, positions this cluster as the genomic backbone that keeps the embryonic “core machinery” running in virtually every cell type.

In short, peak-cluster 23 is the ubiquitously active, CpG-rich promoter set driving housekeeping gene expression across the zebrafish embryo.
]

## Cluster 24

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 24 looks like the “house-keeping / constitutive-promoter” group of peaks rather than a lineage-restricted regulatory module.

1. Pseudobulk chromatin profile  
   • Accessibility is essentially flat (≈ 3.4–4.2) across almost every tissue and stage that was sampled – from tail-bud NMPs, neural crest, endoderm and epidermis to muscle and blood lineages.  
   • The only conspicuous excursion (heart-myocardium, 30 somites) is almost certainly a technical outlier; no parallel rise is seen at earlier cardiac stages or in other muscle populations.

2. Linked genes  
   • The peak set is tethered to several thousand genes, many of which encode core metabolic enzymes (ACSF3, ACSS2, GADPH-related members, FASN, PFKFB1/2), ribosomal or translation factors, cytoskeleton components (ACTC1, TUBA/B) and “general-purpose” trafficking / signalling proteins (RABs, ARFs, MAPKs).  
   • Canonical tissue-restricted markers are largely absent.  In other words, the gene catalogue is strongly enriched for transcripts that every cell needs at some level, consistent with the broad accessibility pattern.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   • The only over-represented motifs are those bound by basal transcription machinery: TBP/TBP-like (TBPL2), LIN54 (a core component of the MuvB/DREAM complex), SSRP1 (FACT complex) and POU2F1 (Oct-1) – factors that sit at promoters of constitutively active genes.  
   • No clear enrichment of lineage-defining TF families (e.g. GATA, SOX, PAX, NKX) is detected for this cluster.

Taken together, peak-cluster 24 represents a set of broadly accessible promoter regions that drive ubiquitous, foundational gene expression programmes required by virtually all embryonic cell types throughout somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 25

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 25 marks a set of regulatory elements that become progressively and very selectively open in the haemato-vascular lineage as somitogenesis proceeds.

1. Lineage/tissue specificity  
   • Nearly all cell types show only basal accessibility values around 5–7 log₂ CPM.  
   • In contrast, haemangioblasts and nascent haemato-vascular endothelium already reach >20 log₂ CPM at 5 somites and climb to >40 log₂ CPM by 20 somites – a ∼6-fold rise relative to the background of other lineages.  
   • Heart myocardium, lateral-plate mesoderm, early endoderm and endocrine pancreas display an intermediate signal (≈8–10 log₂ CPM), in keeping with their common anterior LPM/mesendoderm origin, but never approach the haemato-vascular peak.  
   • Neuroectodermal, paraxial-mesodermal and epidermal compartments remain low throughout.

2. Associated gene set  
   The loci linked to these peaks are highly enriched for established haemato-vascular regulators and endothelial markers, e.g. etv2, tal1/scl, lmo2, gata2/1, runx1, kdrl/flk1, flt1, tie1, erg, fli1a/b, tek, pecam1, vwf, vegfc, tal2, gfi1/1b and many Hox-A/B cluster genes.  The presence of pancreatic (pdx1), cardiac (nkx2-5, hand2) and endodermal (gata4/5/6) genes reflects the moderate signal seen in those mesendodermal derivatives.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • The most over-represented motifs belong to homeodomain factors (HOX, DLX, NKX, LHX, PAX, SIX, TLX).  These factors provide anterior–posterior and organ-field positional information to the lateral-plate mesoderm where haemangioblasts arise.  
   • ETS (ETV/Fli/ERG), GATA and RUNX motifs are also significantly enriched (rows 49, 38, 18 in the motif table), matching the canonical haemato-vascular transcriptional triad that drives endothelial and blood specification.  
   • Additional enrichment for T-box (TBX1/5/20) and SOX motifs is consistent with early mesendoderm competence.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   Cluster 25 therefore represents an enhancer repertoire that is first poised in broad mesendoderm/LPM progenitors, but becomes strongly activated specifically in haemangioblasts and the emerging vascular endothelium between 5 and 20 somite stages.  The regulatory code combines positional HOX/NKX inputs with lineage-defining ETS-GATA-RUNX factors to drive the haemato-vascular gene programme.
]

## Cluster 26

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 26 is dominated by binding sites for members of the nuclear–receptor super-family.  
Motif enrichment (all detected indirectly) is almost exclusively for

• classical retinoic-acid receptors (rarga, rargb, raraa / rarab) and their obligatory partners RXRs (rxraa / rxrab / rxrba / rxrbb / rxrgb)  
• lipid- and sterol-sensing receptors (pparaa / ppard a-b / pparg, nr1h3‐5 – LXR / FXR family, nr1i2 – VDR)  
• orphan receptors of the NR2F (COUP-TF), NR4A (nur77 / nr4a1-3), NR5A (sf-1 / nr5a1-2) and ROR branches (rora / rorb / rorc)  
• thyroid-hormone receptors (thraa / thrab / thrb) and related metabolic sensors.

Taken together, the cluster points to cis-regulatory regions that are responsive to retinoic acid, fatty-acid / sterol derivatives, hormonal cues and general metabolic state.

Consistent with this, the peak-associated gene list is heavily enriched for:

• lipid–handling and redox genes (numerous ABC and SLC transporters, ACAD/ACSL/ACOT family, CYP26A/B, FADS, MECR, SCD, FABP, FAR, DGK, PLA2, MBOAT, LPCAT, PLPP, etc.)  
• mitochondrial and peroxisomal metabolism (many β-oxidation enzymes, COQ, NDUF, CPT, PEX genes)  
• retinoid/sterol metabolism and signalling components (ALDH1A2/3, DHRS, LRAT, RDH, RBP, CRABP, STRA6, RBP7, RXR/RAR loci themselves)  
• additional nuclear-receptor genes and their co–factors (NR1H, NR2F, NR5A, NR4A, PPAR-γ-co-activators).

Pseudobulk chromatin accessibility is high and relatively even in most mesodermal, endodermal and neuroectodermal populations at all somite stages, indicating that these regulatory elements are used broadly during early zebrafish organogenesis whenever cells need to integrate systemic metabolic / endocrine signals.

In short, peak-cluster 26 represents a genome-wide set of metabolic and hormone-responsive enhancers under the control of RAR/RXR, PPAR, LXR/FXR, COUP-TF, ROR and related nuclear receptors, coordinating retinoid, lipid and energy metabolism programmes that are active across many germ-layer derivatives during somitogenesis.
]

## Cluster 27

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 27 corresponds to a set of cis-regulatory elements that become highly accessible in the prospective eye field and early optic cup, and remain moderately open in the developing retina during somitogenesis.

1. Cell-type/temporal profile  
   • Pseudobulk accessibility is by far highest in “optic cup_0 somites” (≈38-fold above background) and remains above baseline at 5–30 somites.  
   • Accessibility in most other tissues is low-to-moderate (values ~4–5).  A single very high value in “muscle_30 somites” is likely an outlier and is not supported by the gene content or TF motif data.

2. Gene content of the peaks  
   Linked genes are heavily enriched for retina / photoreceptor functions:  
   – Phototransduction: gnat2, pde6c, grk1b, opn4xa, opn8b, rorb, rorca.  
   – Retinal transcription factors & patterning genes: vsx1, crx family members (rx1/2/3), nr2e3, rax‐like genes, foxg1 paralogues, vax1/2, six3/6/7, pax6, tbx2/20.  
   – Adhesion / ECM genes typical of the eye cup (tenm2, tnc, efemp1, sorcs3).  
   Together they delineate photoreceptor differentiation and optic-cup morphogenesis programs.

3. Transcription-factor motif enrichment  
   • The only directly enriched motif is NR2E3 (row 27), a nuclear receptor that drives rod and cone maturation.  
   • Indirect motif set is dominated by eye-field and photoreceptor TFs (Pax6, Rax/Rx, Cux, Six, Vax, Fox, Sox), reinforcing the retinal identity.  
   • Absence of myogenic TF motifs argues against a genuine muscle signal.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Cluster 27 marks retina-specific enhancers that switch on at the onset of optic-cup formation (0–5 somite stages) and stay active as photoreceptors begin to differentiate.  Its regulatory logic appears to centre on NR2E3 and other nuclear receptors (RXR, ROR), together with canonical eye-field factors (Pax6, Rx, Six, Fox/Sox).  Peaks in this cluster therefore provide a genomic signature of early zebrafish retinal/photoreceptor lineage commitment.

## Cluster 28

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 28 corresponds to a strongly neuro-specific set of open chromatin regions.  

1. Cell-type / stage profile  
• Accessibility is negligible in mesodermal or endodermal samples but rises steadily in neural derivatives over somitogenesis.  
• The signal is highest in differentiating neurons, enteric-neuron clusters, spinal cord, hind- / mid-brain and neural-crest derivatives, especially from 15- to 30-somite stages.  

2. Associated gene repertoire  
The nearest genes are almost exclusively neuronal or neuro-developmental: synaptic receptors and channels (GRIN2B, GRIK2/3, CACNA2D1/3, KCNB2, GABRB2), axon-guidance and adhesion molecules (NRXN2, LRRTM4, CDH18, KIRREL3, ROBO1/4, SEMA4F, EPH/EPHRIN, L1CAM family), signalling and transcription factors needed for neuronal subtype specification (NPAS3, TCF4, PRMT8, TRIM67).  Functional enrichment points to synaptic transmission, calcium signalling and axonogenesis.

3. Motif enrichment  
Cluster 28 is enriched for TALE-homeobox/Meis–Pknox motifs (MEIS1/2/3, PKNOX1/2) together with TGIF1 and a TP53-like element.  MEIS/PKNOX proteins act as Hox cofactors that set anteroposterior positional identity in the neural tube, while TGIF and p53 sites often mark active developmental enhancers.

Taken together, peak cluster 28 represents a Meis-regulated enhancer programme that switches on as neural progenitors exit the cell cycle and differentiate.  It likely drives the late-somite-stage acquisition of neuronal identity along the neural tube and in neural-crest-derived lineages, coordinating genes required for axon outgrowth, synaptogenesis and mature neuronal function.

## Cluster 29

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 29 marks a set of chromatin regions that become highly accessible in the posterior axis of late embryos.  

1. Spatiotemporal accessibility  
   • The pseudobulk profile shows a sharp accessibility spike in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) at the 30-somite stage (≈64-fold above background) and in the tail-bud at the same age (≈71-fold).  
   • Accessibility is only baseline (≈4–6 a.u.) in most earlier stages and in more anterior tissues, indicating that these elements are switched on specifically in the maturing trunk/tail region.

2. Gene neighbourhood  
   The peaks lie near many classical posterior mesoderm / segmentation genes (e.g. msgn1, tbx6, ripply2-like, cdx4, evx1/2, tbxta, noto) as well as EMT-related factors (snai1/2/3, zeb1/2).  This composition is typical of regulatory elements that drive paraxial-mesoderm commitment, epithelial–mesenchymal transition and early myogenesis.

3. Transcription-factor signature  
   Motif enrichment is dominated by:  
   • E-proteins (Tcf3/Tcf12) – general bHLH partners needed for early lineage priming.  
   • Mespab – the zebrafish homologue of mammalian Mesp2 that gates the segmentation clock.  
   • Hand2 – lateral-plate / branchial-arch bHLH TF active in posterior mesoderm.  
   • Snai (Snai1/2/3) and Zeb1a/b – canonical EMT drivers.  
   • Mesodermal HLH Nhlh2 and secretogranin-related Scrt factors.  

   The combination of segmentation (Mesp), EMT (Snai/Zeb) and generic bHLH partners (Tcf3/12) strongly suggests that these enhancers are bound by complexes orchestrating the transition from epithelial somite precursors to migratory mesenchyme and nascent muscle.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Taken together, cluster 29 likely represents late-acting posterior neuromesodermal/somite enhancers that:  
   • switch on as the tail extends,  
   • integrate inputs from the segmentation clock and EMT machinery, and  
   • prime paraxial mesoderm cells for differentiation into skeletal muscle and other trunk derivatives.

In short, peak-cluster 29 captures the regulatory landscape that drives posterior somite formation and the accompanying epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in the zebrafish tail.

## Cluster 30

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 30 represents a set of chromatin regions that become progressively more accessible as cells leave the axial progenitor (NMP/PSM) pool and differentiate toward neurons, with a striking climax in late-stage enteric neurons.

1. Cell-type/time-course accessibility  
   • Moderate accessibility in early NMPs and PSM (≈3 a.u.).  
   • Gradual rise in differentiating neurons (from 3.1 at 0-som to 6.1 at 30-som).  
   • Explosive increase in enteric-neuron samples, peaking at 31 a.u. at 30-somites, far above all other tissues.  
   • Most non-neural tissues remain at basal levels (~3), indicating relative specificity for the neurogenic/enteric lineage.

2. Associated genes  
   The peak-linked gene set is heavily enriched for neuronal and synaptic functions: adhesion/recognition molecules (NRXN2, KIRREL3, LRFN2, TENM2), synaptic vesicle components (UNC13B, RIMS2), ion-channels and receptors (GRIK2/3/4, GRM7, PIEZO2, CACNA genes), guidance cues (SEMA4F, ROBO1, PLXNs), transcription factors involved in neurogenesis (NPAS3, ZNF521, ZEB2), and many neural-crest/axonogenesis genes.  
   This molecular signature fits late maturing peripheral/enteric neurons rather than early neural progenitors or central neurons.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • Strong SOX and FOX family motifs (SOX10/11/21, FOXD3/F), typical of neural-crest-derived lineages.  
   • PBX/HOX, PAX, NKX and IRX motifs, reflecting axial patterning information carried forward into the enteric nervous system.  
   • MEF2 and E2F clusters suggest roles in terminal neuronal maturation and cell-cycle exit.  
   • Additional enrichment for NR (retinoid-, thyroid-, and orphan-receptor) motifs hints at hormonal / ligand-dependent fine-tuning during maturation.

Summary  
Peak-cluster 30 marks regulatory elements that switch on during the transition from multipotent axial progenitors to neural-crest-derived neurons, reaching maximal activity in late enteric neurons. Its gene content and motif landscape point to SOX/FOX-driven activation of a broad synaptic/neuronal programme, modulated by HOX/PAX patterning factors and MEF2-dependent maturation cues. In short, cluster 30 captures the chromatin signature of maturing enteric neurons in the zebrafish trunk during the 15- to 30-somite stages.

## Cluster 31

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 31 contains regulatory elements that remain broadly inaccessible during early somitogenesis but open abruptly in mid- to late-stage posterior axial tissues.

1. Where and when the peaks open  
   • NMPs: background accessibility is low (≈6 arbitrary units) from 0- to 20-somites, then jumps to ~56 units at 30-somites.  
   • Tail-bud (0 somites) already shows a first pulse (≈28 units), suggesting the programme is initiated in the posterior organiser.  
   • Notochord: the strongest signal is seen at 20-somites (≈68 units), indicating full activation in the differentiating mid-line.  
   • Other tissues keep basal values (~5-6); only enteric neurons at 30-somites show a modest rise (≈12 units).  
   Altogether, the accessibility profile points to a posterior/​mid-line module that switches on late, just as NMPs exit the tail-bud and the mature notochord is being built.

2. Associated genes  
   The peak set is coupled to hundreds of loci that include:  
   – Classical mid-line / axial regulators (noto, shh‐pathway components, tbx18/20/22, tcf7l1, fgf18, bmp6, fgfr1b).  
   – Many matrix-remodelling genes (adamts2/5/9/12, adamtsl3, multiple collagens) required for notochord sheath formation.  
   – A dense assortment of Hox, Fox, and Six family members that pattern the antero-posterior axis.  
   – Retinoic-acid metabolic and response genes (aldh1a3, cyp26 family, rdh, rxr/rar targets), fitting with the motif data.

3. Motif / TF enrichment  
   • The most significant motifs belong to the nuclear-receptor super-family: RAR/RXR, ROR, NR2F, PPARG/PPARδ, NR4A, ESR.  
   • Additional hits for LIN54/KDM2 (chromatin remodelling) and RA-coupled pioneer factors such as FOXA/F.  
   Interpretation: the elements are primed for direct binding by retinoic-acid receptors and other ligand-activated nuclear receptors, consistent with the strong RA dependence of posterior axial differentiation.

4. Biological interpretation  
   Peak-cluster 31 therefore represents a late, retinoic-acid–responsive enhancer module that is:  
   – seeded in the tail-bud,  
   – maximally active in differentiating notochord and late NMPs,  
   – driving genes required for posterior patterning, ECM assembly and mid-line maturation.

In short, cluster 31 captures the RA-dominated transcriptional switch that converts posterior neuromesodermal progenitors into a mature notochord and adjacent mid-line structures during the 20–30-somite window.

## Cluster 32

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 32 corresponds to a set of regulatory elements that are accessible in many somitogenesis-stage cell types but are slightly more open in trunk lineages such as neuromesodermal progenitors, paraxial mesoderm (PSM/somites), differentiating neurons and enteric‐neural derivatives.  Accessibility rises modestly as development progresses (0 → 30-somite stages) and a single very high signal in the 30-somite midbrain–hindbrain sample hints at a local burst of activity in that region.

Motif analysis is strikingly dominated by the nuclear-receptor super-family: RAR/RXR pairs, PPARs, RORs, Rev-Erbs (NR1D1/2/4), COUP-TFs (NR2F1/2/6), ESR1/2, VDR and thyroid-hormone receptors (THRA/B).  No other TF family is comparably represented.  This strongly suggests that the peaks in cluster 32 serve as hormone-responsive cis-elements that integrate retinoic-acid, lipid/PPAR, steroid/estrogen, circadian ROR and thyroid-hormone signalling.

Consistent with this, the associated gene set is rich in classic nuclear-receptor targets involved in lipid transport and metabolism (many ABC and SLC transporters, ACACA/FASN, CPT1), extracellular-matrix remodelling (multiple COL, MMP, ADAMTS genes), patterning factors (FGFs, Wnts, HOXes) and additional nuclear receptors themselves (raraa, rarab, rxraa, rxrab, pparaa/ab, rora/b/c).  Together these genes underpin metabolic maturation, axial patterning and neuro-mesodermal cell-type diversification.

In summary, peak cluster 32 defines a broadly deployed “hormone-sensor” chromatin module that equips trunk mesodermal and neural progenitors with the ability to respond to lipophilic morphogens—particularly retinoic acid—but also thyroid, estrogen and PPAR ligands, thereby coordinating metabolic and patterning programs during mid-somite stage zebrafish development.

## Cluster 33

[*assistant*:
Peak-cluster 33 corresponds to a large set of regulatory elements that are most accessible during early- to mid-somite stages (0–15 som) and that remain moderately open in many tissues at later stages.  Accessibility is consistently high in differentiating neurons, haemangioblasts, fast/slow muscle, endocrine pancreas and heart myocardium, suggesting that the same cis-regulatory module is reused in a broad spectrum of lineages while the embryo is being segmented.

Gene assignment points to a “patterning / early differentiation” programme: the peak set sits near dozens of homeobox and other developmental regulators (numerous Hox paralogues, pax1/2/5/6/8, nkx, lhx, six, fox, irx, meox, tlx, barhl, dlx, msx, runx, tbx, etc.) together with signalling components of the FGF, Wnt, BMP, RA and Notch pathways.  These genes form the core of axial, neural-tube, eye, sclerotome, kidney and placodal specification networks.

Motif analysis highlights a dominant enrichment for PAX family binding sites (row 33: pax2a/2b, pax1a/1b, pax5, pax6a/6b, pax8), together with SOX, FOX and HOX motifs.  This implies that PAX factors act as key pioneer/lineage-selector transcription factors for the cluster, with SOX/FOX partners and HOX positional cues fine-tuning tissue-specific outputs.

Taken together, peak-cluster 33 represents a multi-lineage, PAX-centred enhancer repertoire that is transiently maximised during the segmentation period to drive the earliest steps of organ-specific patterning in both ectodermal (neural/placodal/optic) and mesodermal (somitic, mesenchymal, haemato-vascular) derivatives.
]

## Cluster 34

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 34 corresponds to a neural–crest-biased chromatin programme that switches on just after gastrulation and reaches its maximal activity between ~10 and 20 somites.  

1. Where it is open  
   • Highest pseudobulk accessibility is seen in neural-crest cells (5 → 30 somites; 19–43 AU) and their early derivatives – enteric neurons (8.6–10.3 AU), differentiating neurons (6.7–7.9 AU) and dorsal spinal cord.  
   • Accessibility is only moderate in generic neural tube, epidermis and mesoderm (PSM, LPM, muscle) and low in endodermal or endothelial populations.

2. Gene content  
   The associated gene set is rich in classical neural-crest specifiers and effector genes, e.g. sox10, sox9/8/6, foxd3, pax3/7, mitfa, tyr, lef1, tfec, zeb2a, snai1/2, cntn2, ngfrb, sema4ab, plxna3, pdgfra, itga8/9, col16a1, loxl1/2 – genes involved in crest specification, migration, melanocyte differentiation and cranio-facial mesenchyme formation.

3. Regulatory logic  
   • Motif enrichment (cluster 34) is dominated by SOX, PAX, DLX/BARX/HOX, PBX/MEIS, FOX and TFAP2 families – all core components of the neural-crest GRN.  
   • The presence of MITF/TFE, LEF/TCF and AP-1 (FOS/JUN) motifs points to pigment-lineage and Wnt/RTK responsiveness typical for migrating crest cells.

4. Developmental interpretation  
   Together, the accessibility profile, gene repertoire and motif landscape indicate that peak cluster 34 represents a set of enhancers that drive the specification, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, migration and early multipotency of zebrafish neural-crest cells, with lingering activity in certain neuronal and melanocyte derivatives.

## Cluster 0

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 0 corresponds to a broad “pan-neuronal” chromatin module.

1. Accessibility pattern  
   • Nearly all nervous‐system pseudobulks show moderate signal, but differentiating-neurons, enteric-neurons, spinal cord, hind-/mid-brain and generic “neurons” exhibit a sharp rise after the 10-somite stage (e.g. differentiating-neurons: 2.9 → 9.7 → 12–14 AU).  
   • Mesoderm-, endoderm- and epidermis-derived pseudobulks remain at baseline (~1.5–2 AU).  
   → The peaks therefore mark regulatory regions that switch on as neurogenesis begins and continue to strengthen through early organogenesis.

2. Gene content (representative)  
   • Synaptic vesicle/exocytosis: snap25b, syn1, syt1a, sv2bb/sv2ca, cplx2.  
   • Axon guidance/adhesion: unc5c, robo-like cntn/cntnap family, nrxn2a/3b, sdk1b, tenm2, tnr, trim67.  
   • Neurotransmission/channel activity: cacna1bb/a2d4b, gria3b, grin2bb, ryr3, scn3b, gabrb4, drd2b.  
   • Neural TFs and regulators: foxn2, rbfox1/3, ebf1, nrg1, nfixa/b, pou6f2, pknox2, onecut3b, wt1a.  
   These genes are hallmarks of maturing neurons (axonal extension, synaptogenesis, neurotransmission).

3. Motif enrichment  
   Highest z-scores map to motifs recognised by neuronal transcription factors, most prominently:  
   • MYRF (myelin/neuronal maturation),  
   • OSR1/2,  
   • SOX/FOX family, E–box/NeuroD class, and several HOX/POU homeodomain factors.  
   Collectively these TFs drive neuronal differentiation and the later maturation programme captured by the gene list above.

Interpretation  
Peak cluster 0 represents enhancers/promoters that become progressively more accessible as embryonic neurons exit the progenitor state, extend axons and form synapses. Its activity is largely confined to neuroectoderm-derived lineages (central and peripheral), with minimal activity in non-neural tissues. Functionally, it encodes the transcriptional circuitry for neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic competency during 10–24 hpf somitogenesis.

## Cluster 1

[*assistant*:
Peak cluster 1 – “house-keeping / core developmental programme”  

1. Accessibility profile  
   • The pseudo-bulk signal is detectable in virtually every cell type and at every somitic stage (values ~2-2.5 log-CPM).  
   • No single lineage dominates, although paraxial-mesoderm derivatives (posterior PSM, late somites, early muscle) show the very highest scores (e.g. PSM_30 s, 5.9).  
   • Only a few samples (e.g. NMPs_30 s, fast-muscle_0 s) fall to background, indicating that these peaks are never completely silent but can be modestly modulated.

2. Peak content and gene links  
   • >10 000 peaks are located at promoters or first introns and are associated with >7 000 genes.  
   • The gene list is dominated by “house-keeping” functions (ribosome, spliceosome, proteasome, TCA cycle, vesicle transport, cytoskeleton, ubiquitin pathway) together with a long tail of broadly-expressed developmental regulators (Fox, Sox, Hox, Pax, Tbx, Runx, E2f, etc.).  
   • Many of the linked genes are expressed in most or all single cells of the atlas, matching the near-ubiquitous accessibility of the peaks.

3. Motif enrichment  
   • The motif panel is very broad; the strongest z-scores (> 2) correspond to  
     – Forkhead/FOX family (FOXA/FOXC/FOXF/FOXO)  
     – SOX family  
     – Nuclear–receptor half sites (RAR/RXR/COUP-TF, NR2F)  
     – Generic promoter factors (E2F, SP/KLF, YY1/CTCF)  
     – General myeloid / RUNX-like sites (RUNX1/3) and MEF2/EGR/MAF motifs.  
   • This mixture is what is expected for constitutively open promoters that need to be recognised by many different TF families.

4. Biological interpretation  
   • Cluster 1 represents a set of constitutively accessible promoters/enhancers that support the basic metabolic and transcriptional needs of embryonic cells (“chromatin backbone”).  
   • The slight boost in PSM/somite samples suggests that, in addition to basal genes, the cluster also contains a subset of broadly-acting developmental regulators that become especially active in the paraxial mesoderm as somitogenesis proceeds.  
   • Because these peaks are never truly closed, they provide a permissive chromatin environment onto which lineage-specific clusters (described in other peak groups) can build more restricted regulatory programmes.

In short, peak cluster 1 captures the universal, always-on regulatory scaffolding of the zebrafish embryo, with modest tissue-specific tuning but no sharp lineage restriction.
